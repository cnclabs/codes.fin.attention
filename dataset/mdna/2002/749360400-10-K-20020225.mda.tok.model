the company has also implemented a reorganization of its solutions practices to centralize management oversight and to expand the sales and marketing of those services 
many of the company s clients are facing challenging economic times 
this is creating uncertainty in their ability to pursue technology projects  which had previously been considered a competitive imperative 
many clients are laying off their own permanent staff and reducing the demand for consulting services in attempts to maintain profitability 
this has had a direct impact on rcm s revenues 
most companies have recognized the importance of the internet and information management technologies to competing in today s business climate 
however  the uncertain economic environment curtailed companies motivation for rapid adoption of many technological enhancements 
the process of designing  developing and implementing software solutions has become increasingly complex 
companies today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing the initiatives they undertake 
this has had the effect of delaying or totally negating the spending on many emerging new solutions  which were formally anticipated 
nonetheless  it managers must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms  operating systems  databases and networking protocols  and must implement packaged software applications to support existing business objectives 
companies also need to continually keep pace with new developments  which often render existing equipment and internal skills obsolete 
consequently  business drivers cause it managers to support increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value  while working under budgetary  personnel and expertise constraints 
this has given rise to increasing demand for outsourcing 
clients are increasingly evaluating the potential for outsourcing business critical applications and entire business functions 
the company is positioned to take advantage of this accelerating trend 
the company presently realizes revenues from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end to end solutions 
these services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the company s consultants based upon their skill level  experience and the type of work performed 
the company also provides project management and consulting work which are billed either by an agreed upon fixed fee or hourly rates  or a combination of both 
the billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions work are higher than those for professional consulting services 
the company is currently working to expand its sales of higher margin solution and project management services 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued the majority of the company s services are provided under purchase orders 
contracts are utilized on more of the complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary 
contracts  although they normally relate to longer term and more complex engagements  generally do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on to days notice 
revenues are recognized when services are provided 
costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation related expenses for billable consultants  including payroll taxes  employee benefits and insurances 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development  recruiting  operating activities and training  and include corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities  including the company s acquisition program and corporate marketing  administrative and reporting responsibilities 
the company records these expenses when incurred 
depreciation relates primarily to the fixed assets of the company 
amortization relates principally to the goodwill resulting from the company s acquisitions 
these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for financial reporting purposes and have created goodwill  which is being amortized over a year period effective january  see footnote to financial statements

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues

as a result of the softness experienced in the it sector and the resultant revenue decline  management had been closely monitoring the operating results of its it branches throughout the year  instituting significant reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses and increasing efforts to revitalize sales levels 
however  during the fourth quarter  given the current economic environment and continued reduction of capital spending on technology  management determined that operating performance of certain of its branches indicated that the possibility of impairment of goodwill arising at acquisition might be impaired 
based on current operating results and existing business conditions  management projected cash flows for these branches and compared such projected flows to the carrying value of the respective branch s goodwill 
the analysis revealed that goodwill  amounting to approximately million million after taxes had been impaired and  therefore  would not be recoverable through future profitable operations of these branches

investing activities used million for fiscal as compared to using million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the reduction in the use of cash for investing activities for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a reduction in acquisition and deferred consideration payments 
financing activities principally debt reduction activities used million for fiscal as compared to financing activities providing  for fiscal as the company accumulates cash from operations  it often uses the cash to reduce its borrowings under the revolving credit facility but may consider using cash in the future for different purposes
