with respect to futures transactions  it means an interface between tradestation technology and the futures clearing firm s online execution system which  depending upon the type of futures contract  either sends the order directly to the trading pit or  for electronic futures markets  implements an electronic order placement and execution

variability of results the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period or for the full year  particularly given that we have recently completed a transition to a new business model 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past  and are likely to vary even more in the future due to that transition to the new business model 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
as budgeted expenses are based upon expected revenues  if actual quarterly revenues are below management s expectations  then results of operations are likely to be adversely affected because a large amount of our expenses do not vary with revenues in the short term 
in addition  operating results may fluctuate based upon the timing  level and rate of acceptance of releases of new products and services and or enhancements  fluctuations in the share volume of exchange transactions  conditions in the economy and securities markets  fluctuations in number and share volume of client trades  pricing changes  increased competition  variations in the revenue mix  and announcements of new products and services and or enhancements by us or our competitors  and other factors

forward looking statements  business risks this report contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  the words believes  estimates  plans  expects  intends  anticipates  contemplates  may  will  shall  assuming  prospect  should  could  would  looking forward and similar expressions  to the extent used  are intended to identify the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as in other sections of this report and in our other public filings and our press releases 
there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would likely result in significant volatility in our stock price quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group and its predecessor companies have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be expected to be even greater due to the unpredictability inherent in our recent change to a new business model 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to o cash flow problems that may occur  o market or competitive pressure to lower commissions and fees charged to customers  o our ability to successfully complete our transition from a revenue model based upon expensive  one time client software sales and low priced monthly subscription services to a revenue model based mainly upon brokerage commissions and fees as this requires increasing revenue from the new model to replace decreasing revenue from the old model in time to avoid depletion of all of our available cash  o the quality and success of  and potential continuous changes in  sales or marketing strategies which have undergone significant change recently and are expected to continue to evolve and the costs allocated to marketing campaigns and the timing of those campaigns  o the timing  completion  cost and effect of our development and launch of planned enhancements to the tradestation trading platform  o the timing and cost of completing a combined company infrastructure as a result of our december  merger  including information technology and databases  mechanisms and methods of delivery of products and services  administrative functions  technology development and sales and marketing  o payment in whole or in part of a million pending insurance claim  o the size and frequency of any trading errors for which we ultimately suffer the economic burden  in whole or in part  o changes in demand for our products and services due to the rapid pace in which new technology is offered to customers in our industry  o costs or adverse financial consequences that may occur with respect to regulatory compliance or other regulatory issues  particularly relating to laws  rules or regulations that may be enacted with a focus on the active trader market  o general economic and market factors that affect active trading  including changes in the securities and financial markets  and o delays and unanticipated costs in  or relating to  completing the build out of our new corporate headquarters  occupying the new headquarters  and or subleasing our two boca raton office facilities 
we may need cash in the foreseeable future we are experiencing a period of net losses 
while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of our existing and new product and service offerings as revenues from our discontinued product and service offerings continue to decline  the rate of customer acceptance of our new products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  price competition that may result in us charging lower commissions and fees to customers  costs and timing of expansion of research and development and marketing efforts  and the success and timing of the success thereof  and competing technological and market developments 
funds may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 
the new business model is one with no historical record  which makes business planning difficult because the new business model  ie  a direct access brokerage based upon an institutional quality internet based strategy trading software platform  is one with no significant historical record for our company  and  to our knowledge  one with no significant historical record for any other company  our attempts to predict the size of our market and our potential market share  to anticipate revenues and costs  to prepare budgets under the new business model  and to make decisions regarding obtaining third party financing that may be required  will generally be based upon theoretical assumptions 
future events and results may differ drastically from those planned or anticipated  which  if negative  would result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above 
our transition to the new business model has required rapid and substantial changes to our infrastructure we now depend upon a different operational infrastructure than the one which supported our client software business  and have substantially modified our approaches to technology development and sales and marketing 
those changes are still in progress 
our infrastructure must now support three separate kinds of business operations development of strategy trading tools  organization and delivery of streaming real time data and news  and direct access online brokerage services  all of which need to be seamlessly integrated in a unified product service offering 
this has required substantial changes in information technology and databases  mechanisms and methods of delivery of products and services  administrative functions  and use of personnel resources 
technology development has changed its focus from client software to internet and web site related technology  and sales and marketing has changed its focus from high priced client software sales to brokerage service commission revenues  the advertising of which is intensely regulated by governmental and quasi governmental authorities 
we have virtually no marketing or sales experience relating to brokerage services until very recently  our marketing and sales resources and personnel have been focused on client software and subscriptions 
now  we require a trained  licensed sales force and marketing and sales expertise that focus on financial services  ie  commission based brokerage services 
although we continue to use tradestation technology as a main selling proposition for what we offer  there are significant differences between selling software disks for one time license fees and software subscriptions for relatively low monthly fees  as compared to selling brokerage services  which requires customers to deliver to us a substantial dollar amount to open an account and to trust us to effectuate important financial transactions on their behalves 
we have virtually no marketing or sales experience relating to brokerage services  as tradestation securities has not  prior to the efforts recently commenced  used media advertising or fielded an experienced sales team to promote its brokerage services 
our brokerage s sales team  though trained and licensed  remains relatively inexperienced in the sale of brokerage services 
our failure to build and maintain a successful sales and marketing operation for our brokerage services will  regardless of the uniqueness or value of our technology  severely negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above 
fluctuations in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity our current and planned products and services are and will be marketed to customers who invest or trade in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in investing or trading decreases due to volatility or significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  such as has recently occurred  tax law changes  recession  depression  war  terrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
it is possible  if not likely  that increased losses by customers that occur as a result of any such recession  depression or other negative event will increase the quantity and size of legal claims that may be made against us 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for i online brokerage services  ii client software and internet based trading tools and iii real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation of those three products and services occurring in the industry 
our new business model embraces this evolution and consolidation 
however  we believe that due to the current and anticipated rapid growth of the market for integrated trading tools  real time market data and online brokerage services  competition  as well as consolidation  will substantially increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
these include the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to integrate the respective businesses in an orderly  efficient and otherwise successful manner  the design and support of efficient  materially error free internet based systems  product and service functionality  data availability  ease of use  pricing  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing efforts 
see item business competition 
the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of litigation involving the securities brokerage industry  including class action and other suits that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
additionally  our other products and services are used by traders in the financial markets  and  as a result  an investor or trader might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading tools or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
this risk is heightened by our offering of online brokerage services seamlessly integrated with real time strategy trading tools 
in particular  our proprietary order routing technology is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail or cause confusion or uncertainty to the user 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
see systems failure may result in our inability to deliver on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers below 
systems failure may result in our inability to deliver on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers we will be receiving and processing trade orders through internet based trading platforms and online order execution systems 
thus  we will depend heavily on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting this type of trading  including the strategy trading tools containing buy and sell alerts that initiate trading decisions or order placement 
heavy stress placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
additionally  the integrity of these systems is increasingly being attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  as a result of recent events  fears of cyberterrorism have heightened 
if these systems or any other systems in the trading process slow down significantly or fail  even for a short time  our brokerage customers would suffer delays in trading  potentially causing substantial losses and possibly subjecting us to claims for such losses or to litigation claiming fraud or negligence 
during a systems failure  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate securities broker s licenses can accept telephone orders  and an adequate number of associates may not be available to take customer calls in the event of a systems failure 
in addition  a hardware or software failure  power or telecommunications interruption or natural disaster could cause a systems failure 
any systems failure that interrupts our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers above 
our transition to the new business model places a significant strain on our management and operations our transition to the new business model has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
our future operating results will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to broaden our senior and middle management groups and administrative infrastructure  and our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled employees  particularly in marketing and sales  technology development  web site design and information technology 
the internet  as it grows  may have problems that affect our business there is the risk that  over time  the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace because of a failure to continue to develop the necessary infrastructure  such as reliable network backbones and adequate band widths  or the failure to develop complementary products and services  such as high speed modems 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental actions against us the securities industry is subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of the securities business 
regulatory authorities are currently focusing intensely on the online trading industry  particularly the segment that seeks the accounts of active traders 
the various governmental authorities and industry self regulatory organizations that supervise and regulate our brokerage have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
additionally  new rules relating to active traders have recently been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business model 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other personnel 
our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions in the future due to noncompliance 
dependence upon outside data sources creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide our customers with market data and news our business is dependent upon our ability to enter into contracts with private business information compilers in order to provide market data and news to customers 
we obtain such information pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private information compilers  some of which are our current or potential competitors 
these contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums 
we must also comply with rules and regulations of the exchanges that are the sources of market data information 
failure to comply could result in us becoming a prohibited recipient of market data from exchanges the rules or regulations of which were violated 
while we are not aware of any material data supplier contracts that are in jeopardy of being terminated or not renewed  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our current contracts with data sources  maintain comparable price levels for information  or negotiate additional contracts with data sources as necessary to maintain existing products and services or introduce new products and services 
there is no assurance comparable alternative sources of information would be able to be obtained should existing contracts be terminated or not renewed 
termination of our relationship with one or more information suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management  technology and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 
there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur a significant risk for our internet operations is that customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur 
we currently incorporate and plan to continue to incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that infringement claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects  or result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to one or more of our products or services 
the risk of infringement claims is heightened with respect to some of the tradestation technology because that technology  as opposed to our historical client software technology  has not stood any significant test of time 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading tool  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our products and services exists 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 
our brokerage must meet net capital requirements as a broker dealer that  if not complied with  could result in severe penalties  and which at all times limit our right to use all of its cash the sec  the nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by the nasd  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
if such net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the use of capital would be limited 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary will be restricted under sec rules  which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if required  and pay dividends in the future 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above 
loss of our clearing firm relationships could result in regulatory compliance issues our clearing relationships may be terminated by either party on days advance written notice 
if a clearing relationship terminates  tradestation securities would need to replace it with another appropriate clearing firm on substantially similar terms  as to which no assurance may be given 
if tradestation securities is for some reason unable to engage the services of any clearing firm  it would need to provide its own clearing to remain in business 
if it was to provide its own clearing  it would need first to meet certain financial strength standards  obtain regulatory approval which could be time consuming  and would subject itself to substantial additional infrastructure costs and increased net capital reserve requirements and other complex and intense regulatory requirements 
accordingly  termination of a clearing relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects
