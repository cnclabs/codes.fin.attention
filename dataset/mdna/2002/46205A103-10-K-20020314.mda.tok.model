item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a network television broadcasting company which owns and operates the largest broadcast television station group in the us  as measured by the number of television households in the markets our stations serve 
we currently own and operate broadcast television stations including three stations we operate under time brokerage agreements  which reach all of the top us markets and of the top us markets 
we operate pax tv  a network that provides family entertainment programming seven days per week and reaches approximately of prime time television households in the us through our broadcast television station group  and pursuant to distribution arrangements with cable and satellite distribution systems and our affiliates 
we were founded in by mr 
paxson  who remains our chairman and controlling stockholder 
we began by purchasing radio and television stations  and grew to become florida s largest radio station group  while also owning two network affiliated television stations and other television stations that carried principally infomercials and other paid programming 
in  we sold our radio station group and our network affiliated television stations to concentrate on building our owned and operated television station group 
we used the proceeds from the sale of our radio station group and network affiliated television stations to acquire television stations and build the pax tv network 
since commencing our television operations in  we have established the largest owned and operated broadcast television station group in the us  as measured by the number of television households in the markets our stations serve 
we launched pax tv on august   and are now in our fourth network programming season 
in september  nbc invested million in our company 
we have also entered into a number of agreements with nbc that are intended to strengthen our business 
under these agreements  nbc sells our network spot advertising and performs our network research and sales marketing functions 
we have also entered into jsas with nbc with respect to all of our stations serving markets also served by an nbc owned and operated station  and with many independently owned nbc affiliated stations serving markets also served by our stations 
during the year ended december   we paid or accrued amounts due to nbc totaling approximately million for commission compensation and cost reimbursements incurred under our agreements with nbc 
in december  we commenced a binding arbitration proceeding against nbc in which we asserted that nbc has breached its agreements with us and has breached its fiduciary duty to us and to our shareholders 
we also made two filings with the fcc  one of which requests a declaratory ruling as to whether conduct by nbc  including nbc s influence and apparent control over certain members of our board of directors selected by nbc all of whom have since resigned from our board  has caused nbc to have an attributable interest in us in violation of fcc rules or has infringed upon our rights as an fcc license holder 
the second fcc filing seeks to deny fcc approval of nbc s acquisition of the telemundo group s television stations 
the hearing in the arbitration proceeding is currently scheduled to occur in april  and we expect the arbitrator to render a decision by the end of may should the outcome of our arbitration proceeding against nbc or our fcc filing seeking a declaratory ruling as to whether nbc has an attributable interest in our stations require the unwinding or termination of some or all of these operating relationships  or should nbc or the nbc affiliates elect not to renew the agreements under which these operating relationships have been implemented  we could be required to incur significant costs to resume performing the advertising sales and other operating functions currently performed by nbc and our jsa partners or to transfer performance of these functions to another broadcast television station operator  which could have a material adverse effect upon us 
we derive our revenues from the sale of network spot advertising time  network long form paid programming and station advertising network spot advertising revenue 
we sell commercial air time to advertisers who want to reach the entire nationwide pax tv viewing audience with a single advertisement 
most of our network advertising is sold under advance  or upfront  commitments to purchase advertising time  which are obtained before the beginning of our pax tv programming season 
network advertising rates are significantly affected by audience ratings and our ability to reach audience demographics that are desirable to advertisers 
higher ratings generally will enable us to charge higher rates to advertisers 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for network advertising 
our network advertising sales represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  network long form paid programming 
we sell air time for long form paid programming  consisting primarily of infomercials  during broadcasting hours when we are not airing pax tv 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for long form paid programming 
our network long form paid programming represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  station advertising revenue 
we sell commercial air time to advertisers who want to reach the viewing audience in specific geographic markets in which our stations operate 
these advertisers may be local businesses or regional or national advertisers who want to target their advertising in these markets 
station advertising rates are affected by ratings and local market conditions 
we pay commissions of up to of gross revenue to advertising agencies for station advertising sales 
our station advertising sales represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  included in station advertising revenue is long form paid programming sold locally or nationally which represented approximately of our revenue during the year ended december  our revenue mix has changed since we launched pax tv in the percentage mix of our long form paid programming has declined from more than in to combined network and station long form in the year ended december  due to the increase in spot advertising sales following the launch of pax tv 
long form paid programming  however  continues to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we began entering into jsas with owners of broadcast stations in markets served by our stations 
after implementation of a jsa  we no longer employ our own on site station sales staff 
the jsa partner provides station spot advertising sales management and representation for our stations and we integrate and co locate our station operations with those of our jsa partners 
to date  we have entered into jsas for of our television stations 
our primary operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  programming expenses  employee compensation and costs associated with cable and satellite distribution  ratings services and promotional advertising 
programming amortization is a significant expense and is affected significantly by several factors  including the mix of syndicated versus lower cost original programming as well as the frequency with which programs are aired 
as we acquire a more complete library of lower cost original programming to replace our syndicated programming  our programming amortization expense should decline 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the most significant estimates involved in preparing our financial statements include estimates related to the net realizable value of our programming rights  barter revenue recognition  estimates used in accounting for leases and estimates related to the impairment of long lived assets  fcc licenses and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be critical since they have the greatest impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations and they require significant estimates and judgments 
we carry programming rights assets on our balance sheet at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of our program rights based on anticipated future usage of programming and the anticipated future ratings and related advertising revenues 
we evaluate the net realizable value of our programming rights by aggregating the program costs and related estimated future revenues for each programming daypart 
if estimated future revenues are insufficient to recover the unamortized cost of the programming assets in each daypart  we record an adjustment to write down the value of our assets to net realizable value 
we also evaluate whether future revenues will be sufficient to recover the cost of programs we are committed to purchase in the future  and if estimated future revenues are insufficient  we accrue a loss related to our programming commitments 
our estimates of future advertising revenues are based upon our actual revenues generated currently  adjusted for estimated revenue growth assumptions 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  we may not achieve our estimated future revenues  which could result in future write downs to net realizable value and accrued losses on programming commitments 
we have entered into agreements with satellite television providers and certain cable operators for carriage on their systems in exchange for advertising spots on our network 
we have recorded satellite and cable distribution rights related to these agreements based on the estimated value of the advertising credits at prevailing unit rates 
the satellite and cable assets are amortized over the terms of the agreements 
deferred revenue under these barter arrangements is recognized when the spots are aired on our network 
had we used other estimates  our revenues recognized under these agreements may have been different 
we have made judgments and estimates in connection with some of our leasing transactions regarding the estimated useful lives of the assets subject to lease as well as the discount rates used to estimate the present value of future lease payments 
these judgments and estimates have led us to conclude that these leases should be accounted for as operating leases 
had we used different judgments and estimates  these leases may have been classified as capital leases 
the terms of our senior credit facility  senior subordinated note indentures and outstanding preferred stock restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  including our ability to enter into capital leases 
we review our long lived assets  fcc licenses and goodwill for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if our analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset determined either by third party appraisal or estimated discounted future cash flows 
as described below under new accounting pronouncements  effective january   we are required at least annually to test for impairment of our fcc licenses and goodwill 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets  fcc licenses and goodwill have been impaired 
if  however  there were a material change in our determination of fair values or if there were a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize an impairment charge 
in addition  it is possible that the estimated life of certain long lived assets will be reduced significantly in the near term due to the anticipated industry migration from analog to digital broadcasting 
if and when we become aware of such a reduction of useful lives  depreciation expense will be adjusted prospectively to ensure assets are fully depreciated upon migration 
results of operations the following table sets forth net revenues  the components of operating expenses with percentages of net revenues  and other operating data for the periods presented years ended december revenues    less agency commissions    net revenues    expenses programming and broadcast operations    program rights amortization    selling  general and administrative    time brokerage and affiliation fees    stock based compensation    adjustment of programming to net realizable value    restructuring charge related to jsas   depreciation and amortization    total operating expenses    operating loss    other data cash flows used in operating activities    cash flows provided by used in investing activities    cash flows provided by financing activities    adjusted ebitda    program rights payments and deposits    payments for cable distribution rights    capital expenditures    adjusted ebitda is defined as operating loss plus depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  programming net realizable value adjustments  restructuring and other one time charges  and time brokerage and affiliation fees 
adjusted ebitda does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered in isolation 
we believe the presentation of adjusted ebitda is relevant and useful because adjusted ebitda is a measurement industry analysts use when evaluating our operating performance 
we also believe adjusted ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows because it measures our operating performance and cash flows  exclusive of interest and other non operating and non recurring items as well as non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and stock compensation 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  investors should consider various factors including its relationship to our reported operating losses and cash flows from operating activities 
we believe our adjusted ebitda trends reflect year over year improvements in our operating performance and cash flows since launching the pax tv network 
investors should be aware that adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and could be misleading unless all companies and analysts calculate such measures in the same manner 
the funds depicted by adjusted ebitda are not available for our discretionary use because of other commitments including but not limited to debt service under our debt facilities 
years ended december  and net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease is primarily attributable to lower station revenues offset in part by higher advertising revenues from the pax tv network 
the decrease in television station revenues is primarily due to reduced television spot advertising revenues in our local markets 
the increase in pax tv network advertising revenues resulted from increases in ratings and distribution of pax tv and favorable results from our network sales agreement with nbc 
on an overall basis  network spot revenues increased approximately in resulting from a strong upfront market for the broadcast season  which ended in august however  due to a weaker upfront market for the broadcast season  network spot revenues declined approximately in the fourth quarter and we expect this trend to continue through the end of the third quarter of our revenues during the year ended december  were negatively affected by the temporary loss of the broadcast signal of our new york television station when our antenna  transmitter and other broadcast equipment were destroyed upon the collapse of the world trade center on september  we are currently broadcasting from towers outside of manhattan at substantially lower height and power 
we are evaluating several alternatives to improve our signal through transmission from other locations  however we expect it could take several years to replace the signal we enjoyed at the world trade center location with a comparable signal 
we believe the loss of a significant portion of our over the air viewership in the new york market has had a negative effect on our revenues as a result of lower ratings for the pax tv network and our station serving the new york market 
we have property and business interruption insurance coverage to mitigate the losses sustained 
insurance recoveries will be recognized in the period they become probable of collection and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the preliminary stages of our insurance claim  we did not recognize any insurance recoveries in and are unable at this point to estimate the amount of insurance proceeds we will receive 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million in this increase is primarily due to a one time payment to terminate a tower lease and tower rent expense from the sale of certain of our broadcast towers in the fourth quarter of described below 
program rights amortization expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is due to syndicated programming changes and a greater mix of lower cost original programming as compared with last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during the year ended december  compared with million for the decrease is primarily due to lower selling costs and other cost cutting measures 
time brokerage and affiliation fees were million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to the completion of acquisitions of stations we previously operated under time brokerage agreements 
stock based compensation expense was million during the year ended december  compared with million for this decrease is due to a reduction in options vesting in the year ended december  compared with the programming rights adjustment to net realizable value described below was million during the year ended december  compared with million for depreciation and amortization expense was million during the year ended december   which was comparable with million for we expect our amortization expense to decrease in by approximately million as a result of adoption of sfas as further described below 
we have issued options to purchase shares of class a common stock to certain members of management and employees under our stock compensation plans 
as of december   there were  options outstanding under these plans 
in addition to these options  we have granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to members of senior management and others 
in connection with option grants  we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  and expect that approximately million of additional compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the outstanding options 
in october  we amended the terms of substantially all of our outstanding employee stock options to provide for accelerated vesting of the options in the event of termination of employment as a result of the consolidation of our operations or functions with those of nbc or within six months preceding or three years following a change in control of our company 
if any of these events occur  we could be required to recognize stock based compensation expense at earlier dates than currently expected 
in furtherance of our strategy to increase audience ratings through the development of pax tv original programming  in the third quarter of  we decided to gradually phase the syndicated program touched by an angel out of primetime and into the daytime period 
this program will be replaced in primetime with original programming 
based on this change  we adjusted our estimate of the anticipated future usage of touched by an angel and certain other syndicated programs and the related advertising revenues expected to be generated and recognized a charge of approximately million related to the net realizable value of these programming assets and related programming commitments 
the charge includes a million accrued loss related to programming commitments for the season of touched by an angel currently airing on cbs 
we are contractually obligated to license future seasons of touched by an angel if the series is renewed by cbs 
additional programming losses  if any  will be recorded at the time we become committed to license future seasons of this program 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to a greater level of debt in resulting from our july refinancing of our preferred stock and senior subordinated notes and borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
at december   total long term debt and senior subordinated notes were million compared with million as of december  although the july refinancing and the january refinancing described below reduced our overall cost of capital  the refinancings increased our debt and reduced our preferred stock  and as a result we expect our interest expense to increase in interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
during the year ended december   we sold five television stations for aggregate consideration of million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million 
years ended december  and net revenues increased to million for from million for  an increase of 
the increase in net revenues in was due to increases in advertising revenues from pax tv and our television stations 
the increase in pax tv network advertising revenues resulted from increased ratings and distribution of pax tv and the favorable effect of our network sales agreement with nbc 
the increase in station advertising revenues resulted from an increase in ratings and television station acquisitions 
our net revenues for were also favorably affected by increases in our long form programming rates 
programming and broadcast operations expenses were million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to completion of acquisitions of stations we previously operated under tbas 
program rights amortization expense was million in compared with million in the increase reflects the increased cost of new programming and greater usage of certain programs compared with last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to commissions paid pursuant to jsas entered into during time brokerage and affiliation fees were million in compared with million in the decrease was due to the completion of acquisitions of stations we previously operated under tbas 
in  we recorded a programming rights adjustment to net realizable value of million compared with million in resulting from changes in our estimated future usage of certain programming 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared with million in the increase was due primarily to acquisitions and accelerated depreciation on assets to be disposed of in connection with the jsa restructuring plan described below 
interest expense for decreased to million from million in the decrease was due to repayment in the fourth quarter of of debt of dp media  inc  a corporation formerly owned by family members of mr 
paxson that we acquired in june and whose financial results were consolidated with ours since september  at december   we had total long term debt and senior subordinated notes of million compared with million as of december  interest income for increased to million from million in the increase was due primarily to the investment of the cash proceeds from the september million investment by nbc 
during  we recognized a million gain from the modification of program rights obligations primarily resulting from our return of certain fully amortized programming rights in exchange for cash of million and the cancellation of our remaining payment obligations 
during  we recognized an approximately million pre tax gain on the sale of our interest in the travel channel llc and television stations 
this gain consisted of a million pre tax gain on the sale of our interest in the travel channel  a million pre tax gain on the transfer of our interest in station kwok serving the san francisco market during the first quarter of and pre tax gains of million on the sale of four television stations during the second quarter of the series b preferred stock issued in conjunction with the nbc transaction was issued with a conversion price per share that was less than the closing price of the class a common stock on the date of issuance 
as a result  we recognized a beneficial conversion feature in connection with the issuance of the stock equal to the amount of the discount multiplied by the number of shares into which the series b preferred stock is convertible 
the beneficial conversion feature calculated for  totaling approximately million  was reflected in our statement of operations as a preferred stock dividend during and was allocated to additional paid in capital because the preferred stock was immediately convertible 
in november  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus regarding the accounting for beneficial conversion features which required us to recalculate the beneficial conversion feature utilizing the accounting conversion price rather than the stated conversion price used for this change resulted in a cumulative catch up adjustment totaling approximately million  which was recorded as a preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter of restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we approved a plan to restructure our television station operations by entering into jsas with owners of broadcast stations in markets in which our stations were not already operating under jsas 
our restructuring plan included two major components termination of station sales and administrative employees and the closing of our leased studio and sales office facilities at each of our stations 
these restructuring activities resulted in a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  consisting of million of termination benefits and million of costs associated with the closing of our studios and sales offices that will no longer be utilized upon implementation of the jsas 
through december   we paid termination benefits to employees totaling approximately million and paid lease termination costs of approximately million  which were charged against the restructuring reserve 
we have made substantial progress in executing our restructuring plan  however due to events outside our control  including the events of september   we were unable to fully complete the plan in although we have completed the integration of our sales function at most of the jsa locations  we were unable to complete the integration of our master control operations at certain jsa stations in we now expect to substantially complete the jsa restructuring by the end of the third quarter of  except for contractual lease obligations for closed locations  which continue through to date we have been unable to reach an agreement with a jsa partner for four of the stations included in our restructuring plan 
although we intend to continue pursuing jsas for these stations  we are currently unable to determine the ultimate timing of these jsas 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of restructuring reserves primarily related to these four stations and certain other reserves which were no longer required 
upon full implementation of jsas  we expect to reduce our annual station operating expenses by approximately million consisting primarily of salary and occupancy costs 
these savings will be partially offset by commissions paid to our jsa partners which  based on actual station net revenues  would total approximately million 
actual commissions will vary based on actual revenues realized 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund capital expenditures for our television properties  programming rights payments and debt service payments 
our primary sources of liquidity are our net working capital  availability under the term a portion of our senior credit facility and proceeds from the planned sale of certain non core assets 
proceeds from the sale of these assets are expected to generate approximately million to million and include our second television station serving the boston market and the securitization of our accounts receivable 
we expect to receive the proceeds related to these asset sales during we believe that cash provided by future operations  net working capital  available funding under the term a portion of our senior credit facility and the proceeds from the planned asset sales will provide the liquidity necessary to meet our obligations and financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
if we are unable to sell the identified assets on acceptable terms or our financial results are not as anticipated  we may be required to seek to sell additional assets or raise additional funds through the offering of equity securities in order to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in selling assets or raising additional funds if this were to occur 
as of december   we had million in cash and short term investments and working capital of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our working capital decreased by approximately million due primarily to the use of million to pay interest  million to fund operations including programming and cable payments partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of certain of our towers and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these amounts primarily reflect payments for interest on our debt and the operating costs incurred in connection with the operation of pax tv and the related cable distribution rights and programming rights payments 
cash provided by used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these amounts include acquisitions of broadcast properties  capital expenditures  short term investment transactions  proceeds from the sale of television stations and our broadcast towers and other transactions 
as of december   we had agreements to purchase significant assets of broadcast properties totaling approximately million  net of deposits 
we do not anticipate spending any significant amounts to satisfy these commitments until or thereafter 
in december  we completed the sale and leaseback of certain of our tower assets for aggregate proceeds of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million which has been deferred and will be recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
as part of the transaction  we entered into operating leases related to both our analog and digital antennas at these facilities for terms of up to years 
annual rent expense over the lease term will be approximately million 
for certain tower assets with a net book value of approximately million  we were temporarily unable to transfer title or assign leases to the buyer at closing 
we expect to complete such transfers in in the interim  at closing we entered into management agreements with the buyer on terms consistent with the operating leases 
included in the million proceeds was approximately million of deferred consideration for the managed sites which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying december  consolidated balance sheet 
during  we acquired the assets of three television stations for total consideration of million  of which million was paid in prior years  and we paid million to acquire the minority interest in a station acquired in during  in addition to the acquisition of dp media described below  we acquired the assets of four television stations for total consideration of approximately million  of which million was paid in prior years  and we paid approximately million of additional consideration in respect of an acquisition completed in february during  we acquired the assets of five television stations for total consideration of approximately million 
in february  we also completed the acquisition of wcpx in chicago by transferring our interest in kwok serving the san francisco market as partial consideration for wcpx 
in connection with the transfer of ownership of kwok  we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in june  we completed the acquisition of dp media  inc before the acquisition  dp media was beneficially owned by family members of mr 
paxson 
we acquired dp media for aggregate consideration of million  million of which we had previously advanced during dp media s assets included a equity interest in a limited liability company that owns television station wwdp in norwell  massachusetts and is controlled by the former stockholders of dp media 
we allocated the aggregate purchase price of dp media to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair market values 
during the third quarter of  we advanced funds to dp media to fund operating cash flow needs 
as a result of our significant operating relationships with dp media and our funding of dp media s operating cash flow needs  the assets and liabilities of dp media  together with their results of operations  have been included in our consolidated financial statements since september  during  we sold our interests in five television stations for aggregate consideration of million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million 
during  we sold our interests in four stations for aggregate consideration of approximately million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million on these sales 
during  we sold our interests in four stations for aggregate consideration of approximately million and realized pre tax gains of approximately million on these sales 
in addition  in february  we sold a interest in the travel channel for aggregate consideration of approximately million and realized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the results of operations of the travel channel have been included in our consolidated statement of operations using the equity method of accounting through the date of sale 
capital expenditures  which consist primarily of digital conversion costs and purchases of broadcasting equipment for our station operations  were approximately million in  million in and million in except for television stations presently operating analog television service in the mhz band and stations given a digital channel allocation within that band  the fcc has mandated that each licensee of a full power broadcast television station  that was allotted a second digital television channel in addition to the current analog channel  complete the construction of digital facilities capable of serving its community of license with a signal of requisite strength by may  and complete the build out of the balance of its full authorized facilities by a later date to be established by the fcc 
for those stations now operating in the mhz band or allotted a digital channel within that band  the institution of digital television service may be delayed until december   or later than december  if it can be demonstrated that less than of the television households in the station s market are capable of receiving digital television signals 
despite the current uncertainty that exists in the broadcasting industry with respect to standards for digital broadcast services  planned formats and usage  we intend to comply with the fcc s timing requirements for the broadcast of digital television 
we have commenced migration to digital broadcasting in certain of our markets and will continue to do so throughout the required time period 
because of the uncertainty as to standards  formats and usage  however  we cannot currently predict with reasonable certainty the amount or timing of the expenditures we will likely have to make to complete the digital conversion of our stations  but we currently anticipate spending at least million  of which we have spent approximately million to date 
we will likely fund our digital conversion from availability under the million term a facility entered into as part of our july refinancing  as well as cash on hand  the sale of assets and from other financing arrangements 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in these amounts include the proceeds from the july refinancing described below  as well as the related principal repayments  redemption premium  preferred stock redemption and refinancing costs 
also included are proceeds from borrowings to fund capital expenditures  proceeds from preferred stock issuances and proceeds from stock option exercises  net of principal repayments and preferred stock dividends 
in january  we completed an offering of senior subordinated discount notes due in gross proceeds of the offering totaled approximately million and were used to refinance our exchange debentures due  which were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of our exchangeable preferred stock on january   and to pay costs related to the offering 
the notes were sold at a discount of  which represents a yield to maturity of 
interest on the notes will be payable semi annually beginning on july  the senior subordinated discount notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
in the first quarter of  we will recognize an extraordinary loss totaling approximately million resulting primarily from the redemption premium associated with the redemption of the exchange debentures 
on july   we completed a million financing consisting of a million senior credit facility and million of senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the initial funding under the senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes offering were used to repay all of our indebtedness and obligations under our previously existing credit facilities  which were scheduled to mature in june  to redeem our senior subordinated notes and our redeemable preferred stock and to pay redemption premiums  fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing 
in  we recognized an extraordinary loss related to early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately million resulting primarily from the write off of unamortized debt costs related to the refinanced indebtedness and the redemption premium and costs associated with the repayment of the senior subordinated notes 
the million senior credit facility consists of a fully drawn million revolving credit facility maturing june  a million delayed draw term a facility maturing december  of which million was outstanding at december   and a million fully drawn term b facility maturing june the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and the term a facility is available to fund capital expenditures 
we intend to use the term a portion of the facility to fund the majority of our capital expenditures through the end of the interest rate under the bank facility is libor plus or base rate as defined plus at the company s option 
the senior subordinated notes are due in and interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year 
we have entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap in the notional amount of million to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our variable rate indebtedness 
the fixed rate under the swap is and variable rates are indexed to libor 
including the impact of the swap  the weighted average interest rate of our indebtedness at december  was 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness except for specified indebtedness related to the funding of capital expenditures and refinancing indebtedness 
in addition  our senior credit facility also contains covenants restricting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  dispose of assets  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  create liens  make capital expenditures  make certain investments or acquisitions and enter into transactions with affiliates and otherwise restricting our activities 
our senior credit facility also contains the following financial covenants twelve month trailing minimum net revenue and minimum ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility for each of the fiscal quarters ended june  through december   and maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda  maximum ratio of total debt to ebitda  minimum permitted interest coverage ratio and minimum permitted fixed charge coverage ratio  each beginning for each of the fiscal quarters ending on or after june  our twelve month trailing minimum net revenue and ebitda covenants for are as follows in thousands fiscal quarter ending minimum net revenues minimum ebitda march    june    september    december    our ability to meet these financial covenants is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which include the effect on our revenues of overall conditions in the television advertising marketplace  our network and station ratings and the success of our jsa strategy 
although we currently expect to meet these covenants over the next twelve months  adverse developments with respect to these or other factors could result in our failing to meet one or more of these covenants 
if we were to violate any of these covenants  we would be required to seek a waiver from our lenders under our senior credit facility and possibly seek an amendment to our senior credit facility 
although we believe  based on discussions with our lenders  that we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments to our senior credit facility relating to these covenants  we can provide no assurance that our lenders under our senior credit facility would grant us any waiver or amendment which might become necessary 
if we failed to meet any of our financial covenants and our lenders did not grant a waiver or amend our facility  they would have the right to declare an event of default and seek remedies including acceleration of all outstanding amounts due under the senior credit facility 
should an event of default be declared under the senior credit facility  this would cause a cross default to occur under the senior subordinated note and senior subordinated discount note indentures  thus giving each trustee the right to accelerate repayment 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining alternative sources of funding to repay these obligations should these events occur 
contractual obligations and commitments we are obligated under the terms of our debt facilities  programming contracts  cable distribution agreements and operating lease agreements and employment contracts as of december  to make future payments as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt        programming contracts      cable agreements   operating leases and employment contracts        includes imputed interest of  in addition  under the terms of our programming contracts  as of december  we have committed to pay for certain programs for which we currently do not have airing rights as follows in thousands we are also committed to purchase at similar terms additional future series episodes of our licensed programs should they be made available

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute forward looking statements 
all items described are non trading 
our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we manage interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we use interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
interest rate swaps are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable  and thus  approximate current market rates 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates 
the fair value is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements
