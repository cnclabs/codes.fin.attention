item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction buckeye technologies inc and its subsidiaries the company manufacture value added cellulose based specialty products in the united states  canada  germany  ireland and brazil  and sell these products in worldwide markets 
on october   the company acquired essentially all of the assets of walkisoft  upm kymmene s nonwovens business  with manufacturing locations in steinfurt  germany and gaston  north carolina 
on august   the company acquired the cotton cellulose business of fibra  sa americana located in americana  brazil 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the application of accounting policies  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and estimated market values and compare that with the current cost of inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  inventory write downs may be required 
depreciation the company provides for depreciation on its production machinery and equipment at the cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
the depreciation is based on the expected productive hours of the assets and is subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change in the future  the company may be required to adjust depreciation expense per unit of production  accordingly 
other capital assets use the straight line method for determining depreciation 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas  goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will also be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically based on operating earnings adjusted by a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
if the estimates of future cash flows or their related assumptions change  additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
planned maintenance shutdowns the company accrues the cost of periodic planned maintenance shutdowns  over the period between shutdowns  based on its estimates of incremental spending and fixed overhead cost 
if the estimates of costs or the period between shutdowns are different than those projected  an adjustment to the accrual may be required 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  net sales for were million compared to million for  a decrease of 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower sales prices of fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens and lower shipment volumes of cotton cellulose 
fluff pulp prices steadily declined throughout but now appear to have stabilized 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales prices of cotton cellulose 
in  operating income was million compared to million for  a decrease of 
the operating income as a percentage of sales was compared to for operating income decreased mainly due to the sales issues previously noted  increased cost of cotton raw materials and the restructuring and impairment costs discussed below 
the decrease was partially offset by reducing sales  research and administrative expense by million or versus the prior year 
the reduction in research expenses was the result of focusing efforts on key projects 
the company s results have been adversely affected by the weak global economy and a strong us dollar 
during the year ended june   the company entered into a restructuring program 
the program is designed to deliver cost reductions through reduced overhead expenses 
the cost recorded during the year ended june   comprised mainly of severance and other employee benefit costs  is million 
involuntary termination benefits of million have been paid and million has been accrued as of june  payments related to the restructuring program are expected to continue into the second quarter of fiscal year as a result of the restructuring  approximately positions have been eliminated  resulting in cost reductions of about million annually 
an additional positions will be eliminated by the end of the first quarter of fiscal all costs of the program are reported in the statements of operations under restructuring and impairment costs 
the nonwovens and cotton businesses in north america and europe are impacted by this cost reduction program 
as part of this restructuring  the company has closed engineering offices located in finland 
during the quarter ended june   the company recorded impairment costs of million in the statements of operations under restructuring and impairment costs 
these impairment costs are primarily related to the write off of obsolete airlaid nonwovens packaging equipment that has been replaced with more efficient stacpac tm lines 
this equipment is expected to be disposed of during fiscal year net interest and amortization of debt costs for were million compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels 
the increase was partially offset by capitalization of interest of million on large construction projects during and the interest rate swap agreement that the company entered into during may  which exchanged fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest payments 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets as described in our critical accounting policies 
based on the assessment  effective july   the company has reduced its goodwill by million in the converting business  which was purchased as part of the merfin acquisition in there was no tax benefit recorded as a result of the reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill 
the company s effective tax rate for was versus in the change was primarily due to recognizing the benefit of research and development tax credits 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  net sales for were million compared to million for  a decrease of 
the decrease for the year was due mainly to lower shipment volumes and declining sales prices on fluff pulp 
the decrease in both shipment volume and sales price reflects the impact of the contractual changes in the fluff pulp supply agreement with the procter gamble company 
the formula priced agreement converted to a market price basis on january  and volumes specified in the agreement decrease from calendar year levels by in calendar year this decline was offset somewhat by the increase in sales due to the full year inclusion of the operations of walkisoft 
in  operating income was million compared to million for  a decrease of 
the operating income as a percentage of sales was compared to for the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and prices plus increased costs for cotton fibers  energy and caustic 
the lower sales and higher manufacturing costs were partially offset by a reduction of million in sales  research and administrative expenses for the year 
a substantial part of the reduction in sales  research and administrative expenses was due to decreases in incentive compensation expense 
net interest and amortization of debt costs for were million compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels to finance the americana acquisition  capital projects and higher inventory levels 
the increase was partially offset by the capitalization of interest of million on large construction projects during and the interest rate swap agreement that the company entered into during may  which exchanged fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest payments 
the company s effective tax rate for was versus in the decrease was primarily due to lower tax rates in germany as a result of recently enacted tax legislation 
effective july   depreciation on the company s production machinery and equipment at cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants was converted from the straight line method to the units of production method  which is based upon the expected productive hours of the assets 
this method more appropriately matches production costs over the lives of the production machinery and equipment of the cotton cellulose and airlaid plants with the revenues of those plants and results in a more accurate allocation of the cost of the physical assets to the periods over their useful lives 
the cumulative effect of applying the new method for years prior to is an increase to income of million net of tax million pretax reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  in addition  the net income of the company  excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change  for the year ended june  is million or 
per share more than it would have been if the company had continued to follow the straight line method of depreciation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for pro forma information 
financial condition cash flow cash provided by operating activities for the years ended june   and were million million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million  for the year ended june   million was due primarily to lower earnings  lower current liabilities and tax refunds not yet received partially offset by a smaller decrease in accounts receivable 
additional borrowings from the credit facilities  along with the cash provided from operations  were used to fund capital expenditures and to make the million note payment to upm kymmene for the purchase of walkisoft 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended june  was million compared to million for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due mainly to the completion of the large airlaid nonwovens machine at the gaston plant 
additionally  the prior year activities included the million acquisition of americana 
ebitda is presented as an additional means of evaluating the company s financial condition because the company incurs significant noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization  related to the material capital assets utilized in its operations 
ebitda is a central measure used in the company s compliance with debt covenants to its credit facility 
this measure should not be considered as a superior alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda  as adjusted earnings before goodwill accounting change  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and nonrecurring charges for the years ended june    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in ebitda in reflects the decrease in cash flows from operating activities

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in its production processes 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for risk management is included in the accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of the company s long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value of other long term debt approximates fair value based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million  respectively  and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates and amounts to million at june  and million at june  the company had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on the company s pretax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to us prime rates and european interbank rates 
at june   the company had one interest rate swap agreement with a total notional value of million  terminating on october  the company entered into the interest rate swap agreement on may  the agreement involves the exchange of fixed rate interest payments at for floating rate interest payments at three month libor plus over the life of the agreement without the exchange of any underlying principal amounts 
the net amounts paid or received under this interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
the company and its subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
therefore foreign currency exposures arising from transactions are not material to the company 
the company s primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the european euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company does not generally hedge these net investments 
however  the company uses capital structuring techniques to manage its net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential loss in value of the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million at june  and million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of the company s balance sheet 
cost of raw materials amounts paid by the company for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of the company s variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber  to the extent not reflected in prices for the company s products  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
commodities in order to minimize market exposure  the company uses forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of natural gas over a period of generally less than one year 
at june   the company had a natural gas contract outstanding with a fair value of million which is included in other assets 
the fair value is based upon exchange quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
while this contract does not qualify for hedge accounting  neither the effect on the results of operations nor the year end position was material to the company s overall results 
forward looking information the above risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
contingencies the company s operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
the company devotes significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
the company expects that  due to the nature of its operations  it will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors affecting the company s operations  markets  products  services and prices  and other factors 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events
