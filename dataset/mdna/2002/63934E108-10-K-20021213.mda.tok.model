the bonds were sold i n a private placement and priced to yield with a conversion premium of on a closing price of 
s imultaneous with the issuance of the convertible bonds  the company will enter into two derivative contracts  the consequences of which will allow the company to eliminate share dilution upon conversion of the convertible debt f rom the conversion price of the bond up to a premium over the share price at issuance 
it is the opinion of management that  in the absence of significant unan ticipated cash demands  current and forecasted cash flow as well as anticipated financing actions will provide sufficient funds to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
currently  under the limitations in v arious debt agreements  the company is generally unable to incur material amounts of additional debt 
the comp any is generally allowed under these limitations to refinance debt as it matures 
management believes that collec tions on the outstanding receivables portfolios as well as funds available from various funding sources will permi t the financial services operations to meet the financing requirements of international s dealers and retail custom ers 
environmental matters the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp  in co njunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the co mprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
the se cases involve sites that allegedly have received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to the company which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and character istics of material generated at  or shipped to  each site as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of the company s share  if any  of the probable costs and is provided for in the financial statements 
these obligations are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
the company reviews its accruals on a regular basis and believes that  based on these calcu lations  its share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect o n the company s financial results 
derivative financial instruments the company documents and accounts for derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for d erivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilit ies in the statement of financial condition and measures them at fair value 
when certain criteria are met  it also provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the derivative hedging instrument with the recognition of a changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of d erivatives which are not designated as  or which do not qualify as  hedges for accounting purposes are report ed in earnings in the period in which they occur 
as disclosed in notes and to the financial statements  the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate volatility and potentially increase the return on invested funds 
the company s manufacturing operations  as conditions warrant  hedg e foreign exchange exposure on the purchase of parts and materials from foreign countries and its exposure from t he sale of manufactured products in other countries 
contracted purchases of commodities or manufacturing equipmen t may also be hedged 
the financial services operations may use forward contracts to hedge fu ture interest payments on the notes and certificates related to an expected sale of receivables 
the financial s ervices operations also use interest rate swaps and caps to reduce exposure to interest rate changes 
for the pr otection of investors  nfc may enter into interest rate caps when fixed rate receivables are sold on a variable rate basis 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity wi th accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financ ial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of asse ts and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgm ents of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the sign ificant accounting principles which management believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are included below 
management also believes that all of the accounting policies are imp ortant to investors 
therefore  see the notes to the financial statements for a more detailed description of the se and other accounting policies of the company 
critical accounting policies continued sales allowances at the time of sale  the company records as a reduction of revenue the e stimated impact of sales allowances in the form of dealer and customer incentives 
there may be numerous ty pes of incentives available at any particular time 
this estimate is based upon the assumption that a certain nu mber of vehicles in dealer stock will have a specific incentive applied against them 
if the actual number of vehicl es differs from this estimate  or if a different mix of incentives occurs  the sales allowances could be affected 
sales of receivables nfc securitizes finance receivables through qspes  which then issue securities to public and private investors 
nfc sells receivables to the qspes with limited recourse 
gains or losses on sales of receivables are credited or charged to finance and insurance revenue in the periods in which t he sales occur 
retained interests  which include interest only receivables  cash reserve accounts and subordinate d certificates  are recorded at fair value in the periods in which the sales occur 
management estimates the prepayment speed for the receivables sold a nd the discount rate used to present value the interest only receivable in order to calculate the gain or loss 
estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are based on historical experience and other factors and are made separately for each securitization transaction 
in addition  nfc estimates the fair value of the interest only receivable on a quarterly basis 
the fair value of the interest only receivable is based o n updated estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates 
product warranty provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  fre quency  and average cost of warranty claims 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes ac tion to improve vehicle quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
product liability the company is subject in the normal course of business to product lia bility lawsuits and claims 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce the risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retention 
the company records product liability reserves for the self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability act ions 
the reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  management determines an appropriate case specific re serve based upon management s best judgment and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes in facts or circumstances surrounding the case 
second  manageme nt obtains a third party actuarial analysis to determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover cert ain known claims and all incurred but not reported product liability issues 
based upon this process management believes that the product liability reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred and the actual settle ment values of outstanding claims may differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
critical accounting policies continued pension and other postretirement benefits the company s employee pension and other postretirement benefits ie  health care costs and obligations are dependent on management s assumptions used by actuaries in calculating suc h amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trends rates  inflation  long term retur n on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
management bases the discount rate assump tion on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
health care cost tre nd assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likel y long term trends 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retire ment and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
actual results that differ from th e assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are a ppropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pensio n and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
see note to the financial statements for more informa tion regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
allowance for losses the allowance for losses reflects management s estimate of the losses i nherent in nfc s portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases 
the allowance is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate in relation to the outstanding portfolio based on factors such as overall portfo lio credit risk quality  historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
these factors require management judgment  and different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance for losses 
under various agreements  international and its dealers may be liable fo r a portion of customer losses or may be required to repurchase the repossessed collateral at the receivable princ ipal value 
nfc s losses are net of these benefits 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value o f a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carr ying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value could affect th e evaluations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas was adopted by the company on november   and it did not have a material impact on the compan y s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements iss ued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect that this statement may have on its financial position and results of operations  but does not believe it will have a materia l impact 
new accounting pronouncements continued in august  the fasb issued sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company has early ad opted sfas effective november  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the results of operatio ns for the current and prior periods of the company s domestic brazilian truck business  including the mill ion after tax loss on disposal  have been reported as discontinued operations 
see note to the financial stat ements 
in addition  as part of the plan of restructuring  the company reviewed its long term assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas and recorded an impairment charge of million  usin g a discounted cash flow basis

income taxes the statement of financial condition at october   includes a d eferred tax asset of  million  net of valuation allowances of million 
the deferred tax asset at octobe r   of  million is net of valuation allowances of million 
the deferred tax asset has been re duced by the valuation allowance as management believes it is more likely than not that some portion of the defe rred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at october   includes the tax benefit from cumulative tax net operating losses nol of  million  cumulative alternative minimum tax and research and development credits of million and cumulative expenses of  million that have not been deducted on the company s tax returns 
the valuation allowance was increased in by million related to certain foreign nol carryforwards and deferred tax assets  as management believes that it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized in the future 
the income tax expense related to the increase in the valuation al lowance is included in the loss from discontinued operations on the statement of income 
the company has no open tax years that are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs  and management believes th at it is unlikely the irs would limit utilization of the nols 
until the company has utilized its significant nol carryforwards and credits  the cash payment of us federal income taxes will be minimal 
see note to the financ ial statements 
the company performs extensive analysis to determine the amount of the n et deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based on the premise that the company is  and will continue to be  a goin g concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation o f future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company 
the financial results are evaluated using a number of alternati ves in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
one significant factor considered is the company s role as a leading producer of heavy and medium trucks and school buses and mid range diesel engines 
realizat ion of the cumulative deferred tax asset  net of liabilities  is dependent on the generation of approximatel y  million of future taxable income 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax pla nning strategies and the maintenance of significant truck and engine market share  sufficient earnings are achiev able in order to realize the deferred tax asset  net of liabilities  of  million 
income taxes continued currently there is no annual limitation on the company s ability to us e nols to reduce future income taxes 
however  if an ownership change as defined in section of the internal reve nue code of  as amended  occurs with respect to the company s capital stock  it would limit the use o f nols to specific annual amounts 
generally  an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase th eir aggregate ownership by more than percentage points of the company s total capital stock in any three y ear period 
if an ownership change occurs  the company s ability to use domestic nols to reduce income taxes is limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of the company immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt interest rate published monthly by the irs 
currently the company s change in ownership percentage is minimal 
reconciliation of the company s income loss before income taxes from continuing operations for financial statement purposes to us taxable income loss for the years ended october is as follows millions of dollars income loss from continuing operations before income taxes exclusion of income loss of foreign subsidiaries state income taxes temporary differences permanent differences us taxable income us business environment sales of class through trucks have historically been cyclical  wi th demand affected by such economic factors as industrial production  construction  demand for consumer durable g oods  interest rates and the earnings and cash flow of dealers and customers 
truck sales in have been hinde red by a number of factors including the overall state of the economy  rising insurance costs  tightened credit availability and a large decline in sales to leasing companies 
the demand for medium trucks and school buses r eflected these adverse conditions 
the company s us and canadian order backlog at october   is  units  compared with  units at october  historically  retail deliveries have been impacted by t he rate at which new truck orders are received 
therefore  in order to manage through the current downturn  the c ompany continually evaluates order receipts and backlog throughout the year by balancing production with demand as appropriate 
also  in an effort to reduce fixed costs and improve operating efficiencies the company announced the layoff of approximately workers at its springfield assembly plant  workers at its indianapoli s engine plant  workers at the indianapolis casting corporation and  workers at the chatham assembly plant  which started in the fourth quarter of as part of the plan of restructuring 
the company currently projects us and canadian class heavy truc k demand to be  units  down from class and medium truck demand  excluding school buses  is f orecast at  units  higher than in demand for school buses is expected to be  units  cons istent with mid range diesel engine shipments by the company to oems in are expected to be  unit s  higher than the company  through its subsidiary ic corporation f k a american transpo rtation corporation  announced the creation of a single brand identity for its line of integrated products  the rear engine  front engine and conventional school buses  which are built at ic corporation s conway  arka nsas and tulsa  oklahoma plants 
the new identity was unveiled to dealers of the integrated school bus product at the annual bus dealer meeting in april business environment continued on june   the company s collective bargaining contract with the national automobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of canada caw expired 
efforts to negotiat e a new labor contract with the caw failed  and on june   the caw struck at the company s chatham  ontari o heavy truck assembly plant  whose employees are represented by the caw 
the company quickly implemented con tingency plans designed to maintain production and shipment levels to meet the needs of its customers  including increasing premium conventional heavy truck production at its escobedo assembly plant in mexico 
on july   the company and the caw reached an agreement ratifying a new two year labor contract that expires in june on october   the company announced that it will close the chatham  ontario plant in the summer of  which was an option for the company under this new contract 
on october   the company s master contract with the united aut omobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw expired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rate s and currency exchange rates 
the company is also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in i ts manufacturing operations and to changes in the prices of equity instruments owned by the company 
commodity price risk related to the company s current commodity financial instruments and equity price risk related to th e company s current investments in equity instruments are not material 
the company does not hold a material portfolio of market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensi tivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of the company s level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables primarily with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables which may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce the company s exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losse s due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amo unt by which the fair value of all of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by sele cted hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  a nd  the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately million and million  r espectively 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curv es 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
foreign currency risk is the risk that the company will incur economi c losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar and brazilian real us dollar 
at october  and  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instan taneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instrument s would be approximately million 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that al l of the foreign currencies to which the company is exposed would simultaneously decrease by  because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the effects of foreign currency forward contracts have been included in the above analysis  however  the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with t he anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currency for which these forward contracts have been ent ered into for hedging purposes
