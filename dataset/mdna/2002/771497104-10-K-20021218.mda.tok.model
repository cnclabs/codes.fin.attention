the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at september  compared with million at september  the september  total includes a corporate bond from pacific gas electric pg e with a carrying value of  on september  this bond matured december  and  although pg e remains current on its interest payment obligations  the principal amount of this bond has not yet been paid 
on april   pg e filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
recently  pg e and the state of california asked pg e s creditors to vote on two separate reorganization proposals 
a certification of the results of voting was filed with the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of california on september  however  as of september   the bankruptcy court had not confirmed either plan of reorganization 
while pg e s management has stated their intent to pay their creditors  the numerous political and economic factors influencing the california utility market coupled with pg e s bankruptcy filing could potentially impact the timing and or actuality of payments 
however  the company currently believes that it will realize the full value of this investment 
the company used a net  of cash in operating activities during the year 
investing activities  primarily capital expenditures  used net cash of  in fiscal during the fiscal quarter ended june   the company entered into an agreement with coloplast granting coloplast exclusive marketing and distribution rights with respect to the company s release nf foley catheters in certain geographic areas

in december  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program 
up to one million shares of the company s outstanding common stock may be repurchased under the program 
purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market and through other customary means 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program and it may be conducted over an extended period of time as business and market conditions warrant 
the company also may discontinue the stock repurchase program at any time 
the repurchased shares will be available for reissuance pursuant to employee stock option plans and for other corporate purposes 
the company intends to fund such repurchases with currently available funds 
during fiscal  the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock 
although the company believes that its existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its capital needs for approximately the next two years  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing before that time 
the company s actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of the company s existing and new products  changes in  termination of  and the success of  existing and new distribution arrangements  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of the company s research and development efforts  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
critical accounting policies inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company s policy is to establish an excess and obsolete reserve for its products in excess of the expected demand for such products 
at september   this reserve was  which was equal to the amount of the reserve at september  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is calculated by a combination of specific account identification as well as percentages of past due balances 
at september   this allowance was  compared to  at september  new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement  which replaces statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
statement also broadens disposal transactions reporting related to discontinued operations 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt statement in fiscal and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
risk factors limited revenues  history of losses and potential future losses the company has generated only limited revenues to date and has experienced net losses since its inception 
net losses for the fiscal years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at september  the company s ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flow over the next several years will depend primarily upon market acceptance of  and achievement of material sales from  the company s intermittent catheters  the release nf catheter and the femsoft insert  of which there can be no assurance 
a substantial portion of the expenses associated with the company s manufacturing facilities are fixed in nature ie depreciation and will reduce the company s operating margin until such time  if ever  as the company is able to increase utilization of its capacity through increased sales of its new products 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate substantial revenues or achieve or sustain profitability 
even if the company achieves profitability in a particular fiscal period in the future  the company may experience net losses in subsequent fiscal periods 
dependence on distribution arrangements a significant portion of the company s net sales to date have depended on the company s ability to provide products that meet the requirements of medical product companies that resell or distribute the company s products  and on the sales and marketing efforts of such entities 
arrangements with these entities are likely to continue to be a significant portion of the company s revenues in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company s purchasers and distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the company s products  that they will devote sufficient resources to support the marketing of any of the company s products  that they will market any of the company s products at prices which will permit such products to develop  achieve  or sustain market acceptance  or that they will not develop alternative sources of supply 
the failure of the company s purchasers and distributors to continue to purchase products from the company at levels reasonably consistent with their prior purchases or to effectively market the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on a small number of customers we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales 
our five largest customers in fiscal represented approximately of our total net sales 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales 
because our major customers represent such a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business 
our major customers may not continue to purchase products from us at current levels or at all 
in the past  we have lost customers due to our customers changes in technology preferences  customers shifting production of products to internal facilities and the acquisition of our customers 
we may lose customers in the future for similar reasons 
we may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any sales shortfalls if we lose a major customer 
our attempts to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on particular customers may not be successful 
uncertainty of market acceptance of new products the company has several new products  including the hydrophilic and antibacterial intermittent catheters  the release nf catheter  and the femsoft insert  that represent new methods and improvements for urinary continence care 
there can be no assurance that these products will gain any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians  healthcare payors and patients 
market acceptance of these products  if it occurs  may require lengthy hospital evaluations and or the training of numerous physicians and clinicians  which could delay or dampen any such market acceptance 
moreover  approval of reimbursement for the company s products  competing products or alternative medical treatments  and the company s pricing policies will be important factors in determining market acceptance of these products 
any of the foregoing factors  or other factors  could limit or detract from market acceptance of these products 
insufficient market acceptance of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with marketing and sales of rochester medical brand products the company s success will depend on its ability to overcome established market positions of competitors and to establish its own market presence under the rochester medical brand name 
one of the challenges facing the company in this respect is the company s ability to compete with companies that offer a wider array of products to hospitals and medical care institutions  distributors and end users 
the company may also find it difficult to sell its products due to the limited recognition of its brand name 
highly competitive markets  alternative treatments  technological advancements the medical products market in general is  and the markets for urinary continence care products in particular are  highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors have greater name recognition than the company and offer well known and established products  some of which are less expensive than the company s products 
as a result  even if the company can demonstrate that its products provide greater ease of use  lifestyle improvement or beneficial effects on medical outcomes over the course of treatment  the company may not be successful in capturing a significant share of the market 
in addition  many of the company s competitors offer broader product lines than the company  which may be a competitive advantage in obtaining contracts with healthcare purchasing groups  and may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain contracts with such purchasing groups 
additionally  many of the company s competitors have substantially more marketing and sales experience than the company and substantially greater resources to devote to such efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against such competitors 
urinary continence care can be managed with a variety of alternative medical treatments and management products or techniques  including adult diapers and absorbent pads  surgery  behavior therapy  pelvic muscle exercise  implantable devices  injectable materials and other medical devices 
manufacturers of these products or techniques are engaged in research to develop more advanced versions of current products and techniques 
many of the companies that are engaged in such development work have substantially greater capital resources than the company and greater expertise than the company in research  development and regulatory matters 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be able to compete with existing or future alternative products  techniques or therapies  or that advancements in existing products  techniques or therapies will not render the company s products obsolete 
possible need for additional capital although the company believes its existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its capital needs for approximately the next two years  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing before that time 
the company s actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of the company s existing and new products  including the release nf catheter and femsoft insert  changes in  termination of  and the success of  existing and new distribution arrangements  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments relating to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of the company s research and development efforts  and other factors 
in the event that additional financing is needed  the company may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborate relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
effects of government regulation the company s products  product development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for such products 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance for new medical products from the fda can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearance will be granted timely  if at all  for the company s products in development  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or to expand permitted uses of existing products 
even if regulatory clearance to market a product is obtained from the fda  this clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
marketing clearance can also be withdrawn by the fda due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance 
the company may be required to make further filings with the fda under certain circumstances  such as the addition of product claims or product reformulation 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretation made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  which may have retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the fda and various state agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations relating to medical device manufacturing companies  including regulations concerning design  manufacturing  testing  quality control and product labeling practices 
a determination that the company is in material violation of such regulations could lead to the imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls  product seizures  or  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
a portion of the company s revenues are dependent upon sales of its products outside the united states 
foreign regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the company relies on its third party foreign distributors to comply with certain foreign regulatory requirements 
the inability or failure of the company or such foreign distributors to comply with varying foreign regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the sale of the company s products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights the company s success may depend in part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and manufacturing processes  to preserve its trade secrets  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
no assurance can be given that the scope of any patent protection under the company s current patents  or under any patent the company might obtain in the future  will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology  current or future products or activities will not be deemed to infringe upon the rights of others 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products or manufacturing processes  duplicate any of the company s products or manufacturing processes  or design around the company s patents 
the company also relies upon unpatented trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology or disclose such technology or that the company can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
the medical device industry is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation  particularly with respect to newly developed technology 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel 
as a result  a claim by a third party that the company s current products or products in development allegedly infringe its patent rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  an adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from such parties  if licenses to such rights could be obtained  and or require the company to cease using such technology 
if third party patents containing claims affecting the company s technology were issued and such claims were determined to be valid  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain licenses to such patents at costs reasonable to the company  if at all  or be able to develop or obtain alternate technology 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing  using or selling certain of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possibility of product liability litigation  possible inadequacy of insurance the medical products industry is subject to substantial product liability litigation  and the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects to a patient 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company  including on market acceptance of its products 
the company maintains general insurance policies that include coverage for product liability claims 
the policies are limited to an aggregate maximum of million per product liability claim  with an annual aggregate limit of million under the policies 
the company may require increased product liability coverage as new products are developed and commercialized 
there can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limits of the company s policies or that adequate insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
a product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investments generally consist of debt securities with contractual maturities of one year or less 
therefore  the company does not believe its operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature
