item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company participates in five reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
the first segment is the north american residential market  in which lii manufactures and markets a full line of heating  air conditioning and hearth products for the residential replacement and new construction markets in the united states and canada 
the second segment is the north american retail market which includes sales and installation of  and maintenance and repair services for  hvacr equipment by lii owned service centers in the united states and canada 
the third segment is the global commercial air conditioning market  in which lii manufactures and sells rooftop products and applied systems for commercial applications 
the fourth segment is the global commercial refrigeration market  which consists of unit coolers  condensing units and other commercial refrigeration products 
the fifth segment is the heat transfer market  in which lii designs  manufactures and sells evaporator and condenser coils  copper tubing and related manufacturing equipment to original equipment manufacturers and other specialty purchasers on a global basis 
lii sells its products to numerous types of customers  including distributors  installing dealers  property owners  national accounts and original equipment manufacturers 
the demand for lii s products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction and general economic conditions  especially consumer confidence 
in addition to economic cycles  demand for lii s products is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
hotter than normal summers generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and colder than normal winters have the same effect on heating products 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress sales of hvacr products 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead and estimated costs of warranty expense 
the principal raw materials used in lii s manufacturing processes are copper  aluminum and steel 
in instances where lii is unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of copper and aluminum  lii enters into forward contracts for the purchase of those materials 
lii attempts to minimize the risk of price fluctuations in key components by entering into contracts  typically at the beginning of the year  which generally provide for fixed prices for its needs throughout the year 
these hedging strategies enable lii to establish product prices for the entire model year while minimizing the impact of price increases of components and raw materials on its margins 
warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends and other factors 
lii acquired james n 
kirby pty 
ltd 
kirby  an australian company that participates in the commercial refrigeration and heat transfer markets in australia  in june for approximately million in cash  common stock and seller financing  plus a contingent consideraton based on the future value of lii stock 
in addition  lii assumed approximately million of kirby s debt 
lii purchased the hvac related assets of the ducane company  inc in october for approximately million in cash 
this purchase added to the brands offered in the north american residential segment 
on january   lii completed the acquisition of service experts inc  an hvac company comprised of hvac retail businesses across the united states  for approximately million  including million shares of lii common stock and the assumption of million of debt 
the acquisition added an additional service centers to the us retail network 
as these centers have been integrated into the retail operation with the centers acquired by lii since september   operating performance has not reached expected levels 
during the second quarter of  the company initiated a restructuring plan which covered selling  closing or merging company owned dealer service centers 
during the fourth quarter of  a new president and chief operating officer was appointed and management was significantly restructured to further improve operating efficiency and the company s competitive position in the market 
the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges in totaling million 
these restructuring charges related to closures of manufacturing plants in toronto  ontario  canada and brookvale  nsw  australia scheduled to occur in the first quarter of charges were also recorded for closing and consolidating a distribution facility in the us  for office consolidation of the company s corporate headquarters  for elimination of excess manufacturing capacity in europe and for final close down costs for its mexico sales operation  as they exceeded original estimates 
these restructuring charges also included the closure of certain retail centers in the third quarter of and the merger of certain other retail centers in and these charges are discussed further in the results of operations below 
lii s fiscal year ends on december of each year and its fiscal quarters are each comprised of weeks 
for convenience  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the calendar quarter

the balance of the sales decrease is a result of the closure of retail centers and soft economic conditions 
net sales in the north american residential segment were  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from  million for the year ended december  a weaker economic climate in  which accelerated after the events of september  resulted in a drop in discretionary spending by consumers  who continue to defer investment in new heating and cooling equipment 
as a result  replacements or upgrades of existing home comfort systems were often deferred 
net sales in the north american retail segment were  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from  million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to dealer service centers that were sold or closed during and by the economic issues previously mentioned in the north american residential segment 
on a same store basis  sales were up when adjusted for service centers that were sold or closed 
commercial air conditioning net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the sales increase was after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange 
although market conditions continued to soften in the fourth quarter of  we continue to see market share growth as a result of strong performance from national accounts and commercial sales districts 
europe experienced double digit commercial air conditioning sales growth over the prior year after adjusting for foreign currency exchange movements 
the benefits of increased distribution  decreased product costs and improved customer service through a unified european marketing strategy are being realized 
net sales related to the commercial refrigeration segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  over two thirds of the sales decline is a result of foreign currency exchange 
even though the north american refrigeration market in which we participate is estimated to be approximately below year levels  market share gains have been made through targeted account efforts and customer service levels provided 
heat transfer segment revenues declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  compared to the same period last year  sales declined after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange 
the heat transfer segment is the segment most affected by the economic downturn 
heat transfer products are sold to customers in the recreational vehicle  telecommunications  transport refrigeration and automotive industries 
these industries have been impacted by the economic downturn to a greater degree than the general business community 
gross profit gross profit was million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
gross profit margin was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  over of the decrease in gross profit margin was in the retail segment 
inefficient labor utilization and a shift in product mix to lower margin new construction sales were the reasons for the retail segment margin decline 
the remaining of the decline in gross profit margin was primarily a result of increased manufacturing overhead and product mix changes including a higher ratio of lower margin parts and supplies 
a new manufacturing facility in orangeburg  south carolina  and the relocation of product lines from the manufacturing facility in bellevue  ohio to the orangeburg facility were the principal reasons for the higher manufacturing overhead 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues for the twelve months of and  respectively 
nearly one month s additional expense approximately million was incurred in as a result of the acquisition of service experts inc  completed on january  similarly  an additional million in expense resulted from a full twelve months of the accounts receivable securitization program 
selling  general and administrative expense incurred for accounts receivable securitization is more than offset by reduced interest expense 
cost reduction programs  expense control initiatives and reductions in personnel  primarily in the retail and heat transfer segments  helped offset the increases from the service experts inc acquisition and asset securitization program 
restructurings the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges in totaling million 
these charges are shown as part of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the restructuring charges are related to closures of manufacturing plants in toronto  ontario  canada and brookvale  nsw  australia which are scheduled to occur in the first quarter of charges were also recorded for closing and consolidating a distribution facility in the us for office consolidation of the company s corporate headquarters  for elimination of excess manufacturing capacity in europe and for final close down costs for its mexico sales operation  as they exceeded original estimates 
these restructuring charges also included the closure of certain retail centers in the third quarter of and the merger of certain other retail centers in and the restructuring charges are summarized as follows in thousands asset december  nd quarter write downs  net payments adjustments reserve balance severance and benefits   asset write downs    contract exit costs   total    asset december  th quarter write downs  net payments adjustments reserve balance severance and benefits  asset write downs   contract exit costs  total   severance and benefits includes amounts paid to  or anticipated to be paid to  salaried and hourly employees that were either terminated or notified of impending termination as of december  interest expense  net interest expense  net  for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decreased interest expense was a result of decreased debt levels and lower interest rates 
at the end of each quarter of  total debt levels have been much lower than the comparable quarter of strong cash flow generation has allowed significant progress in paying down debt 
at the end of december  total debt was million  million lower than december  other other expense was million for the year ended december   a million decline from the same period a year ago 
other expense is primarily comprised of currency exchange gains or losses  which relate principally to the company s operations in canada  australia  europe and brazil 
improvement in canada s currency exchange movement was primarily responsible for the overall improvement over prior year 
provision for income taxes the benefit from income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  excluding the tax benefit of million as a result of the restructuring charges recognized in  the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the same period last year 
this rate differs from the statutory federal rate of principally due to state and local taxes  non deductible goodwill expenses  foreign operating losses for which no tax benefits have been recognized and foreign taxes at rates other than

the acquisition of ducane s hvac product lines was the primary reason for the acquisition sales increase 
lii s traditional north american residential businesses had a decrease in sales of million  or  from the prior year 
this decrease was a result of unfavorable weather and a decline in sales in the company s hearth products business 
mild weather conditions in key markets for lii negatively impacted sales in both the early months of and especially the third quarter of over of the company s north american residential equipment sales are concentrated in geographic locations that had a cold summer in cooling degree days through august of were below levels in the northeast region of the united states and below levels in the upper midwest region of the united states 
this unusually cool summer reduced the stress on existing air conditioning equipment  which depressed equipment sales and reduced demand for profitable add on air conditioning in those markets where air conditioning is a discretionary purchase 
the company s hearth products business sales decreased as a result of declining housing starts and a delay in realizing synergies from the individual hearth operations acquired primarily in the third quarter of and first quarter of net sales in the north american retail segment were  million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  this increase was almost entirely due to acquisitions 
commercial air conditioning net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  north american sales grew over the prior year 
this growth is primarily a result of two additional commercial sales districts and the introduction of the company s cost effective value line product 
international commercial air conditioning sales also grew over the prior year  when compared in local currencies 
converted to us dollars  however  the increase was negated  primarily due to the decrease in the euro exchange rate from the prior year 
net sales related to the commercial refrigeration segment were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to the acquisition of james n 
kirby pty 
ltd 
north american commercial refrigeration sales increased due to strong sales in the walk in cooler segment and some large cold storage projects that were completed

excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions  international sales grew

market risk lii s results of operations can be affected by changes in exchange rates 
net sales and expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar are translated into united states dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period 
during  and  net sales from outside the united states represented  and  respectively  of total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on lii s overall operations 
lii from time to time enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge receivables or payables denominated in foreign currencies

accordingly  million  net of applicable income tax  has been charged to other comprehensive income loss

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how the company develops its judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires the most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
the company identified the most critical accounting policies to be estimation of warranty liabilities  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  and adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page product warranties a liability for estimated warranty expense is established by a charge against operations at the time products are sold 
the subsequent costs incurred for warranty claims serve to reduce the product warranty liability 
the company recorded warranty expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s estimate of future warranty costs is determined for each product line 
the number of units that are expected to be repaired or replaced is determined by applying the estimated failure rate  which is generally based on historical experience  to the number of units that have been sold and are still under warranty 
the estimated units to be repaired under warranty are multiplied by the average cost undiscounted to repair or replace such products to determine the company s estimated future warranty cost 
the company s estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience 
total liabilities for estimated warranty expense are million and million as of december  and  respectively  and are included in the following captions on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in thousands december  accrued expenses   other liabilities   goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have been recorded based on their fair value at the date of acquisition and are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods generally ranging from thirty to forty years 
as of december  and  accumulated amortization was million and million  respectively 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in order to assess recoverability  the company compares the estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges identified with each long lived asset or related asset grouping to the carrying amount of such assets 
for purposes of such comparisons  portions of goodwill are attributed to related long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets based upon relative fair values of such assets at acquisition 
if the expected future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset or assets being reviewed  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over their fair value 
as a result of these periodic reviews  there have been no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles  or goodwill in and certain assets  including goodwill  of an australian subsidiary were adjusted in allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is generally established during the period in which receivables are recognized and is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
such factors include the historical trends of write offs and recovery of previously written off accounts  the financial strength of the customer and projected economic and market conditions 
the evaluation of these factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
thus  changes in these factors may significantly impact the consolidated financial statements 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in additional changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
becomes effective for the company on january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life no longer be amortized as expenses of operations  but rather carried on the balance sheet as permanent assets 
these intangible assets are to be subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets amounted to million million on an after tax basis for these expense amounts  under sfas no 
 will not be recorded in years after the company is currently evaluating the fair value of its operations in which goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles have been recorded 
this evaluation is being conducted in consultation with independent valuation advisors 
the preliminary indications are that the company will record an impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of this charge is estimated to range from million to million  subject to independent auditors review 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas becomes effective for the company on january  sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement supersedes sfas  however  this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations
