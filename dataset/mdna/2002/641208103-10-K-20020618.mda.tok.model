product revenue decreases for both and are the result of a general decline in the overall market for circuit switched products 
product revenue was also impacted in by the end of life for our sonet transmission manager  or stm  product line  which accounted for million in revenue in fiscal and no revenue in fiscal the decline was partially offset by revenue growth in our federal business  fueled by increased page government defense spending and homeland security initiatives after the events of september  we have developed new service creation products for the broadband equipment market that are intended to offset the decline in product revenue of our promina product line 
although broadband product revenue in fiscal was not significant  we expect this revenue to increase in fiscal product revenue for the north america sales channel decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal product revenue for the north america sales channel decreased to million in fiscal product revenue for the asia pacific latin america sales channel decreased to million compared to million in fiscal fiscal product revenue for the asia pacific latin america sales channel decreased from million in fiscal product revenue for the european sales channel decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal product revenue for the european sales channel decreased compared to the million in fiscal product revenue for the federal government sales channel  which includes sales to the federal government and federal government contractors  increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal product revenue for the federal government sales channel in fiscal decreased compared to million in fiscal service and other revenue decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal fiscal service and other revenue decreased compared to the million in fiscal the decrease in service and other revenue is primarily the result of the following the sale of our fsb to caci in the third quarter of fiscal  which accounted for million of the decrease in fiscal the fsb revenue in fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
a decline in the installed base of promina equipment that requires on going service support 
as part of our broadband strategy  we developed new service creation solutions that we expect will expand our service offerings in the new fiscal year and offset part of the service and other revenue decline in fiscal although we expect incremental service and other revenue from the broadband offerings  we believe service and other revenue will remain relatively flat in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as a result of a decline in the installed base of promina equipment 
gross margin total gross margin  comprised of product and service margin  decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in total gross margin is primarily the result of the following lower product margins 
product gross margin decreased to of revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to the write off of inventory due to excess and obsolescence 
additionally in fiscal  a charge of million was taken in connection with the end of life and subsequent obsolescence of the stm and the router accelerator product lines 
also in fiscal and  the margins were impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances resulting from lower revenues 
lower service revenues 
services and other revenue gross margin decreased to of revenue in fiscal  from in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in service and other revenue gross margin in fiscal and is primarily from lower services contract revenues resulting from the sale of the fsb to caci in the third quarter of fiscal there are a significant amount of services cost that are fixed  and thus the lower revenue has impacted and will continue to impact margins 
gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings  increased price competition  geographic mix and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced  gross margin may also be adversely affected 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is primarily a result of lower revenue 
in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we completed two separate restructurings that included a reduction in our workforce 
these reductions contributed to lower operating expenses in fiscal and in addition  two other smaller restructurings that included reductions in our workforce were completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the restructure expense in fiscal was a charge of million compared to a credit of million in page fiscal and a charge of million in fiscal the credit in fiscal resulted from lower costs than initially estimated related to the closure of field offices 
in fiscal lower expenses also resulted from tightly managed expenses throughout net 
com 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing spending as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal and increased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal spending  compared to  resulted from a decrease in salary and related costs of million  a decrease of  in travel expenses  a decrease in depreciation costs of million  and million in lower sales and marketing related costs consistent with decreased revenue 
the decrease in fiscal over resulted primarily from a decrease in salary and related costs of million  a decrease in travel expenses of million and a decrease in facility and information systems expenses of million 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development spending as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal spending  compared to  resulted from a decrease in salary related expenses of million  a decrease in depreciation costs of million and million in lower engineering related expenses 
in fiscal and  we focused research and development resources on the development and release of our broadband and voice over ip product offerings 
the decrease in fiscal over resulted primarily from a decrease in depreciation of  and a decrease in facility and information systems expenses of million these were offset by a decrease in the amount capitalized for software development of million and an increase in material expenses of million 
in the coming fiscal year  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease as a result of headcount reductions made in fiscal  however  expenses may fluctuate on a quarterly basis to coincide with the introduction of new products 
general and administrative expense in fiscal decreased  to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative spending as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative spending in fiscal spending  compared to  was the result of decreased salary and related employee expenses of million offset by an increase of  in information technology related expenses 
the decrease in fiscal over resulted primarily from a decrease in salary related expenses of million 
we expect general and administrative spending to decline slightly due to continued focus on cost control 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and  in fiscal the amortization is a result of two acquisitions  flowwise in the third quarter of fiscal and convergence equipment company in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill and other intangibles have been amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
a charge of  was recorded in fiscal for purchased in process technology that arose from the acquisition of flowwise 
beginning fiscal  we will adopt statement of financial and accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in compliance with sfas no 
 we are planning for the following accounting related to goodwill and intangibles for fiscal beginning march  there will be no charges for the amortization of goodwill in fiscal or thereafter 
the net book value of goodwill of million will be reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there is indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired 
any resulting impairment will be recorded in the income statement in the period it is identified and quantified 
we will also be required to perform a transition impairment analysis 
we are currently in the process of completing the transitional impairment analysis  which we expect to be completed in the second quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact to our financial statements 
non operating items interest income  primarily related to cash investments  decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of decreased yields and lower cash balances of our investment portfolio in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of higher yields from our investment portfolio 
we believe interest income in fiscal will decrease as a result of the continued use of our cash to fund operations and lower interest rates 
interest expense from the convertible subordinated debentures and the debt obligations assumed by net 
com as part of the acquisition of flowwise remained constant fiscal over fiscal at million each year and page decreased compared to fiscal at million 
the decrease from fiscal was primarily related to the reduction in principal for the debt obligations 
other income in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain of million from insurance proceeds received for construction costs associated with our new fremont campus and a gain of million from the caci agreement for the divestiture of the fsb 
we expect further gains in fiscal related to these two items 
other income in fiscal included a gain of million from the sale of the fsb 
other income in fiscal includes a gain of million  principally from the sale of all of the equity securities held in a publicly traded company 
fiscal included a tax benefit of million  as compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal and a tax provision of million in fiscal each year  we evaluate the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns as well as our expected net losses 
the result of this reevaluation was to reduce the amount of necessary reserves and to record a tax benefit of million in fiscal and million in fiscal significant accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  generally upon shipment  when all four of the following criteria are met we have a contract with our customer  when delivery has occurred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when our price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for transactions where we have not yet obtained customer acceptance  revenue is generally deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation or other services is recognized upon completion of the service 
maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the contract  which is typically one quarter 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory provisions inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to make lower of cost or market adjustments and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals we accrue for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
deferred taxes we have incurred tax losses in the last four fiscal years and  at march   we have an estimated million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state operating loss page carryforwards available to reduce tax payments in future periods 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our tax assets  given the uncertainty as to their realization 
in future years  these benefits are available to reduce or eliminate taxes on future taxable income 
in addition  if we were to be acquired by a third party  these tax losses could be a significant factor in their valuation of us should they be available to reduce future tax liabilities for the acquiring company 
impairment of intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for this asset 
on march   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended march   we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million and short term investments of million for a total of million as compared to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal the fiscal reduction was a result of cash used to fund operations  as well as million used to build our new fremont campus 
the increase of million in cash in fiscal over resulted primarily from the sale of the fsb and insurance proceeds  both of which is discussed below 
net cash used for operations was million in fiscal  compared to million used in the prior year 
this compares to net cash used by operations of million in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
offsetting these were a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  and a decrease in prepaid assets of million 
additional offsets were depreciation and amortization of million  a gain recognized from proceeds relating to the sale of our fsb of million  a gain recognized of million from the insurance settlement relating to our new fremont campus  and cash proceeds from the insurance settlement of million 
the decrease in resulted primarily from a net loss of million  an adjustment for the sale of the fsb of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
partially offsetting the reductions was the adjustment for depreciation and amortization of million and the million in cash received from insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of construction defects at our fremont campus 
pursuant to our settlement agreement  we will be eligible to receive additional insurance proceeds as a function of costs incurred for moving and replacement of tenant improvements 
net cash provided by investment activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cash provided by investment activities was primarily from maturing temporary investments  net of new purchases  of million and million received from the sale of our fsb 
offsetting these were million of cash used for the purchases of fixed assets  most of which were leasehold improvements on our new fremont campus 
this compares to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal net cash provided by investment activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the proceeds from maturing temporary cash investments of million  million cash received from the sale of the fsb and a decrease in restricted cash of million mostly due to our closing our line of credit 
net cash used for investing activities was million in purchases of temporary cash investments and the net use of million cash for the purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this compares to net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock  which was partially offset by the use of million in cash for the repurchase of common stock 
we believe that our existing current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  purchases of capital equipment and research and development programs currently planned at least through the next months 
page business environment and risk factors our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described below 
although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business  this is not an all inclusive list 
there may be additional risks not described because either they have not yet been identified or they are not material now  although they could arise or become material in the future 
any one of the risks identified below could materially impact our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have incurred net losses in the past and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
for each of the past four fiscal years  we have incurred net losses 
our ability to achieve profitability on a continuing basis will depend upon the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our new products  specifically our scream product line and our shoutip product line 
we expect to continue to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses as we continue to maintain support of our existing products and customers while launching new products 
many of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly 
at current revenue levels  our operating expenses continue to be too high to enable us to be profitable 
in order to achieve profitability  we need to generate significant sales growth from our scream and shoutip product lines or decrease expenses 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate 
our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are the result of a number of factors  including o the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to our customers  o the length and variability of the sales cycle of our products  o the timing of and our ability to obtain new customer contracts  o the timing of new products and services  o the timing and level of prototype expenses  o the availability of products and services  o the overall capital expenditures of our customers  o the market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services or variations in the mix of products and services we sell  o the availability and cost of key components  o the timing of revenue recognition deferrals  o the adoption of new accounting standards  o the obsolescence of inventories  o the timing and size of federal government budget approvals  and o general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications  internet and related industries 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
any shortfall in revenue may impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
you should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
page our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts  and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies  in particular technology companies  and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic  industry specific  and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
our success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance 
our operating results will depend to a significant extent on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our new broadband equipment products  specifically our scream product line and to a lesser extent on our shoutip product line 
the success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  competitive product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
our scream and shoutip product lines target start up telecommunications companies and long established domestic carriers such as at t  bellsouth  qwest  sbc communications  sprint  verizon  and worldcom 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
products and technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive which in turn could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
we are dependent on revenue from the promina product line until revenue from our scream and shoutip product lines increases substantially 
currently  we derive the majority of our product revenue from our promina product line  a circuit based technology 
we believe that the market for circuit based technology has declined and will continue to decline in the future as new networks will likely employ packet based technology 
the migration from circuit to packet based technology has happened more dramatically in the united states commercial markets than in the federal government market and the rest of the world 
the decline of our business in the united states commercial markets since fiscal continues to have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
should this decline extend into our international and federal government markets in a similar fashion before we gain traction on our new scream and shoutip product lines  our revenue may not increase to profitable levels 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to the federal government 
a significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with the federal government  most of which do not include long term purchase commitments 
historically  the federal government has been slower to adopt new technology  such as packet based technology  which has had the effect of extending the product life of our older products 
if the federal government accelerated adoption of new technology by replacing the promina product line in their networks with products other than ours  our product revenue would decline sharply 
we anticipate that our past experience will result in future contracts with the federal government  however  we face significant competition in this endeavor 
if we fail in renewing a significant number of federal government contracts or if sales to the federal government decline sharply  our revenue may not increase to profitable levels 
page our ability to successfully commercialize scream will depend heavily on the widespread acceptance of service creation as a means of achieving maximum network productivity and on appropriate regulatory incentives 
over the last five years  carriers generated revenue by adding more customers or by offering additional services to existing customers 
offering additional services to an existing subscriber base is generally a preferred approach to generating additional revenue  but these services typically require network upgrades and the purchase of expensive equipment 
over time  however  carriers aggressive price discounts  expensive direct marketing campaigns  and massive capital outlays for infrastructure expansion have offset whatever incremental revenue increases were generated by the new services and have eroded the profitability of these companies 
since the second quarter of fiscal  we have spent the majority of our research and development and marketing resources to position ourselves and our scream family of products as the next generation of telecommunications equipment that will enable carriers to maximize the delivery of new services while leveraging their existing networks and ensuring quality of service 
the future success of the scream product will depend in large measure on carriers acceptance of service creation as the vehicle that will deliver revenue increases sought after by them 
failure to achieve this acceptance could affect our ability to sell the scream product and grow overall revenue 
in addition  without deregulation in the united states and overseas  the economic incentive for the incumbent carrier to actively engage in changing their service delivery model to the service creation delivery model is low 
while the decision by the fcc to decline to force incumbent local exchange carriers to unbundle their atm infrastructure  thus allowing incumbents to deny competitive carriers access to their atm networks  has made the service creation model viable for carrier revenue growth  it remains to be seen whether or not the regulatory structure in other countries will set the stage for the service creation model to take hold 
failure to achieve the regulatory structure favorable to the service creation model overseas could affect our ability to sell the scream product overseas and to grow overall revenue 
to successfully market our products  we will need to sign up significant new strategic partners who can help sell our products into the service provider market 
in order to successfully market our products  we will need to sign up new strategic partners  such as software application partners  systems integrators and product oem  or resellers 
the importance of the software application partners is that they provide critical functions  such as billing  mediation  provisioning and configuration that are needed to create a total service creation solution for our customers 
product oem or resale partners will be needed to supplement and enhance our existing direct sales force both in the united states and overseas 
service providers rely on systems integrators to support new equipment or services into their network 
these integrators are important in the large incumbent carrier networks and could facilitate our entry into those networks 
while we have begun the process of identifying and signing software application  system integrator and oem or resale partners  more partners may be necessary in all these areas for us to be successful 
in particular  we may need to find strategic partners to assist us with the integration of security functions  such as digital certificates  third party firewall  intrusion detection and public key management to meet evolving security needs  as well as to counter rival efforts to assert differentiation in the security area 
additionally  we may need to pursue partnerships with vendors who have optical core and core routing technologies in order to counter the end to end solution providers  such as alcatel  cisco  juniper  lucent  nortel  and siemens  as well as to bolster our co marketing efforts 
failure to sign up these new strategic partners could affect our ability to grow overall revenue 
recent declines in purchases by telecommunications service providers and the overall decline of product sales in this market could impact sales over the next several quarters 
over the last twenty four months  the financial health of many of the newly emerging telecommunications service providers  including many of the companies classified as clecs began to deteriorate 
in addition  the more established service providers have cut back on equipment purchases as part of an overall slow down in economic growth 
we believe that many telecommunications equipment companies  including net 
com  are impacted by this decline 
in addition  the timing and volume of purchases by emerging service providers can be unpredictable due to other factors  including their need to build a customer base and to expand their capacity while working within their budgetary constraints 
our ability to recognize revenue from emerging service providers will depend on the relative financial strength of the particular customer 
we may be required to write off or decrease the value of our accounts receivable from a customer whose financial condition materially deteriorates 
decreases in purchasing volume of page emerging service providers or changes in the financial condition of emerging service provider customers could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 
in addition  the selling cycle of our scream and shoutip product families could be extended as our service provider customers reduce their capital budgets 
gross margins could decline over future periods 
due to increases in competition  material and labor costs  subcontractor costs and changes in the mix of products we sell  we expect that our gross margins could decline in future quarters 
the new products we introduced recently have lower gross margins than our promina product line 
in addition  if product sales decrease as a percentage of total revenue  overall margins may decrease because service revenue has a lower margin than product sales 
in addition  to the extent we expand our sales through product resellers and strategic partnerships  we expect to earn lower gross margins 
factors beyond our control could affect our ability to sell into international markets 
as a general rule  international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for  including political and economic stability  regulatory changes  currency exchange rates  changes in tax rates and structures  and collection of accounts receivable 
further  our international markets are served primarily by non exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely impacted by economic or market changes within a particular country or region 
unforeseen or unpredictable changes in international markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the divestiture of our federal services business may not be successful 
on december   we closed the sale of our fsb to caci  which will continue to provide maintenance and other services to our federal government customers 
we continue to sell net 
com products directly to the federal government and  additionally  have a strategic alliance with the acquirer  caci  to jointly market each other s products and services 
for the divestiture to be successful  caci must continue to provide the level of service to which our customers have become accustomed 
should caci experience difficulties in providing those services  it could impact purchasing decisions for our product and cause customers to seek products from other vendors 
increased competition is likely in the future 
the market for telecommunication equipment is highly competitive  dynamic and characterized by the easy entrance of new start up companies  rapid changes to and the convergence of technologies  and a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet based technologies 
we compete directly internationally and domestically with many different companies  some of which are large  established suppliers of end to end solutions  such as alcatel  cisco  juniper  lucent  nortel  and siemens 
in addition  there are a number of new start ups that are targeting this market  including celox  clarent  cosine  ellacoya  gotham  nuera  quarry  unisphere  and others 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer 
they are often able to devote greater resources to the development  marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and or products that compete directly with ours 
they often can compete favorably on price because their large product selection allows them to bundle multiple solutions together without significantly impacting their overall product margins 
small start up ventures have more ability than net 
com to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line 
as a result of the flexibility of their market strategies  our competitors may be able to obtain strategic advantages that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions 
this has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment 
moreover  broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers 
it is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and technologies we have in development or will require us to significantly lower page our prices in order to remain competitive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to evolve our scream and shoutip product lines to meet the ever changing technology needs of the networking market while ensuring that they can be sold at a competitive price 
we also must enhance our promina product line to provide needed features that increase their overall value proposition for the customer while keeping the price competitive 
due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our promina product offerings as well as the competitive pressure being exerted on our scream and shoutip technologies  we may not be able to maintain prices for them at levels that will sustain profitability over the short or long term 
our inability to sign competitive resale partners internationally could significantly affect future product and service revenue 
because the transition from circuit to packet technology is slower outside the united states  we expect international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our promina product sales other than that sold in the federal channel in future periods 
our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide 
they do not have minimum purchase requirements that they must meet 
while we require them to use their best efforts to resell our products  because our product line is small  our distributors and resellers must often resell product lines from other networking companies  including our competitors  such as cisco  in order to sustain a profit 
because of the size of cisco and its dominant position in the network equipment market  it is difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who does not resell cisco products 
because our distributors and resellers often have pre existing competitive relationships  our distributors and resellers are not always successful in promoting our products thereby impacting the sustainability of our international product sales 
if we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services  we may not be able to meet our forecasted revenue in future quarters 
our products have long sales cycles  making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale 
our products are very complex pieces of networking equipment and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers 
the purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer 
consequently  our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase 
there are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle can be quite long  up to a year in some cases 
in addition  our customers  including resellers  have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty 
the ability to delay or cancel orders makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may actually ship 
moreover  while customers may tell us that they are planning to purchase our products  to ensure a purchase order is placed  we often must incur substantial sales and marketing expense 
if the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted because approvals took longer than anticipated by the customer  our sales may not meet forecast and revenues may continue to be insufficient to meet expenses 
our lack of backlogged product orders makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and creates a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory 
historically  the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter 
while we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels  our customers ordering patterns and the absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
rather than base forecasts on orders received  we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales  which are difficult to predict in the telecommunications industry 
furthermore  if large orders do not close when forecasted or if near term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship  our operating results for that quarter or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected 
page if we are unable to retain existing employees and attract  recruit and retain key personnel  then we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
our success continues to be dependent on our being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers  managers and other key employees 
if there is a sharp upturn in the economy  especially in the telecommunications industry  we may not be able to continue to attract  recruit and retain key personnel  particularly engineers and sales and marketing employees  we may be unable to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets 
we rely on a number of sole source suppliers for our component parts 
we purchase key components from single source suppliers  in particular  our back planes  asics and power supplies 
if our sole source suppliers or we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed resulting in decreased revenues 
in addition  if one of these suppliers were no longer able to supply a required component  we may have to significantly reengineer the affected product 
further  variability in demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry have caused lead times for ordering parts to increase from time to time 
if we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements  we may be unable to ship ordered products in a timely manner 
we single source our manufacturing process  a failure or delay by that vendor could impact our ability to ship our products timely 
we currently subcontract some testing and all product manufacturing to one company  solectron 
final test and assembly is generally performed at our fremont  california facility 
while subcontracting creates substantial cost efficiencies in the manufacturing process  it also exposes us to delays in product shipments should solectron be unable to perform under our contract 
in addition  should solectron in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them  it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements to another vendor  likely causing substantial delays in customer product shipments and impacting revenue and our results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business 
our future success depends upon our proprietary technology 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  and trade secrets  we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate  or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights 
as competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap  we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
we have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights 
we cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third party claims  or that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms 
any of these claims  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time  attention and resources  delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non infringing technology  we may be unable to market the affected product 
we need to continue to license products from third parties 
for our promina  scream and shoutip products  we license some of our technology from third parties 
if the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license on commercially reasonable terms  or if we cannot obtain a license for our new and legacy products or enhancements on our existing products we may be unable to market the affected product 
page we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulations and tariffs 
changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could affect the sales of our products 
in the united states  our products must comply with various fcc requirements and regulations 
in countries outside of the united states  our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities 
changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could impact our ability to market the affected product 
in addition  there are currently few laws or regulations that govern access or commerce on the internet 
if individual countries  or groups of countries  acting in concert  began to impose regulations or standards on internet access or commerce including voice over ip  our ability to sell our new scream and shoutip products or other new products would be adversely impacted if the regulations or standards resulted in decreased demand or increased costs for our products 
in north america  the former rbocs require that equipment be certified by telcordia under their osmine program in order to ensure interoperability with other network elements and operational support systems 
this is a very expensive and lengthy process 
we have initiated plans to become osmine certified 
any delays or problems with attaining this certification could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures have been related to non dollar denominated sales in the united kingdom  france  and germany and non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  latin america  and asia where we sell primarily in united states dollars 
the use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could impact our foreign exchange exposure 
we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
we are currently not hedging our exposure to the euro or any other foreign currency but will continue to evaluate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our future foreign exchange exposure 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
these facilities are located near the san francisco bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where we have experienced water intrusion problems in the facilities we recently vacated 
in particular  unknown defects in the construction of our new facilities combined with the proximity to water may result in future water infiltration problems for net

a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosure involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
a portion of our investment portfolio is composed of income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease of percent from levels at march  and march  indicated the fair value of the portfolio would change an immaterial amount 
at march   the fair value of the short term investments was million compared to million at march  the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  therefore the interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with interest rates 
at march   the fair value of the trading debt securities was approximately million
