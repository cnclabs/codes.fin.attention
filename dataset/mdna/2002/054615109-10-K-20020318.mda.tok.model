item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations on march   axsys sold the net assets of the beau interconnect division for million in cash and recorded an after tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of beau designed and manufactured interconnect devices  barrier terminal blocks and connectors 
accordingly  beau has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation during and were  and million  respectively 
the net assets of beau at december  have been included in current assets 
on september   we acquired westlake technology corporation 
this acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
accordingly  the results of westlake have been included in axsys consolidated statement of operations since the date of acquisition 
on october   axsys merged with aei 
this merger has been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
accordingly  the full year results of operations of aei have been included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the operating results for aei were not material to the combined results of axsys for all periods prior to  and  therefore  the results for those periods have not been restated

net sales in were million  a decrease of percent  or million  from sales of million in sales of the precision components group were million in compared to million in the percent increase in sales was largely due to improved sales of motion control components and precision machined products to aerospace and defense markets 
aerospace and defense sales increased over the prior year due to a strong backlog of orders gained in the second half of  which were shipped in sales to the electronic capital equipment market and the graphic arts market were lower by percent and percent  respectively in compared to the distributed products group reported sales of million in compared to sales of million in  a decrease of percent or million 
conditions were very weak in the industrial automation and commercial markets for our precision ball bearings  including lower sales to electronics capital equipment markets  which were particularly strong in sales of the automation group were million in compared to million in the million  or percent decrease was due to substantially lower sales of precision measurement and test equipment sold to semiconductor and data storage markets  offset by increased shipments of automation products for photonics applications and other commercial markets 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million in compared to million in included in both periods are restructuring charges see note to the consolidated financial statements related to a reduction in facilities and personnel  as well as charges to inventory obsolescence reserves 
these charges amounted to million in and million in excluding these charges  gross margin as a percent of sales was percent in  compared to percent in margins in were positively impacted by the implementation of a cost reduction plan adopted in the second quarter of cost reduction plan  which reduced manufacturing costs by an estimated thousand

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in  a net decrease of million 
net costs associated with restructuring of operations were million lower in than in as we absorbed million of sg a expenses directly attributable to the cost reduction plan in  compared to expenses of million in related to the strategic realignment of our business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a result of the cost reduction plan was lower overall spending 
a savings of million in was directly attributable to the efforts of this plan 
additionally  incentive payments were lower by million mainly as a result of lower sales volume 
travel expenses were reduced by million in due to the increased usage of videoconferencing equipment 
these favorable savings were partially offset by million of spending for our automation group infrastructure during research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in expenses in the automation group increased by million to million largely related to the development of new product offerings for precision automation applications  primarily for the photonics markets 
net r d spending in the precision components group declined by million in compared to as a result of the cost reduction plan  which reduced r d spending for products targeted at lower growth markets 
restructuring charges 
costs categorized as restructuring charges were million in and million in including severance costs and costs to close certain facilities 
we discuss these costs in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonrecurring merger related charges 
we recorded million of professional fees and expenses related to the merger with aei in the fourth quarter of we expensed these costs according to generally accepted accounting principles for a pooling of interests merger 
operating loss 
we recorded a pre tax operating loss of million in  a decrease of million  from an operating loss of million in the precision components group recorded a profit of million in compared to a loss of million in  as a result of improved sales to the aerospace and defense market and the implementation of lean manufacturing and cost reductions 
the automation group recorded losses of million in a decline of million from a profit of million in despite slight growth in revenues  our increased investment in developing the photonic assembly and test equipment business had a significant impact on earnings 
our distributed products group had a dramatic reduction in sales that resulted in lowering our operating profit from the group to million in from million in non allocated charges for corporate support were million in compared to million in the reduction in corporate overhead is a result of savings from the cost reduction plan offset by increased depreciation and professional fees 
the cost reduction plan resulted in non recurring charges of million compared to million of non recurring charges in from the strategic realignment and the acquisition of automation engineering  inc interest income  net 
net interest income was million in compared to net interest income of million in interest income declined in from the previous year due to lower prevailing interest rates and a lower average investment balance for the year 
in addition  interest income of thousand in compared to thousand was recorded on a note received from the sale of sensor systems 
taxes 
our effective rate for federal and state income taxes was percent in compared to percent in the reduction in the income tax benefit rate was made after a review of our overall business and tax exposures early in discontinued operations 
in march  we sold the beau interconnect division 
results of operations from the discontinued business have been reported separately from continuing operations in all periods presented 
the sale of beau resulted in a gain of million before a tax provision of million 
we also recorded a charge of million  before a tax benefit of million  to increase environmental accruals for the remediation of two former operating sites 
during  our environmental consultants advised us to increase these accruals to better reflect the ongoing costs to complete the remediation of these sites 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of percent  or million  over sales of million in sales of the precision components group were million in compared to million in the percent decrease in sales was caused by a combination of lower sales to aerospace and defense markets offset by improved markets for digital imaging scanners and print engines 
aerospace and defense sales were lower primarily due to relatively weak bookings during mid the recovery in aerospace and defense bookings that began late in and continued throughout resulted in a gradual increase in revenues over the course of  although total year over year sales ended up modestly lower 
sales to worldwide digital imaging markets increased by percent in versus  as product introductions and general market conditions both improved 
the distributed products group reported record sales of million in compared to million in  an increase of percent or million 
business conditions were very strong for precision ball bearings and assemblies sold to industrial automation and electronics capital equipment markets 
sales of the automation group were million in compared to million in the million  or percent increase  was due to internal growth in sales of precision components for semiconductor production and inspection applications and the merger with aei  accounted for as a pooling of interests  which increased sales by million in gross profit 
our gross profit was million in compared to million in as a percent of sales  gross margin was percent in  compared to percent in margins in showed steady improvement over the full year  rising from a low of percent in the first quarter to percent in the fourth quarter 
one time costs recorded in the first quarter related to the strategic realignment reduced gross margins by million as we evaluated slow moving and potentially obsolete inventories 
beginning in the second quarter in  margins increased due to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies  including substantially reduced product returns and warranty claims 
we began the implementation of lean initiatives in when we introduced this program  initially there were incremental costs to reconfigure production processes and train employees 
these costs began to be offset by improvements in throughput and lower scrap rates later in the year 
in addition to benefits from lean  gross margins in the fourth quarter in were unusually high due to a very favorable product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses were million in compared to million in the million increase in includes million of costs directly attributable to the strategic realignment and the one time costs to implement that program 
selling expenses increased by million as we invested in marketing and sales personnel supporting commercial markets 
administrative costs rose by million including million of salaries and expenses to support the initial training and implementation of lean initiatives and a substantial investment in telecommunications infrastructure 
incremental expenses in the automation group were million to support the operations of aei and the fiber automation division 
the balance of the increase in sg a expenses was due to increased salaries  recruiting costs  incentive compensation expenses and legal expenses 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses were million in compared to million in for the first three quarters of the year  a higher allocation of development engineering resources were charged to cost of sales for production programs 
in the fourth quarter alone  r d investment increased by approximately million to million  versus million in the comparable quarter of the change was substantially due to increased expenses in the automation group 
impairment of assets 
late in  we evaluated our strategic direction and long range planning  including the recoverability of long lived assets 
in  axsys recorded a million charge to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to the teletrac acquisition and million to write off a note from westlake technology corporation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges 
costs categorized as restructuring charges were million in including severance costs and costs to close certain facilities 
we discuss these costs in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonrecurring merger related charges 
we recorded million of professional fees and expenses related to the merger with aei in the fourth quarter of we expensed these costs according to generally accepted accounting principles for a pooling of interests merger 
operating loss 
we recorded a pre tax operating loss of million in  an improvement of million  from an operating loss of million in the precision components group recorded a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in  as a result of decreased sales and our investment in lean manufacturing processes 
the automation group recorded profit of million in  a slight increase from a profit of million in as a result of increased revenues and the acquisition of aei 
our distributed products group had a significant increase in sales that resulted in higher operating profits of million in from million in non allocated charges for corporate support were million in compared to million in the increase in corporate overhead is a result of our investment in lean manufacturing and office relocation expenses 
the strategic realignment resulted in non recurring charges of million compared to million of non recurring charges in from the impairment of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of teletrac and the note from westlake technology corporation 
interest income  net 
net interest income was million in compared to net interest expense of million in the proceeds from the divestment of the beau interconnect division in march  after repaying outstanding bank debt and income taxes  provided investment income for most of the year 
in addition  interest income of thousand was recorded on a note received from the sale of sensor systems 
special charge 
in  we recorded a pre tax special charge of million for expenses related to the process of exploring the potential sale of the company 
we discontinued this process during the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
taxes 
our effective rate for federal and state income taxes was percent in compared to percent in in  we reversed million of the tax valuation allowance against the discontinued operations of the beau interconnect division 
as of december   the tax valuation allowance was million 
the decrease in the effective tax benefit rate in was primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill that was carried on the balance sheet related to teletrac and written down in the fourth quarter of discontinued operations 
in march  we sold the beau interconnect division 
results of operations from the discontinued business have been reported separately from continuing operations in all periods presented 
the sale of beau resulted in a gain of million before a tax provision of million 
we also recorded a charge of million  before a tax benefit of million  to increase environmental accruals for the remediation of two former operating sites 
during  our environmental consultants advised us to increase these accruals to better reflect the ongoing costs to complete the remediation of these sites 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources axsys funds its operations primarily from cash flow generated by operations and cash on hand as a result of the divestment of beau in the first quarter of net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in  axsys net loss of million was offset by depreciation and amortization of million as well as working capital changes 
accounts receivable declined by million  reflecting lower fourth quarter sales in compared to  as well as lower days of sales outstanding  which were at days at year end compared to days at the end of inventory levels declined by million  including the effects of inventory write downs taken with the cost reduction plan 
other current assets increased by million  due to a significant tax asset expected to be realized in for net operating losses generated in trade accounts payable declined by million in response to lower production volume and reduced year end capital spending compared to the prior year 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  exclude the non operating gain on the divestment of beau of million 
included in that year s increase in current liabilities are income tax payments of million caused by the beau gain 
excluding income tax payments on the beau gain  cash used in operating activities in was million 
the decrease in cash was largely caused by the million loss from continuing operations  including the effects of restructuring charges recorded and paid through the end of the year 
accounts receivable balances increased due to higher billings at the end of the fourth quarter in this effect was offset by a decrease in inventories and other assets  and the effects of non cash depreciation and amortization charges 
net cash used in or provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  investing activities in were principally related to capital spending of million  which was equal to spending levels in significant investments in were focused on upgrading precision machining capabilities  test and measurement equipment for imaging and motion control products  as well as design and testing equipment for photonics products 
in  the major source of funds was the million in gross proceeds from the divestment of beau in march capital spending in included an investment of million to expand the motion control manufacturing facility as well as investments in telecommunications infrastructure 
net cash used in financing activities was thousand for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in  axsys repaid the outstanding balance of million on borrowings under an million senior secured revolving credit facility in conjunction with the sale of beau on march  the credit facility was subsequently terminated 
as of december   axsys had no significant obligations or commitments for capital expenditures other than those arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  proceeds from a million capital lease facility expiring in september with million of unused capacity remaining at december   and an expected refund of federal income taxes caused by tax net operating losses  will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures  working capital requirements and operations for the next year 
there are no business acquisitions planned as of march  the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years amounts in thousands operating leases capital leases total included are two security deposits in the form of letters of credit for two facility leases which are renewed annually for the term of the lease 
one in the amount of  and relates to the building lease in wilmington  massachusetts 
the other is in the amount of  and relates to the building lease in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
both building leases expire in backlog a substantial portion of our business is of a build to order nature requiring various engineering  manufacturing  testing and other processes to be performed prior to shipment 
as a result  we generally have a significant backlog of orders to be shipped 
our backlog of orders decreased by percent or million  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was caused by lower bookings in each operating segment and shipment of overdue backlog in the precision components group 
the largest decrease was recorded in the digital imaging market  which management believes was driven more by the timing of long term volume purchase agreements than by any fundamental change in the market for our products 
we believe that a substantial portion of our backlog of orders at december  will be shipped over the next twelve months 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions related to inventories and the adequacy of allowances for warranties and doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
two long term contracts are covered by a loss contract reserve 
we accrued for these contracts based on the contract price and the current cost structure 
to the extent future costs to manufacture these products change  our loss contract reserves will be impacted 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our industries are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in several environmental remediation projects 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for clean up is determined and costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
when costs are not probable and reasonably estimable  no accrual is made 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued in august sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  this new standard will have on its reported results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was issued in august sfas no 
is effective in it requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists 
the asset is required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility  and the liability accreted each year based on a present value interest rate 
axsys has not yet evaluated the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its consolidated position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued in june it changes the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill amortization beginning in it will also require at least an annual assessment of goodwill impairment 
the initial test for impairment must be completed by december   but any impairment would be reflected as an accounting change recorded retroactively in the first quarter of the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
goodwill amortization  which amounted to thousand offset by negative amortization of thousand in  will no longer be recorded in  thus increasing earnings  but with no impact on cash flow 
the company has not completed impairment testing and therefore cannot quantify the statement s impact on its consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that some goodwill will be required to be written off in the company s negative goodwill of thousand as of december  will be reversed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of sfas no 
 business combinations  was issued on june  the statement requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase accounting method  eliminating the use of the pooling of interest method 
it also specifies that the purchase price must first be allocated to specific tangible and intangible assets before determination 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company did not use derivative instruments during as a result  the implementation of the statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of the company 
axsys adopted the standard on january  cautionary factors that may affect future results this filing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements regarding our ability to reduce design and manufacturing lead times and manufacturing costs  our ability to integrate existing technologies  our ability to implement our strategy to develop and sell  among other things  higher level subsystems and automation production and test systems  the ability to sell to new customers and markets and to increase the level of value added we provide to customers  the receipt and shipment of orders by axsys  the changes to be achieved from our cost reduction plan  our objective to grow through strategic acquisitions and anticipated expenditures for environmental remediation 
one can identify these forward looking statements by the use of the words such as expect  anticipate  plan  may  will  estimate or other similar expressions 
discussion containing such forward looking statements is found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the filing generally 
one should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include those discussed below as well as inaccurate assumptions 
axsys cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing 
our operating results may vary substantially due to factors that are difficult to forecast 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by axsys or our competitors  domestic and foreign general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the industries that we serve could cause substantial variations in our operating results 
the defense  aerospace  high end digital imaging  electronics capital equipment  semi conductor and photonics markets  each of which represents a significant market for our products  have historically been subject to substantial economic fluctuations due to changing demands for their products and services  introduction of new products and product obsolescence 
any future fluctuations arising from these or other conditions could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products timing and shipment of significant orders mix of products sold length of sales cycles plant openings and closings the timing of acquisitions or dispositions delays in raw materials shipments  as well as other manufacturing delays and disruptions  completion of large projects the level of backlog of orders domestic and foreign general economic conditions  and demand in the markets that we serve 
to some extent  our net sales and operating results for a specific quarter will depend upon generating orders to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated rescheduling or cancellations of shipments by our customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  may cause our net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for such quarter 
the rapid pace of technological change will require continuous new product development 
our success will continue to depend in substantial part upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and to apply appropriate levels of engineering  research and development resources necessary to keep pace with such developments 
in addition  our success will depend on how well we respond to changes in customer requirements and achieve market acceptance for our products and capabilities 
any failure by axsys to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon close relationships with our customers and their willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to such information or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or their enhancements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the new products and services or their enhancements  if any  that we develop  will achieve market acceptance 
our business is concentrated in two major industries that are subject to economic cycles 
a significant portion of our business and business development efforts is concentrated in the defense and  to a lesser extent  electronics capital equipment industries 
our business depends  in significant part  upon the us government s continued demand in the area of defense for high end  high performance components and subsystems of the type that we manufacture 
approximately of our net sales in and of net sales in were derived directly from contracts with the us government  or agencies or departments thereof  or indirectly from subcontracts with us government contractors 
the majority of these government contracts are subject to termination and renegotiation 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in us government expenditures for defense 
additionally  we currently intend to continue to develop the portion of our business dependent upon manufacturers in the electronics capital equipment industry that provide equipment used in the semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display industries 
this business development will depend  in part  upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of electronics capital equipment  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display devices 
the semiconductor  mass data storage and flat panel display industries have been highly volatile and historically have experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
this volatility could have a material adverse effect on our business in the electronics capital equipment industry 
our markets are extremely competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer our products to meet performance specifications set by our customers  most of whom are oems who purchase component parts or subsystems for inclusion in their end products 
product pricing and quality  customer support  experience  reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors 
there are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of precision optical and positioning components and subsystems that we sell 
our competitors  especially those in the precision optical and positioning product lines  are typically focused on a smaller number of product offerings than we are  and they are often well entrenched 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors could develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features to ours 
in addition  new processes or technologies could emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by an existing or potential customer to integrate capital equipment into a production line  or to integrate components and subsystems into their product design 
we believe that once a customer has selected certain capital equipment or certain components or subsystems from a particular vendor  the customer generally relies upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific production line or product application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other capital equipment or component or subsystem requirements 
accordingly  axsys may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to a prospective customer that chooses to utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment or components or subsystems 
further  there are numerous competitors in markets to which we distribute precision ball bearings 
our competitors  who vary in size  include other ball bearings distributors as well as ball bearing manufacturers 
the bases of competition in the industries in which we compete could shift and we may not be able to compete successfully 
sales of our products are dependent on capital spending patterns by our customers  which are cyclical 
our products can range in price from several hundred dollars per component to upwards of one million dollars or more for an integrated system 
these products can represent significant capital expenditures for our customers and are subject to their capital budgeting and approval processes 
our customer s capital budgets may be subject to fluctuations due to general economic conditions domestically and overseas  industry economic cycles and customer specific circumstances 
semiconductor  data storage  and related capital equipment markets can be subjected to sudden and extreme variations in supply and demand for products  including our own 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are developing advanced automation systems for the photonics industry and our products may not achieve broad market acceptance 
our engineered subsystems and automated production and test systems are sold to end users that manufacture fiber optics photonic components 
these production and test systems integrate many of our precision optical and positioning components and subsystems with vision systems  robotics and electronic controls produced by third party companies 
we may not be able to successfully integrate all of these technologies into the advanced systems that we believe that this market will eventually demand 
we also may not be able to accurately assess the requirements of our customers and design effective solutions 
axsys plans to continue to invest in engineering resources and manufacturing capacity for this market 
our ability to recover this investment and the potential demand for our products is largely dependent upon photonics companies deciding to adopt advanced  automated systems 
we have no control over those decisions 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our levels of international sales and purchases could pose risks to our operating results 
our international sales from continuing operations accounted for approximately of net sales in  in  and in in addition  certain of our products are sold to domestic customers who use them in products they sell to international markets 
also  we purchase a substantial portion of our ball bearing products from two foreign suppliers and certain other products from other foreign suppliers 
our international sales and purchases are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including general economic conditions  import and export duties and restrictions  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully manage expanded operations and acquisitions 
over the years  we have made several acquisitions of complementary businesses  which we continue to integrate 
this integration strategy includes combining sales channels and customer service operations of these companies as well as integrating their engineering and manufacturing resources to develop value added systems incorporating our technological capabilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the integration process 
in addition  as part of our business development strategy  we plan to pursue further acquisitions in order to expand our product offerings  add to or enhance our base of technical and sales personnel or provide desirable customer relationships 
this growth could result in a significant strain on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of our future expansion  if any  in combination with the complexity of the technologies involved in our businesses  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our customers 
additionally  we cannot assure you that axsys will be able to acquire complementary businesses on a cost effective basis  integrate acquired operations into our organization effectively  retain and motivate key personnel  or retain customers of acquired firms 
we compete for attractive acquisition candidates with other companies or investors  and that competition could increase the cost of pursuing our acquisition strategy or reduce the number of attractive candidates to be acquired 
although axsys reviews and considers possible acquisitions on an on going basis  no specific acquisitions are being negotiated or planned as of the date of this report 
many key product components come from single source suppliers 
a significant portion of our precision machining business depends on the adequate supply of specialty metals  such as beryllium  at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
we currently procure all of our beryllium from brush wellman  the sole us supplier  and expect to continue to rely on brush wellman for beryllium for the foreseeable future 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our supplier in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationship will continue or that we will continue to obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect our gross margins 
the partial or complete loss of brush wellman as a supplier of beryllium  or production shortfalls or interruptions that otherwise impair our supply of beryllium  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is uncertain whether alternative sources of supply could be developed without a material disruption in our ability to provide beryllium products to our customers 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our other suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationships will continue or that  in the event of a termination of our relationships with those other suppliers  we would be able to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products to our customers 
in addition  we purchase a substantial amount of ball bearings that we distribute from two foreign suppliers 
any material disruption in our supply of products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel 
axsys success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key executive officers and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on our executive officers 
in addition  since our continued success is largely dependent upon our ability to design  manufacture and sell high performance components and subsystems for the high performance technology market  we are particularly dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical personnel  including engineers and skilled machinists  with the requisite educational background and industry experience 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time  and competition for personnel is intense 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be successful in retaining our existing personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our technical or skilled personnel  or the future inability to attract technical or skilled personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property rights 
the patents of competitors could impact our business 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  non disclosure agreements and other forms of intellectual property protection to safeguard our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection offered by these patents or as to the likelihood that patents will be issued for pending applications 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competitors in the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products 
although we believe that our existing products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  third parties could assert infringement claims against us and such claims could be successful 
we must comply with strict environmental regulations  both compliance and non compliance could result in material liabilities or costs 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our engineering  research and development and manufacturing activities 
failure to comply with applicable environmental requirements could result in substantial liability to axsys  suspension or cessation of our operations  restrictions on our ability to expand our operations or requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you a that changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or regulatory policy  or the discovery of unknown problems or conditions  will not in the future require substantial expenditures  or b as to the extent of our liabilities  if any  for past failures  if any  to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and permits  any of which also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  axsys recorded a charge to discontinued operations of million  before a tax benefit of million  relating to increases in reserves for certain environmental costs associated with formerly owned properties 
the current accruals of million associated with these sites assume that certain approvals will be received from state regulatory authorities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will receive these approvals 
if these approvals are not received  our costs could increase substantially 
in addition  even if such approvals are received  the costs actually incurred may exceed the reserves established 
during december  we received a letter from the united states environmental protection agency epa notifying us that we are considered to be a potentially responsible party at a site located in prospect  connecticut  which until was owned by a former subsidiary 
it is our policy to accrue environmental cleanup related costs only when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the quantification of environmental exposure with respect to this site  if any  requires an assessment of many factors  including the quality of information available  the assessment stage of each investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation 
currently  it is not possible for us to estimate a meaningful range of exposure based on the limited amount of information received 
we have made and continue to make investments in protective equipment  process controls  manufacturing procedures and training in order to minimize the risks to our employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of hazardous materials 
the failure to properly handle these materials could lead to harmful exposure for employees or to the discharge of certain hazardous waste materials 
since axsys does not carry environmental impairment insurance  such a failure could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  environmental problems could develop in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to invest significant resources to maintain and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities 
we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in state of the art equipment in order to increase  expand  update or relocate our manufacturing capabilities and facilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established manufacturing capabilities would require that we make further investment 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient funds from operations to finance any required investment or that other sources of funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
furthermore  any further expansion could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results and operations 
one shareholder controls a significant block of axsys stock and this concentration could affect important operating decisions 
the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of axsys owns approximately of the outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  he will have the ability to exert influence with respect to corporate actions  including the election of directors and certain sales or mergers and acquisitions 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially 
the price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
that price volatility may be attributable  at least in part  to the limited number of shares generally available for sale in the public market 
in addition  factors  such as  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products or services and the timing of announcements of acquisitions or dispositions by axsys or our competitors  as well as conditions in our markets generally  may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies and which sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
certain anti takeover provisions could cause harm to our shareholders 
our certificate of incorporation  as amended the certificate of incorporation  our by laws the by laws and the delaware general corporation law dgcl contain certain provisions which could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving axsys more difficult  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of axsys 
we have authorized  shares of our preferred stock  none of which is currently outstanding  and which we could issue without further shareholder approval and upon terms and conditions  and having rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock 
the by laws include provisions establishing advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and director nominations  and permitting the calling of special shareholder meetings only by the written consent of three quarters of the board of directors or the chairman of the board 
the certificate of incorporation provides that in lieu of a meeting  action may be taken by written consent of our shareholders only by unanimous consent 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of axsys  and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of common stock 
in addition  we are subject to section of the dgcl  which  among other things and subject to certain exceptions  restricts certain business transactions between a corporation and a shareholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of axsys without action by the shareholders and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in the event of a change of control of axsys  the vesting of outstanding options issued under our long term stock incentive plan may be accelerated at the discretion of the committee administering the plan or may be required to be accelerated under certain circumstances provided for in each incentive agreement 
absence of dividends on common stock 
axsys does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future
