these items of income do not arise from the company s ongoing business 
results of german and italian operations continue to suffer from the lack of a competitive automated instrument 
the company expects operating results to improve in these operations after the full european launch of its galileo instrument in the first quarter of fiscal comparison of years ended may  and may  net sales revenues for the year ended may  rose by million over the prior fiscal year largely due to the aggressive price increase begun in the third quarter of fiscal year and to new group contracts 
instrument sales for the year ended may  were up million to million 
instrument sales grew as a result of new placements and concentrated efforts to reduce the backlog of instruments  currently million  installed but not recorded as revenue due to post installation criteria 
the effect on revenues of the change in the euro exchange rate was a decrease of  for fiscal since the end of the fiscal year  the euro has strengthened against the dollar which favorably affected foreign net sales  for the two months ended july  by million 
instrument sales also benefited from the lifting of the safety notification on the abs in december  we lifted the safety notification for antibody screening and crossmatch assay  and were able to lift the safety notification for blood grouping and launch our version software on october  before we could lift the safety notification and install the new software  the company had to submit a corrective action plan to the us food and drug administration fda  and then service engineers had to complete field corrective action on the abs and to accumulate clinical data

gross profit increased million  as compared to the prior year  due to the aggressive price increases mentioned above

the galileo is designed to fulfill the need in europe for a high throughput blood serology testing device with a test menu that includes antibody screening 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had been developing an infrastructure to support an increased level of instrument sales 
however  in light of the issues with the abs and continued customer migration to purchasing groups  the company reevaluated the focus of its sales and marketing efforts 
the domestic sales staff was significantly reduced and the netherlands facility was closed  resulting in a positive effect on selling and marketing expenses 
travel expenses and commissions rose to partially offset the previous cost savings due to renewed instrumentation efforts and higher revenues  in the second half of fiscal year  from the domestic reagent price increases 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal are likely to increase with the impact of a full year of these travel expenses and commissions and sales effort in europe to market the galileo 
distribution expenses for the year ended may  decreased slightly compared to the prior year  but as a percentage of sales have decreased from to 
additional shipping expenses related to a new purchasing group were offset by volume discounts offered by carriers 
it is expected that distribution expenses for fiscal will increase to approximately as a percentage of sales  with the implementation of a new shipping package configuration designed to maintain acceptable environmental temperature and preserve product quality during shipment 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended may  increased million 
expenses in the prior year included million of nonrecurring expenses  primarily severance  related to the implementation of the cost savings plan 
the increase for the current year is due primarily to legal expenses related to the proxy contest incurred in the second quarter  various bank fees and professional fees incurred mainly for support of the enterprise software system after the june  implementation 
fiscal general and administrative expenses should decline as the company begins the second year on the enterprise software system 
due to continued operating losses and reorganization at the company s french and belgian operations  an impairment in value of the goodwill related to these acquisitions caused a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million in fiscal amortization expense declined million as compared with the prior period due to the goodwill impairment mentioned above 
in june of fiscal the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment factors arise  instead of amortized 
the company does not currently foresee any indications of impairment and expects amortization will be approximately million less in fiscal than in fiscal interest expense when compared to fiscal  interest expense increased million in fiscal the increase is the result of the increased borrowings on long term debt  bank fees related to the company s inability to maintain the financial covenants contained in its prior loan agreement due to past operating losses  and leases capitalized in fiscal fiscal interest expense is expected to decline due to lower outstanding debt and a more favorable interest rate pricing grid as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
other income other income for the year rose million

for the year  the company had issued credits reducing sales by million for returned instruments and had a reserve of million remaining for possible future returns

the strength of the us dollar versus the euro had the effect of reducing reported european sales by approximately million compared to the prior year

cost of sales increased by million as compared to the prior year  despite the decrease in sales 
there were additional expenditures of  incurred to resolve the abs issue  instrument backlog installation costs of  incurred in advance of revenue recognition  under absorption of fixed instrumentation support costs of  and reagents provided free of charge to customers performing backup testing amounting to  that all contributed to the negative impact on gross profit 
additionally  approximately million of the increase was caused by higher production costs due to increased fda regulatory requirements

the fourth quarter of fiscal benefited from the implementation of the cost savings plan  discussed above 
see results of operations 
distribution expenses as a percentage of sales increased from to for fiscal as compared to the prior year  although costs decreased approximately  due primarily to a  decrease in domestic shipping expense 
approximately of the domestic decrease was attributable to volume discounts offered by carriers and reduced overnight shipments 
consolidated shipments of core reagent products continued at or above historical levels 
the decrease in sales in fiscal was due primarily to the impact of the abs safety notification and the strength of the us dollar 
neither factor had a significant impact on distribution activities 
the major portion of the nonrecurring expenses related to the implementation of the cost savings plan was classified as general and administrative 
of the million in nonrecurring expenses  million was charged to general and administrative and was primarily related to severance 
amortization expense remained relatively constant with the prior period 
due to continued operating losses and reorganization at the company s french and belgian operations  an impairment in value of the goodwill related to these acquisitions caused a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million 
interest expense when compared to the prior year  interest expense increased  this was the result of increased borrowings and increased borrowing costs on long term debt and capitalized leases
