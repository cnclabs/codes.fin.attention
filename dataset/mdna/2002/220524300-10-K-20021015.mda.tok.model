item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition issues  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for up front  nonrefundable fees received in connection with research collaboration arrangements 
in accordance with sab  revenues from up front fees from our collaborators are deferred and recorded over the term that we provide ongoing services 
similarly  research support payments are recorded as revenue as we perform the research under the related agreements 
we record grant revenues as we incur expenses related to the grant projects 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research grants are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a comparable level to that before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

table of contents results of operations general from inception february  through june   revenues of cortex pharmaceuticals  inc cortex or the company have consisted of i  of license fees and research and development funding  ii net interest income aggregating  and iii  of grant revenue 
in january  the company entered a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement with nv organon organon  a pharmaceutical business unit of akzo nobel 
the agreement will allow organon to develop and commercialize the company s proprietary ampakine technology for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression 
in connection with the agreement  the company received a  up front licensing payment and research support payments of roughly  per year for two years 
during the year ended june   the company received the remaining scheduled research support from the agreement of  the agreement with organon also includes milestone payments based upon clinical development  plus royalty payments on worldwide sales 
cortex achieved its first milestone under the agreement in may  when organon selected a candidate compound to pursue in phase i clinical testing as a potential treatment for schizophrenia 
achieving this milestone triggered a  payment from organon  which cortex recorded as revenue upon achievement 
cortex achieved its second milestone under the agreement in september  when organon elected to continue development of the selected compound in phase ii clinical testing 
achieving the second milestone triggered another  payment from organon  with the related revenue recorded upon achievement of the milestone 
in april  the company entered into an option agreement with shire pharmaceuticals group  plc shire under which shire evaluated the use of the company s ampakine cx for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd 
in exchange for the option  cortex received  and issued  shares of common stock to shire for  shire was responsible for all costs associated with the clinical trial 
shire had the right to convert its option into an exclusive worldwide license for the ampakine technology for adhd under a development and licensing agreement 
in late june  shire elected not to exercise its option and terminated the phase ii study before reaching the anticipated enrollment levels 
under the terms of the option agreement  cortex regained all rights to cx and the ampakine technology for adhd 
cortex executed its right to acquire the data from the study  which it is analyzing while pursuing new partners that have expressed an interest in the ampakine technology as a potential treatment for the disorder 
in october  the company entered a research collaboration and an exclusive license agreement with les laboratoires servier servier 
the agreement will allow servier to develop and commercialize the company s ampakine technology for the treatment of declines in cognitive performance associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases 
the indications covered include  but are not limited to  alzheimer s disease  mild cognitive impairment  sexual dysfunction  and the dementia associated with multiple sclerosis and lou gehrig s disease 
the agreement with servier includes a nonrefundable up front fee of  which cortex is recording as revenue ratably over the agreement s three year research phase 
the agreement also includes research support payments of  per year for three years subject to cortex providing agreed upon levels of research personnel 
the amount of research support is subject to annual adjustment based 
table of contents upon the increase in the us department of labor s consumer price index

the agreement also includes milestone payments  plus royalty payments on sales in licensed territories 
in october  servier agreed to provide cortex with  of additional research support  in exchange for rights to the company s ampakine compounds for the potential treatment of anxiety disorders  in servier s licensed territories 
the  will be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period  beginning in october from inception february  through june   the company sustained losses aggregating  due to projected fluctuations in funding  continuing losses are likely over the next several years  as the company s ongoing operating expenses will only be offset  if at all  by research support payments and possible milestone payments from its research collaborations with organon and servier  or under planned strategic alliances that the company is seeking with other pharmaceutical companies for the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of its products 
the nature and timing of payments to cortex under the organon and servier agreements or other planned strategic alliances  if and when entered into  are likely to significantly affect the company s operations and financing activities and to produce substantial period to period fluctuations in reported financial results 
over the longer term  the company will require successful commercial development of its products by organon  servier  or its other prospective partners to attain sustained profitable operations from royalties or other product based revenues 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on its ongoing operations to date 
fiscal years ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june   the company s net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
the difference primarily represented increased research and licensing revenues

the cross national study  conducted in collaboration with servier  commenced enrollment in march servier has agreed to support the bulk of the costs for this study 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  also included technology access payments related to the organon milestone achieved in september the company previously licensed the ampakine technology from the university of california 
under the related agreement  the company is required to remit a portion of certain remuneration received in connection with sublicensing agreements 
when the company achieved its milestone under its agreement with organon  a technology access payment to the university of california became due

revenues for the fiscal year ended june  also included a full year of organon research revenues 
the two year collaborative research phase of the organon agreement ended in mid january  producing only roughly a half year of research revenues for the year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   revenues related to the agreement with servier partially offset the decreased revenues from the agreement with organon 
cortex received a  nonrefundable  up front payment from servier in october  and in accordance with sab  is recording the related revenues ratably over the three year research phase of the related agreement

under the terms of the agreement  cortex may receive additional milestone payments based on clinical development of the licensed technology and ultimately  royalties on worldwide sales 
research and licensing payments received under the agreement with servier totaled  through june  of this amount  cortex received  during the year ended june  the agreement provides research support of approximately  per year for three years  subject to annual adjustment based on the us department of labor s consumer price index 
beginning in october  servier has agreed to provide an additional  of research support to cortex  to be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period 
the agreement also includes milestone payments based upon successful clinical development and royalties on sales in licensed territories 
in october  cortex received notice of a phase ii small business innovative research sbir award from the national institutes of health 
the award will provide up to  over a three year period and will offset the company s expenses in researching its ampakine compounds as a potential new therapy for stroke 
as of june   cortex had received approximately  related to this grant award 
in september  the company received notice of a second phase ii sbir award from the national institutes of health 
this award will provide up to  over a two year period  which will allow cortex to follow up on previously reported studies of the ampakine cx as a combination therapy for schizophrenia 
earlier tests were encouraging  with ampakine treated patients showing improvement in a number of clinical and neurocognitive scores 
as of june   cortex had received  from this grant award 
cash proceeds as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and a working capital deficit of  as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  the decrease in cash as of june  reflected amounts required to fund operations 
for both periods  working capital included deferred revenue relating to the company s  nonrefundable  up front payment from the agreement with servier 
in accordance with sab  the company is recording the revenue related to the up front payment ratably over the agreement s three year collaborative research phase  which began in december current liabilities as of june  and included  of unearned revenues from the servier up front fee 
excluding these unearned revenues  working capital as of june  and totaled  and  respectively 
commitments the company leases approximately  square feet of research laboratory  office and expansion space under an operating lease that expires may  the commitments under the lease agreement for the years ending june  and are  and  respectively 
from inception february  through june   net expenditures for furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements aggregated  the company is committed to  for sponsored research and other remuneration to academic institutions  of which  is payable over the next months 
in addition  in august the company became committed to severance payments to its former chief executive officer in the aggregate amount of  which payments will be made in monthly installments commencing in mid august and ending in mid august 
table of contents together with its corporate partner  servier  the company is conducting a cross national clinical study with the ampakine cx in patients with mild cognitive impairment mci 
enrollment in the trial began in march and servier has agreed to incur the bulk of the related costs 
remaining cortex commitments for phase i iia clinical studies on the ampakine compounds are not significant 
in june  the company received  from the institute for the study of aging the institute  which will partially offset the company s costs for the testing in patients with mci 
given that cortex must use the funding from the institute solely for clinical trials  the company has recorded the amounts received as restricted cash in its balance sheet 
provided that cortex complies with the conditions of the funding agreement  including the restricted use of the amounts received  repayment of the advance shall not be required unless cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical trials for alzheimer s disease 
upon such potential clinical trials  repayment would include interest computed at a rate equal to one half of the prime lending rate 
in lieu of cash  in the event of repayment the institute may elect to receive the balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest as shares of cortex common stock 
the conversion price for such form of repayment shall initially equal per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
staffing as of june   cortex had employees 
as of october   cortex had employees 
neither significant investments in plant or equipment nor increases to staffing levels are contemplated under current spending plans for the upcoming fiscal year 
outlook cortex anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents and scheduled research support payments from its agreements with servier will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements into early fiscal year additional funds will be required to continue operations beyond that time 
cortex may receive additional milestone payments from the organon and servier agreements  but there is no assurance that the company will receive such milestone payments within the desired timeframe  or at all 
see risk factors if we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms  we may need to significantly curtail our operations 
in order to provide for both its immediate and longer term spending requirements  the company is presently seeking collaborative or other arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
under these agreements  it is intended that such companies would provide additional capital to the company in exchange for exclusive or non exclusive license or other rights to certain of the technologies and products the company is developing 
competition for such arrangements is intense  however  with a large number of biopharmaceutical companies attempting to secure alliances with more established pharmaceutical companies 
although the company has been engaged in discussions with candidate companies  there is no assurance that an agreement or agreements will arise from these discussions in a timely manner  or at all  or that revenues that may be generated thereby will offset operating expenses sufficiently to reduce the company s short and longer term funding requirements 
because there is no assurance that the company will secure additional corporate partnerships  the company may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
there is no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if equity securities are issued to raise additional funds  dilution to existing stockholders is likely to result 
the company s proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant further research  development  clinical testing and regulatory clearances 
they are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective 
table of contents or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  that the proposed products  although effective  will be uneconomical to market  that third parties may now or in the future hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from marketing them  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict whether its research and development activities will result in any commercially viable products or applications 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the company does not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for at least five years  either directly or through its prospective corporate partners or licensees 
there can be no assurance that the company s proposed products will prove to be safe or effective or receive regulatory approvals that are required for commercial sale

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its marketable securities and borrowing arrangement 
all investments in marketable securities are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company is not subject to risks from currency rate fluctuations as it does not typically conduct transactions in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company does not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of the company s financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
the company manages interest rate risk on its investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with its cash requirements 
at june   the company s investment portfolio had a fair value and carrying amount of approximately  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the resulting decline in the fair value of fixed rate bonds held within the portfolio would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s borrowing consists solely of its advance from the institute for the study of aging  which is subject to potential repayment in the event that cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical testing as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
potential repayment would include interest accruing at a discount to the prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but  based upon historical activity  such changes are not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
at june   the principal and accrued interest of the advance amounted to
