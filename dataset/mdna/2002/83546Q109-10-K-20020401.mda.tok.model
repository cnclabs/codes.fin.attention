overview sonicblue designs  develops and markets products for the converging internet  digital media  entertainment and consumer electronics markets 
our products include rio digital audio players  replaytv personal television technology and software solutions  and go video dual deck vcrs and integrated dvd vcrs 
prior to the transfer in january of our graphics chips business to s graphics co  ltd  we were a supplier of graphics and multimedia accelerator subsystems for pcs for over ten years 
acquisitions and divestitures on august   sonicblue completed the acquisition of replaytv  inc  a developer of personal television technology 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
at closing  sonicblue issued million shares of common stock and assumed an aggregate of million options and warrants to purchase shares of sonicblue common stock in exchange for all of replaytv s outstanding equity  and replaytv became a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue 
prior to closing the acquisition  sonicblue made loans to replaytv in the amount of million  which became part of the purchase price 
on june   sonicblue completed the acquisition of sensory science corporation  a developer of consumer electronics products  including dual deck videocassette player recorders and dvd players 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
at closing  sonicblue issued approximately million shares of sonicblue common stock to sensory science stockholders in exchange for the common stock of sensory science outstanding  and sensory science became a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue 
prior to closing the acquisition  sonicblue made loans to sensory science in the amount of million  which became part of the purchase price 
in march  sonicblue completed the sale to ati technologies  inc ati of its professional graphics division  based in starnberg  germany  which produced the fire gl line of graphics accelerators 
under the terms of an asset purchase agreement  sonicblue has received million in cash through december   and is eligible to receive further financial consideration of up to million  contingent upon the fire gl graphics business  as operated by ati  achieving future performance targets 
in january  sonicblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips net assets  other than its shares of common stock of s via  inc s via  to s graphics co  ltd 
s graphics  a joint venture between via technologies  inc via and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue 
the joint venture manufactures and distributes semiconductor products and conducts related research and development activities 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement with via  sonicblue received million shares of sonicblue common stock in return for a reduction of its economic interest in the future operations of the joint venture to 
under the joint venture agreement  sonicblue will also receive earn out payments if the new venture meets specified profitability goals 
in november  sonicblue acquired united kingdom digital audio equipment manufacturer empeg limited at an initial purchase price of million 
in november  a purchase price adjustment of million was recorded resulting in a total purchase price of million 
in august  sonicblue shut down its diamond multimedia branded graphics add in board business 
the shutdown did not extend to sonicblue s professional graphics division  headquartered in germany  which continued to develop and market its line of fire gl graphics accelerators until  as discussed above  sonicblue sold its professional graphics division to ati technologies 
on february   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of number nine visual technology corporation number nine 
the purchase price of million included million of cash and million in estimated expenses of the transaction 
the purchase price was allocated as follows million to the estimated fair value of number nine net assets  million to workforce in place and million to goodwill 
goodwill was recorded as a result of consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and identified acquisition related intangible assets have been amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in november  sonicblue established a majority owned corporate joint venture  s via  with via to bring high performance integrated graphics and core logic chip sets to the volume oem desktop and notebook pc markets 
s via has exclusive access to both companies technology and distribution rights for developed products between sonicblue and via 
sonicblue consolidated the accounts of s via in its consolidated financial statements through the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company terminated its participation in s via 
as a result  sonicblue wrote off the net assets of the joint venture  which resulted in an unrecognized gain of million 
since the actual process of withdrawing from the venture will continue and ultimately be a part of other negotiations that are on going with via  sonicblue has deferred recognition of any gain until a comprehensive settlement of all outstanding issues is reached with via 
in october  sonicblue caused rioport  inc formerly rioport 
com  inc  which was a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue  to sell shares of its preferred stock to third party investors 
rioport is developing an integrated platform for acquiring  managing and experiencing music and spoken audio programming from the internet 
sonicblue retains a minority investment in rioport and accounts for its investment using the equity method 
in september  sonicblue made a significant strategic shift by merging with diamond multimedia systems  inc diamond  an established pc original equipment manufacturer or oem and retail provider of communications and home networking solutions  pc graphics and audio add in boards and digital audio players 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of diamond and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities as of september   assumed are included in sonicblue s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  inventories  legal contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting policies  which may involve a higher degree of judgment  complexity and estimates 
revenue recognition we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including price protection  promotions and special pricing agreements 
if a different number of customers redeem incentives than estimated  adjustments to revenue may be required 
accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded at the time of the sale 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates is not representative of future returns  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include a long term investment in umc 
the recorded value of the long term investment in umc is dependent upon the economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general 
if there is a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary  we will be required to decrease the value of our long term investment in umc  which will be recorded as expense in the period of the decline 
we analyze our umc investment at least quarterly 
the short term portion of the investment represents the unrestricted shares or available for sale shares 
these shares are recorded as a current asset and are marked to market value quarterly 
any holding gain or loss is recognized as a separate component of stockholders equity as required by sfas the restricted or long term portion of the investment is recorded at adjusted cost as a long term investment 
these shares are marked to market value only if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary or a permanent impairment 
in the event of a permanent impairment  the decrease in value of the short and long term portions of the umc investment are recorded as expense in the statement of operations 
inventories we record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
our products typically experience short life cycles and in determining market value  we make assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we utilize a month rolling forecast to identify potential excess and obsolete or slow moving inventory 
we may apply judgment to the amounts thus identified in establishing the reserve requirements 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the assumptions used  additional inventory write downs may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
where we believe it is probable an obligation exists we have accrued an estimate of the costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due ranging from for current amounts to for amounts more than days past due 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
assets are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we use several impairment indicators such as operating losses  significant adverse changes in the legal and economic climate  and changes in the manner in which an asset is used 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
effective january   we will adopt statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues during the first three months of  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and administrative restructuring expense and impairment charge in process research and development amortization of goodwill  intangibles and deferred compensation total operating expenses loss from operations gain loss on umc investment loss on other investments gain on sale of manufacturing joint venture interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales our current products are used in  and our business is dependent upon  the converging internet  digital media  entertainment and consumer electronics markets 
sales of our products are primarily in the united states and to a lesser extent in europe and asia 
prior to the transfer in january of our graphics chips business to s graphics and the shutdown of our graphics board business beginning in august  a significant percentage of our sales were to international oems 
the following table summarizes our net sales by product line s in millions year ended december  consumer electronics modems chips s via boards other total net sales were million in  a decrease of from million in this decrease was due to the transfer of the graphics chips business to s graphics in january  the sale of the professional graphics division to ati technologies in march and the shutdown of the multimedia board business in the third quarter of fiscal this was partially offset by the sales of go video dual deck vcrs and integrated dvd vcrs  which was acquired by sonicblue through the acquisition of sensory science in june more than of our net sales in consisted of consumer electronics products and diamond brand modems 
we expect that consumer electronics and modem products will represent our core technology for the foreseeable future 
net sales were million in  an increase of from million in this increase was due to the acquisition of diamond in and the inclusion of diamond product sales in revenues beginning on september  net sales in consisted primarily of graphics chips  diamond brand graphics add in cards  modem and communications products and rio digital audio players 
in our consumer electronics and modem products represented of net sales as we exited the graphics business 
net sales for consisted primarily of graphics chip and board products 
in our consumer electronics and modem products represented of net sales 
we expect that the percentage of net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their life cycles 
we anticipate that the majority of our revenues will continue to be generated from our consumer electronics and modem product lines 
no further revenues are anticipated from chips and boards 
we have experienced significant year over year revenue growth in our core technology products of consumer electronics and modems 
this core revenue grew to million in from million in  and to million in from million in due to competitive price pressures  our products experience declining average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
sales of our products are primarily in the united states and to a lesser extent in europe and asia 
international sales accounted for in  in and in of net sales  excluding the net sales of s via 
although there can be no assurances that international sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels  we expect such sales will continue to represent a consistent percentage of net sales 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
costco and best buy accounted for and of net sales in  excluding the net sales of s via 
one customer accounted for of net sales in excluding the net sales of s via 
two customers accounted for and of net sales in we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
gross margin we had a negative gross margin of in  a negative gross margin of in and a positive gross margin of in the decrease in margin in was primarily the result of costs associated with exiting the graphics board and chip businesses as well as million in production cancellation costs and write downs of tooling and obsolete inventory associated with restructuring activities 
the negative gross margin in was primarily the result of a high sales mix of lower margin mp players and modem products  and a million charge for the write down of inventory relating to the shutdown of the diamond multimedia branded graphics add in board business 
another factor resulting in decreased gross margin was the highly competitive pricing pressures in the market for mainstream and entertainment graphics accelerators 
this was partially offset by improving margins on our desktop chips and communications products 
gross margin in was favorably affected by an increase in average selling prices and an increase in sales of products with higher margins  partially offset by charges for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market provisions made in during the quarter ended december   we had a positive gross margin of 
this was primarily the result of adding the sensory science product lines and supply chain management efficiencies as well as our focus on higher volume and higher margin products 
in the future  our gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in the unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing and volume of shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold and the extent to which we incur or obtain additional licensing fees 
although there can be no assurances  we expect gross margin improvements in the upcoming year due to continuing efforts to improve supply chain management and our focus on higher volume and higher margin products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  and fees for consulting services 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses decreased from to  primarily due to reduced headcount and related personnel costs resulting from the shutdown of our multimedia board business and the transfer of our graphics chips business 
research and development expenses increased by from to as a result of the increased headcount and related expenses associated with the diamond acquisition 
we have made and intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products 
we intend to continue to focus on core technology and products while concentrating on efforts to reduce overhead  headcount and related costs 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  selling costs  facilities costs and fees for professional services  such as legal and accounting services 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  marketing and administrative expenses decreased from to primarily due to reduced headcount and related personnel costs resulting from the shutdown of the multimedia board business and the transfer of our graphics chips business and restructuring activities in this decrease was partially offset by the cost of settling securities litigation  totaling million in the increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses from to was due primarily to the integration and combination of selling  marketing and administrative headcount and related expenses associated with the acquisition of diamond and empeg limited 
other factors that affected marketing expenses were costs associated with the refocusing of our business including our name change and image in november we expect a further reduction of selling  marketing and administrative expenses in due to our on going cost containment efforts and as we fully realize the benefits of our restructuring activities 
restructuring expense and impairment charge in april  we adopted a restructuring plan relating to our long term strategy and focus on changes in the market  technology  customer demands  and methods of distribution 
we continued the restructuring activities in both the third and fourth quarters of specific actions included reducing our worldwide workforce by approximately employees  consolidating facilities  discontinuing unprofitable products and closing offices in unprofitable locations 
restructuring expenses of million in primarily included the write off of goodwill and other intangibles million  facilities closure expenses million  personnel severance compensation and related expenses million and contract termination and other costs million 
as part of the restructuring  we also expensed approximately million in inventory and related charges  through cost of sales 
due to the circumstances created by the significant downturns in the digital media markets  we recorded an impairment charge against the goodwill and intangibles associated with our acquisitions of diamond multimedia and empeg limited 
these downturns negatively affected the forecasted revenues and cash flows from the diamond and empeg limited businesses acquired in and in accordance with our policy  undiscounted cash flows indicated that the assets were impaired 
we calculated the impairment charge by comparing the expected discounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related intangible assets 
this resulted in a million impairment write down of goodwill and other intangibles during in august  we adopted a restructuring plan relating to the shutdown of our diamond multimedia branded add in board business to reflect our long term strategy and focus 
specific actions taken included the write off of intangibles million  facilities closure expenses million and personnel severance compensation and related expenses million 
as part of the restructuring  we also expensed million in inventory  through cost of sales 
the related accrued restructuring and impairment charges activity was as follows in thousands severance redundant compensation and facilities goodwill and contract and related expenses related costs intangibles other costs total restructuring and impairment charges    cash payments non cash charges   balance december    restructuring and impairment charges      cash payments    non cash charges     balance december      in process research and development expenses in process research and development expenses in included a write off of acquired technologies of million related to the purchase of sensory science corporation and million related to the purchase of replaytv  inc in process research and development expenses in included a write off of acquired technologies of million related to the purchase of diamond multimedia systems  inc the million and million of in process research and development charges represents the value  using a discounted cash flow methodology  to be attributable to the in process research and development of sensory science corporation and replaytv  inc based on a valuation analysis of such research and development 
these amounts were determined through valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry and were immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
management believes that the allocation of the purchase price to in process research and development is appropriate given the future potential of this research and development to contribute to our operations 
amortization of goodwill  intangibles and deferred compensation amortization of goodwill and intangibles was million in  million in and million in the decrease in is due to the write off of approximately million of goodwill and other intangibles in  partially offset by the increased amortization associated with goodwill and intangibles recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of sensory science 
deferred compensation expense was million in resulting from the amortization of the million of deferred compensation recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of replaytv  inc  and deferred compensation expense was zero in and amortization of goodwill and intangibles increased million from to primarily due to the full year of amortization of goodwill and intangibles recorded as a result of the diamond acquisition 
the diamond acquisition was effective in september  at which time the amortization began 
amortization charges should decrease further in due to the full year impact of the write off noted above and the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
amortization of goodwill alone was million in  million in and million in gain loss on umc investment the company sold million shares of umc stock in and sold million shares in on the taiwan stock exchange  resulting in realized losses of million and million respectively 
at december   the market value of the investment in umc had declined to an amount significantly below its original basis 
we determined at that point that this decline was related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as a whole and was temporary in nature due to the historically cyclical nature of the industry 
during the first half of  we concluded that the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general was more severe than previously anticipated and that there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry would recover from this down cycle 
because we concluded that the decline in value of umc was other than temporary  we reported an unrealized loss on the umc investment of million  based on the market value at june  gain loss on other investments during we recognized a loss of million primarily related to the write down of certain equity investments 
during we recognized a loss of million and during a loss of million related to these investments 
the downturn in the economy  particularly in the high technology sector  contributed to the decline in the market value of these securities 
gain on sale of manufacturing joint venture on december   we entered into an agreement with umc  to sell to umc million shares of stock of usc  for a price of approximately million 
we received the sales price in january upon closing 
the gain on the sale of stock in usc recorded in was million 
in june  we amended our agreement with umc 
under the terms of the amended agreement  umc agreed to pay us approximately million in cash and we agreed to release umc from certain contingencies associated with the usc stock sale and to grant a license to umc for certain patents for products manufactured by umc 
we recognized the gain on this transaction over five fiscal quarters beginning in the quarter ended june   as payments were received 
in  the gain recognized on the sale of the stock in usc was million 
in  the gain recognized on the sale of stock in usc was million 
no gain was recognized during as payments have ceased under the agreement 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in up from million in up from million in  primarily due to increased interest and bank fees associated with lines of credit and increased borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  we paid off our remaining loan balance with china trust 
we expect to continue to incur significant interest charges associated with our convertible subordinated debt and  to a lesser extent  interest and fees associated with our line of credit 
other income expense  net other income expense net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the other income increase from to was primarily due to proceeds received from ati upon reaching certain milestones associated with the sale of our professional graphics division and on the mark to market impact of our call option collars 
we obtained the call option collars in connection with the sale of a portion of our umc holdings in the other income decrease from to was primarily due to foreign currency losses in the other income in consisted primarily of foreign currency gains 
income taxes our effective tax benefit rate was for as compared to an effective tax rate of for  and a tax benefit rate of for our effective tax benefit rate for reflects the expected benefits of current year and prior year net operating loss and tax credit carryovers  offset by valuation allowances related to our net tax assets 
the effective tax rate for reflects the effects of the gain on the umc shares and the inability to use the goodwill amortization and foreign losses to reduce taxable income 
the benefit tax rate for reflects the expected benefits of current year and prior year net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
due to uncertainty associated with our prospective ability to realize the benefits of our tax assets  we have fully reserved the value of our net deferred tax assets and do not expect to record any tax benefit or provision associated with any further operating losses in the near future dependent upon results from foreign operations and unrealized gains from investments  including umc shares 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to cash used in operations of million  and repayments of notes payable and other financing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided from sales of umc and other investing activities of million 
cash used for operating activities was million in this amount was far less than our million net loss because our net loss included several charges that did not use cash such as the loss on our umc investment of million  the decrease in deferred income taxes of million and the charges related to the impairment of long lived assets of million 
cash used for operating activities was million in and consisted primarily of net income of million  which included a non cash gain on our umc investment of million 
this was partially offset by non cash charges including a decrease of deferred income taxes of million and amortization and depreciation of million 
investing activities provided cash of million in and consisted primarily of million received from sales and maturities of short term investments including cash received from the sale of million umc shares on the taiwan stock exchange  offset by funding provided to replaytv and sensory science  in connection with our acquisitions of those companies 
investing activities provided cash of million in and consisted primarily of sales and maturities of short term investments of million  including a portion of our umc investment  partially offset by purchases of short term investments and equity investments in technology companies of million 
financing activities used cash of million in and consisted of repayments of notes payable partially offset by sales of common stock 
financing activities provided cash of million in and consisted of sales of common stock of million  including proceeds from the private sale of stock to via  and borrowings under notes payable totaling million 
we had a working capital deficit of million at december   and positive working capital of million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the significant degradation in the value of our available for sale umc holdings  combined with continued operating losses and our investments in sensory science and replaytv 
we funded our operating losses and investment activities primarily through the sale of a portion of our holdings in umc 
a portion of the umc shares received by sonicblue are subject to restrictions on their sale that lapse over a three year period 
at december   approximately million shares were subject to restrictions that will lapse in more than one year and are recorded at adjusted cost as a long term investment 
the million unrestricted shares includes shares where the restrictions will lapse in one year or less 
these shares are recorded as a current asset and are marked to market value through other comprehensive income 
in addition  we expect to receive a declared stock dividend of million shares of available for sale and freely tradable stock in august sensory science corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue  has loans under a line of credit with congress financial corporation  which has a maturity date of march  the maximum line of credit is million with a borrowing limit of million  limited by a borrowing base determined by specific inventory and receivable balances of sensory science and an availability block of million 
the line of credit is collateralized by assets of sensory science corporation and by a guarantee of sonicblue 
during  we sold a portion of our umc holdings  aggregating approximately million shares  in a derivative transaction 
in connection with the sales of these umc holdings  we purchased a series of call option collars on umc stock with an aggregate notional amount of million shares 
these transactions provided us funds from the sale of the shares while allowing us to participate in future increases in the value of umc shares  if any  through this series of call option collars 
we have incurred significant losses and expect such losses to continue for at least the next twelve months 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
we expect to experience negative cash flow from operations for at least the next few quarters and believe that sufficient funds will be available to support planned operations through december our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors including the rate at which customers accept and purchase our existing and future products  the rate at which we invest in engineering  development and intellectual property with respect to existing and future products  the level of marketing required to acquire and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  the operational costs that we incur to continue to develop our business as a whole  our ability to sell our umc shares  when needed  and at reasonable prices  receipt  in august  of the declared stock dividend of million umc shares  use of financial instruments to allow us to monetize our long term umc share holdings  the willingness of the creditors of our legacy businesses to accept extended payment terms  and pending litigation as discussed in item legal proceedings 
we recognize the desirability for the infusion of cash during fiscal and are actively pursuing various options 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may wish to selectively pursue possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  technologies or products complementary to ours in order to expand our geographic presence  broaden our product offerings  and achieve operating efficiencies 
we may not have sufficient liquidity  or we may be unable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all  in order to finance such an acquisition or investment 
an adverse business or legal development may require us to raise additional financing 
we recognize that we may be required to raise such additional capital  at times and in amounts  which are uncertain  especially under the current capital market conditions 
if we are unable to acquire additional capital or are required to raise it on terms that are less satisfactory than we desire  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  which could require additional restructuring of our company 
if necessary  we may be required to consider curtailing our operations significantly or to seek arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish significant rights to products  technologies or markets 
our contractual obligations and commitments  which are described elsewhere in our financial statements have been summarized in the table below payments due in balance as of contractual obligations december  after dollars in thousands lease commitments      long term debt   amounts expiring in balance as of commitments december  after dollars in thousands financial guarantees lines of credit  under lease commitments we have included total future minimum rent expense under non cancelable leases for both current and abandoned facilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the standard also establishes specific guidance for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for our fiscal year however  goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of replaytv in august were subject to the non amortization provisions of sfas during amortization of goodwill alone was million in  million in and million in based upon acquisitions completed as of june   application of the goodwill non amortization provisions is expected to result in a decrease in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million for from million to million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for our fiscal year and will be applied prospectively 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect our results because sonicblue s largest financial asset is its shares of united microelectronics corporation  the volatility of sonicblue common stock and available cash may be influenced by the volatility of umc s stock price 
sonicblue s ability to sell its umc shares is subject to lockup and pledge restrictions 
sonicblue s largest financial asset is its umc shares 
the market price of umc s stock is subject to volatility due to general market conditions as well as actual or anticipated changes in umc s business prospects or quarterly or yearly operating results 
because the umc shares are sonicblue s largest asset  when the price per share of umc s stock increases or declines  the price of sonicblue s common stock on the nasdaq national market tends to follow changes in umc s stock price 
fluctuations in the price of sonicblue common stock caused by changes in umc s stock price may or may not reflect sonicblue s actual or anticipated business prospects or quarterly results 
also  fluctuations in umc s stock price may cause fluctuations in sonicblue s stock price when there is no material news regarding sonicblue or any change in its results 
in addition  due to taiwan governmental restrictions  as of december   approximately million of sonicblue s umc shares are subject to lockup restrictions  which are being released over a three year period ending in january as a result  sonicblue s ability to sell its umc shares is limited 
sonicblue experienced net operating losses in the past and may experience net operating losses again in the future 
sonicblue had a net loss of million for the year ended december   primarily resulting from the recognition of a loss of million related to the decline in value of its umc shares 
sonicblue had net income of million for the year ended december   primarily from recognizing a gain of million on the umc shares but not as a result of income from operations 
sonicblue had a net loss of million for with the completion of the transfer of sonicblue s graphics chips business  sonicblue s ability to achieve operating profitability depends primarily on its success in refocusing its business resources and in executing its business plan for its refocused business 
in addition  sonicblue must achieve positive gross margins at a level sufficient to offset its operating expenses 
sonicblue experienced negative gross margins in and in the first six months of and could continue to experience negative gross margins 
sonicblue cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain the positive gross margins it achieved in the last six months of  nor can sonicblue assure you that it will be able to achieve operating profitability 
if sonicblue is unable to achieve operating profitability or incurs future losses and negative cash flow  its stock price would likely decline 
sonicblue has recently changed the focus of its business and may be unsuccessful or experience difficulties in implementing this change 
if this occurs  sonicblue may not be able to achieve operating profitability 
in january  sonicblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips business to s graphics co  ltd  a joint venture between via technologies  inc and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue 
concurrently  sonicblue realigned its resources to focus on the converging internet  digital media  entertainment and consumer electronics markets 
to that end  sonicblue recently completed acquisitions of sensory science corporation and replaytv  inc  both of which are in the consumer electronics and digital media industries 
sonicblue has a limited operating history with these markets  and its shift in focus may prove to be unsuccessful 
in connection with this shift in focus  it may be necessary to implement new business processes and internal controls 
in addition  the convergence of these industries is new and continually evolving 
sonicblue must compete with larger  more established competitors in these markets  and sonicblue may be unable to achieve market success 
sonicblue s profitability depends on its ability to successfully implement its new business strategy 
sonicblue develops audio products for a new market  which may not develop if consumers do not accept digital audio as their preferred method of listening to music 
similarly  the market for replaytv digital video recorders may not develop if consumers do not accept personal television 
the market for digital audio products is new and evolving 
sonicblue s digital audio products play music that consumers download from the internet or cds 
the success of sonicblue s digital audio products depends in part on consumers using the internet  rather than using solely traditional sources  such as record stores where they buy cds or cassette tapes  as a source of music 
if consumers do not access music on the internet  or from their cds  and download it for use on sonicblue s digital audio products  a market for sonicblue s digital audio products may not develop or may be limited 
replaytv digital video recorders are part of a new and largely untested market for personal television 
if television viewers do not accept and demand replaytv products and services  the market for replaytv products will be limited 
a reduction in the availability or ease of downloading music from the internet will hurt the sales of sonicblue s products 
sonicblue s digital audio products play music downloaded from the internet and cds 
currently  a variety of litigation is pending that could decrease the availability of downloadable music available on the internet 
for example  the five major record companies have sued napster 
com  an internet service that allows its users to swap songs 
the lawsuits maintain that the swapping of music between different users free of charge is a violation of the copyright laws in the united states 
if the record companies prevail in the litigation  and napster or companies offering similar services are forced to limit the selection of music available for download or are forced to go out of business  there would be a reduction in the amount of music available to consumers on the internet 
in march  the court issued an injunction that ordered napster to prevent users from trading copyrighted songs on its web site 
napster suspended its file transfer services in july  and while napster reached a preliminary settlement with the national music publishers association  litigation continues with respect to copyright infringement claims 
napster has announced plans to launch a subscription based service for digital music 
members of the music and film industries have filed lawsuits against other web sites that offer file transfer services similar to those previously offered by napster 
some web sites and record companies are working to provide fee based downloading of copyright protected music files 
if these web sites are unsuccessful in providing copyright protected music files or if consumers find the downloading too difficult or expensive  acceptance of the internet as a source of music would decline 
in addition  the rate at which the major record companies make their music available for digital purchases may discourage the use of digital audio players or reduce sonicblue s sales 
some record companies and internet companies are distributing  or have announced plans to create  cds or digital music that cannot be copied or can only be copied a limited number of times  which would also limit the ability of users to download music from their own cd collections or share their music with others 
new copyright protection measures  such as these  increased fees associated with making multiple copies of music from personal collections  or changes in copyright laws  could diminish the ability of consumers to download music to sonicblue s digital audio products 
reductions in the availability or ease of downloading music from the internet  or limitations on copying from personal cds  could also impair the use and sale of sonicblue s digital audio products 
sonicblue historically has had significant product concentration and currently depends on the health of the consumer electronics market 
this means that a decline in demand for a single product  or in the consumer electronics market in general  could severely affect sonicblue s overall revenues and financial results 
sonicblue s revenues have historically been dependent on the markets for graphics video chips for pcs and on its ability to compete in those markets 
with the completion of the transfer of the graphics chips assets to a joint venture between via and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue  sonicblue s remaining businesses continue to have significant product concentration 
sonicblue is dependent on the markets for digital audio players  digital and analog video products  modems  and other consumer electronics products 
sonicblue s business would be materially harmed if it were unsuccessful in selling digital audio players  including its rio players  its go video vcrs and dvd players or its replaytv digital video recorders 
a decline in demand or average selling prices for these products would have a material adverse effect on sonicblue s sales and operating results 
sonicblue s business is dependent on the internet and the development of the internet infrastructure 
the acceptance and sale of sonicblue s products could decrease if the infrastructure of the internet  particularly the development of broadband internet access  does not continue to be developed and maintained 
for example  if consumers do not have the necessary speed and data capacity for downloading music  rendering the internet too slow of a method for obtaining music  consumers may choose not to download music  which will decrease demand for sonicblue s digital audio products 
similarly  sonicblue s replaytv digital video recorders rely or will rely on high speed access to the internet to provide compelling content or  to access television programming information and send recorded programs to friends 
in addition  sonicblue s success will depend in large part on increased use of the internet  which in turn can increase demand for high speed communications products and the products that benefit from high speed connections 
sonicblue s success will also depend on businesses and consumers using the internet more frequently for applications that use multimedia content and that require high bandwidth 
recent growth in internet use has caused frequent periods of performance degradation 
any perceived degradation in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of sonicblue s connectivity and digital media products  such as rio digital audio players and replaytv products 
the performance of sonicblue s products depends on the speed and reliability of the internet infrastructure itself 
as a result  the emergence and growth of the market for sonicblue s products will depend on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure 
the joint venture with via will require sonicblue to pay specified liquidated damages if certain events occur  and earn out payments to sonicblue from the joint venture are subject to the joint venture meeting aggressive profitability goals 
the investment agreement between sonicblue  via and s graphics provides that under certain circumstances  sonicblue may be required to pay via significant liquidated damages if  unless as a result of certain acts or omissions on the part of either via or s graphics  s graphics is prevented by court order from utilizing sonicblue s patent cross license with intel corporation or if sonicblue enters into a settlement agreement with intel such that s graphics can no longer operate under the patent cross license 
in september  intel filed a patent infringement lawsuit against s graphics and via 
sonicblue is not a party to the lawsuit 
the lawsuit is in early stages 
any liquidated damages that sonicblue might be required to pay to via under the investment agreement may under certain circumstances be reduced by amounts paid by sonicblue to intel in connection with any lawsuit and amounts owed to sonicblue by either via or s graphics 
an adverse result or settlement with regard to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on sonicblue s financial condition or results of operations 
sonicblue will receive earn out payments if s graphics meets aggressive profitability goals specified in the joint venture agreement between the parties 
there can be no assurance that s graphics will be able to meet these profitability goals 
sonicblue may not be able to successfully manage the growth and expansion of its business 
in the past two years  particularly following its merger with diamond and with its recent acquisitions of sensory science and replaytv  sonicblue has experienced a significant expansion in the overall level of its business and the scope and changed nature of its operations  including manufacturing  research and development  marketing  technical support  customer service  sales and logistics 
this expansion has resulted in significant challenges  and a need for substantial investment in  infrastructure  process development and information systems  including attracting  integrating and retaining key employees  integration of management information  product data management  internal control  accounting  telecommunications and networking systems  establishment of a significant worldwide web and e commerce presence  consolidation of geographically dispersed manufacturing and distribution facilities  coordination of suppliers  rationalization of distribution channels  establishment and documentation of business processes and procedures  and integration of various functions and groups of employees 
sonicblue may not successfully address these challenges 
sonicblue s future operating results will depend in large measure on its ability to implement operating  manufacturing and financial procedures and controls  that not only address the expansion of its operations but also the change in focus of its business from graphics chips and boards to consumer electronic products  improve communication and coordination among the different operating functions  integrate functions such as sales  procurement and operations  strengthen management information and telecommunications systems  and continue to hire additional qualified personnel in key areas 
sonicblue may be unable to manage these activities and implement these additional procedures  controls and systems successfully 
any failure to do so could cause sonicblue s short term and long term operating results to suffer 
sonicblue s quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  any of which could result in sonicblue s failure to achieve its revenue or profitability expectations 
sonicblue s quarterly and annual results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond sonicblue s control 
any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause sonicblue to fail to achieve its revenue or profitability expectations 
the failure to meet market expectations would likely cause a decline in sonicblue s stock price 
these factors include sonicblue s ability to develop  introduce  produce in volume quantities and market successfully new or enhanced products  sonicblue s ability to introduce and market products in accordance with market demand and short design cycles  changes in the relative volume of sales of various products with sometimes significantly different margins  market acceptance of and changes in demand for sonicblue s products  rapid changes in electronic commerce on which sonicblue or its customers may not capitalize or which erode sonicblue s current business base  gains or losses of significant customers  distributors or strategic relationships  unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders  the availability  pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for sonicblue s products  including flash memory  substantial disruption in sonicblue s suppliers operations  either as a result of natural disaster  equipment failure or other cause  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs  the timing of new technological advances  product announcements or introductions by sonicblue or by its competitors  product obsolescence and the management of product transitions and inventory  production delays  decreases in the average selling prices of products  rates of product return in excess of those forecasted or expected  seasonal fluctuations in sales  general consumer electronics industry conditions  including changes in demand and associated effects on inventory and inventory practices  and general economic conditions  including economic conditions in north america  europe and asia in particular  that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling 
some or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for sonicblue s products and its future operating results 
most of sonicblue s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
sonicblue may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could harm its quarterly operating results 
because the lead times of firm orders are typically short in the consumer products industry  sonicblue does not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty 
because of the above factors  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance 
the demand for sonicblue s products has historically been weaker in certain quarters  which makes it difficult to compare its quarterly results 
due to industry seasonality  demand for video  digital audio and other consumer electronic products is strongest during the fourth quarter of each year and is generally slower in the period from march through august 
this seasonality may become more pronounced and material in the future to the extent that a greater proportion of sonicblue s sales consist of sales into the retail mass merchant channel  sonicblue s net revenues become increasingly based on entertainment related products  including products such as its rio digital audio players  sensory science dual deck vcrs and combination dvd vcr units and replaytv digital video recorders  or to the extent sonicblue expands its european sales  it may experience relatively weak demand in the third calendar quarter due to historically weak summer sales in europe 
in addition  sonicblue generally ships more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with levels of shipment in the third month being higher towards the end of the month 
this pattern is likely to continue and makes future quarterly operating results less predictable 
because the consumer products market experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations  with more sales occurring toward the end of the year  sonicblue s quarterly results will be difficult to compare 
general economic conditions and political and military conditions associated with current worldwide conflicts and similar events may prevent consumers from purchasing sonicblue s products  which would harm its revenues 
sales of consumer electronic products have historically been dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
the slowdown in the united states economy may cause consumers to defer decisions to purchase sonicblue s products 
some analysts have predicted a further decline in the united states economy will result from the terrorist attacks in the united states and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of recent economic  political and social turmoil  consumers may reduce discretionary spending and may not purchase sonicblue s products 
the markets in which sonicblue operates are intensely and increasingly competitive  and if it is unable to compete successfully  its revenues could decline 
the converging internet  digital media  entertainment and consumer electronics markets in which sonicblue competes are intensely competitive and are likely to become more competitive in the future 
because of this competition  sonicblue faces a constant and increasing risk of losing customers to its competitors 
the competitive environment also creates downward pressure on prices and requires higher spending to address the competition  both of which tend to keep gross margins lower 
sonicblue believes that the principal competitive factors for its products are performance and quality  ability to conform and adapt to  or upgrade for  current and evolving industry standards  including audio formats  access to customers and distribution channels  reputation for quality and strength of brand  manufacturing capabilities and cost of manufacturing  price  product support  and ability to bring new products to the market in a timely manner 
many of sonicblue s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources 
some of these competitors may also have greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  greater market power and product breadth  lower cost structures and larger customer bases 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of sonicblue s principal competitors may have the advantage of producing their own component parts  and  therefore  benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
in some markets where sonicblue is a relatively new entrant  including digital audio or internet music players and digital video products  it faces dominant competitors that include apple digital audio players  compaq home digital audio players and digital audio players  com modems  creative technology under the name creative labs modems and digital audio players  handspring digital audio player add ons to pdas  gateway home network digital audio players  hp home digital audio players  kenwood home digital audio players  microsoft digital video recorders  motorola handheld consumer electronics  panasonic digital audio players  digital video recorders and combination tv dvd vcr players  philips digital audio players  home digital audio players  digital video recorders and home theater in a box solutions  pioneer home theater in a box solutions  rca digital video recorders  samsung digital audio players  digital audio player mobile telephones and combination dvd vcr players  sony home theater in a box solutions  consumer electronic music  digital audio players and digital video recorders  thompson multimedia digital audio players  tdk cd mp players and tivo digital video recorders 
some of sonicblue s products face a variety of competitive sources 
for example  digital audio players compete against traditional stereos and cd players 
in addition  the markets in which sonicblue competes are expected to become increasingly competitive as pc products support increasingly more robust multimedia functions and companies that previously supplied products providing distinct functions for example  companies today primarily in the sound  modem  microprocessor or motherboard markets emerge as competitors across broader or more integrated product categories 
sonicblue operates in markets that are highly cyclical and vulnerable to sharp declines in demand and average selling prices 
sonicblue operates in the digital media and consumer electronics markets 
these markets have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  significant downturns 
in the event of an extensive downturn  sonicblue would likely experience significantly reduced demand for its products and may be pressured to reduce average selling prices 
although sonicblue is changing its focus to concentrate on its digital media and consumer electronics businesses  substantially all of its revenues during and were derived from products sold for use in or with personal computers 
in the near term  sonicblue expects to derive most of its revenues from the sale of digital audio products  such as rio players  and video products  such as go video dual deck vcr s and combination dvd vcr units and replaytv digital video recorders 
changes in demand in digital media and consumer electronics markets could be large and sudden 
since retailers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if market growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted product transitions 
in these cases  the retailers may abruptly stop purchasing additional inventory from suppliers like sonicblue until the excess inventory has been used 
this suspension of purchases or any reduction in demand for sonicblue s products would negatively impact its revenues and financial results 
sonicblue may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in results of operations due to these general industry conditions 
if sonicblue is unable to continue to develop and market new and enhanced products  its average selling prices and gross margins will likely decline 
sonicblue must continue to develop new products in order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins 
as the markets for its products develop and competition increases  sonicblue anticipates that product life cycles will shorten and average selling prices will decline 
in particular  average selling prices and  in some cases  gross margins  for each of its products will decline as products mature 
a decline in selling prices may cause the net sales in a quarter to be lower than those of a preceding quarter or corresponding quarter in a prior year  even if more units were sold during that quarter than in the preceding or corresponding quarter of a prior year 
to minimize the effect of declining average selling prices  sonicblue must successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new higher end and higher margin products to market in time to meet market demand 
the availability of new products is typically restricted in volume early in a product s life cycle 
if customers choose to wait for the new version of a product instead of purchasing the current version  sonicblue s ability to secure the manufacture of sufficient volumes of these new products to meet customer demand will be limited 
if this happens  sonicblue s revenues and operating margins could be harmed 
if sonicblue fails to identify new product opportunities or develop and market new and enhanced products  it will not be able to compete successfully 
the markets for which sonicblue s products are designed are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
for example  the life cycles of the rio audio players typically range from to months 
if sonicblue fails to introduce new products successfully within a given time frame  sonicblue could lose revenues and market share 
further  continued failure to develop  introduce and market competitive new products that meet customer demands on time could also damage sonicblue s brand name  reputation and relationships with its customers and cause longer term harm to its financial condition 
sonicblue may not successfully enter the various product markets that it identifies 
in addition  the sale of new products may not become significant or profitable 
to succeed in this environment  sonicblue must anticipate the features and functionality that customers will demand 
sonicblue must then incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the design  performance  quality and pricing requirements of the digital media and consumer electronics markets in which it competes and the timing requirements of retail selling seasons 
sonicblue believes this will require continued significant expenditures for research and development activities 
sonicblue has in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and may experience similar delays in the future 
in the past  sonicblue s business was seriously harmed when it developed products that failed to achieve significant market acceptance  and  therefore  was unable to compete successfully in its markets 
this type of failure could occur again in the future 
sonicblue must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving channel inventory 
as new products are introduced  sonicblue attempts to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
there can be no assurance that product transitions will be executed without harming sonicblue s operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce sonicblue s revenues and harm sonicblue s competitive position 
sonicblue depends on a limited number of suppliers from whom it does not have a guarantee of adequate supplies  increasing the risk that a loss of or problems with a single supplier could result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
sonicblue obtains several of the components used in its products  including flash memory for its rio players and semiconductors  hard drives  program guide data and set top box compatibility information for its replaytv digital video recorders and service from single or limited sources 
if component manufacturers do not allocate a sufficient supply of components to meet its needs or if current suppliers do not provide components of adequate quality or compatibility  sonicblue may have to obtain these components from distributors or on the spot market at a higher cost 
sonicblue rarely has guaranteed supply arrangements with its suppliers  and suppliers may not be able to meet its current or future component requirements 
if sonicblue is forced to use alternative suppliers of components  it may have to alter its product designs to accommodate these components 
alteration of product designs to use alternative components could cause significant delays and reduce its production of the related products 
in addition  from time to time  sonicblue has experienced difficulty meeting certain product shipment dates to customers for various reasons 
these reasons include component delivery delays  component shortages and component quality deficiencies 
delays in the delivery of components  component shortages and supplier product quality deficiencies will likely continue to occur in the future 
these delays or problems have in the past and could in the future result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
also  in an effort to avoid actual or perceived component shortages  sonicblue may purchase more of certain components than it may otherwise require 
excess inventory resulting from over purchases  obsolescence or a decline in the market value of such inventory could result in inventory write offs  which would have a negative effect on sonicblue s financial results 
if sonicblue is unable to predict market demand for its individual products  and focus its inventories and development efforts to meet market demand  it could lose sales opportunities and experience declines in revenues 
sonicblue offers a variety of products within each product line or division 
in order to arrange for the manufacture of sufficient quantities of products and avoid excess inventories  sonicblue needs to accurately predict market demand for each product 
for example  if sonicblue predicted that consumers would purchase the rio volt and plans its manufacturing accordingly  but instead consumer demand is for the rio  sonicblue would have excess inventory of the rio volt and lost sales opportunities for the rio  as well as lost market share and brand confidence 
sonicblue expects that it will become even more difficult to forecast demand as it introduces and supports multiple products and product lines and as competition in the market for its products intensifies 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause problems in sonicblue s operations 
sonicblue may not be able to accurately predict market demand in order to properly allocate its manufacturing and distribution resources among its products 
as a result  sonicblue may experience declines in its revenues and lose  or fail to gain  market share 
demand for sonicblue s digital audio and video products may decrease if the same capabilities provided by its products become available in or as add ons to other personal electronics products 
a substantial portion of sonicblue s net sales in was derived from the sale of digital audio players 
there is a trend within the personal electronics industry for functionality from individual products to be integrated with other personal electronics products 
for example  samsung  fuji  handspring and others have developed or announced plans to develop personal electronic products  such as mobile telephones  digital cameras or pda plug ins that integrate digital audio functions  and in the digital video market  panasonic offers combination tv dvd vcr players  directtv offers satellite receiver set top boxes with tivo software installed  and sony and creative labs have announced hardware and software products that would give pcs some dvr functionality 
these products could significantly reduce the demand for sonicblue s products 
as a result of these trends of technology migration and product integration  sonicblue s success largely depends on its ability to continue to develop products that incorporate new and rapidly evolving technologies into its products 
sonicblue must continue to expand the scope of its research and development efforts to provide the latest in digital audio and video technology products  which will require that it hire and retain engineers skilled in these areas and promote additional coordination among its design and engineering groups 
alternatively  sonicblue may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to enable it to provide these functions 
this technology may not be available for license or purchase on terms acceptable to sonicblue  if at all 
sonicblue depends on third parties for the manufacture of its products 
sonicblue relies on independent subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and or test its products 
sonicblue procures its components  assembly and test services and assembled products through purchase orders  and it does not have specific volume purchase agreements with each of its subcontractors 
most of its subcontractors could cease supplying the services  products or components at any time with limited or no penalty 
if sonicblue needs to replace a key subcontractor  it could incur significant manufacturing set up costs and delays 
also  sonicblue may be unable to find suitable replacement subcontractors 
sonicblue s emphasis on maintaining low internal and channel inventory levels may exacerbate the effects of any shortage that may result from the use of sole source subcontractors during periods of tight supply or rapid order growth 
further  some of sonicblue s subcontractors are located outside the united states  which may present heightened process control  quality control  political  infrastructure  transportation  tariff  regulatory  legal  import  export  economic or supply chain management risks 
sonicblue faces competition for access to manufacturers and manufacturing capacity 
many of the companies competing with sonicblue for this capacity have longer operating histories and greater financial and market resources than sonicblue 
sonicblue may not be able to maintain access to adequate capacity of high quality manufacturing if its subcontractors choose to offer their services to other companies who can negotiate better terms due to their market presence  pay higher prices  engage more manufacturing capacity or offer other incentives 
as sonicblue develops new products  it will require manufacturing capacity to produce quantities to meet market demand 
if sonicblue is unable to obtain and maintain access to high quality manufacturing capacity for its existing and future products  it will not be able to fill distributor or customer orders  and its revenues will decline 
sonicblue s products could have defects or compatibility issues  which could be costly to correct and could result in the rejection of its products and damage to its reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
sonicblue s products could have design defects that could cause them to malfunction 
product components may contain undetected errors or bugs when first supplied to sonicblue that  despite testing by sonicblue  are discovered only after sonicblue s products have been installed and used by customers 
from time to time  sonicblue has become aware of problems with components  product designs and other defects 
errors or defects in sonicblue s products may arise in the future  and  if significant or perceived to be significant  could result in rejection of sonicblue s products  product returns or recalls  damage to sonicblue s reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims 
errors or defects in sonicblue s products could also result in product liability claims 
sonicblue includes  or bundles  internally developed and third party software  including operating systems  with its hardware products 
for example  the software included in its replaytv digital video recorders is responsible for the products user interface and directs certain product functions 
also  sonicblue includes software with its rio players that the purchaser may use to download and store mp or wma files on the player 
the software products and sonicblue s hardware products are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
sonicblue has distributed updates to rio players in the past when required to improve sound quality or to correct minor audio problems and to its replaytv digital video recorders to improve functionality 
sonicblue generally provides warranties for its retail products allowing the return or repair of defective products 
despite testing by sonicblue  its suppliers or current or potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these errors could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance or product acceptance or in warranty returns 
losses  delays or damage to sonicblue s reputation due to product defects would likely harm sonicblue s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  new versions or upgrades to operating systems  independent software vendor titles or applications may require upgrades to the personal computer software products sonicblue bundles with its hardware products  or the software products that purchasers of sonicblue s products may obtain from other sources such as the internet  to maintain compatibility with the new versions or upgrades 
the sources for the software sonicblue bundles  or the other sources for purchasers of sonicblue s products to obtain software  may not be successful in developing new versions  upgrades or enhancements to their software products 
if producers of software experience delays or are unable to maintain compatibility with new audio formats  operating systems and independent software vendor titles or applications  the demand for sonicblue s products and sonicblue s reputation could suffer 
loss of sales and damaged reputation could harm sonicblue s revenues and profitability 
sonicblue is subject to risks relating to product returns and price protection  which could limit sonicblue s revenues 
sonicblue often grants limited rights to customers and distributors to return unsold inventories of its products in exchange for new products  also known as stock rotation 
also  some of sonicblue s retail customers may accept returned products from their own retail customers 
these products are then returned to sonicblue for credit 
sonicblue has in the past experienced a significant percentage of returns of its rio players 
sonicblue estimates stock rotation  warranty and other returns and accrues reserves for such costs at the time of sale 
sonicblue also often grants price protection on unsold inventory  which allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotional expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on sonicblue s operating results 
further  in this environment  high channel inventory levels may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin 
consequently  in taking steps to bring its channel inventory levels down to a more desirable level  sonicblue may cause a shortfall in net sales during one or more accounting periods 
these efforts to reduce channel inventory might also result in price protection charges if prices are decreased to move product out to final consumers  having a further adverse impact on operating results 
any estimates  reserves or accruals may be insufficient and any future price reductions or product returns may seriously harm its operating results 
sonicblue depends on sales through distributors and retailers 
if relationships with or sales through distributors or retailers decline  its operating results will be harmed 
sonicblue sells its products through a network of domestic and international distributors  and directly to major retailers mass merchants 
sonicblue s future success is dependent on the continued viability and financial stability of its customer base 
retail channels historically have been characterized by rapid change  including periods of widespread financial difficulties and consolidation and the emergence of alternative sales channels  such as direct mail order  telephone sales and electronic commerce on the worldwide web 
sonicblue may be unable to retain its retailers or distributors 
in addition  sales to any particular retailer or distributor may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the loss of  or a reduction in  sales to any of sonicblue s key retail or distribution customers as a result of changing market conditions  competition or customer credit problems could materially and adversely affect its operating results 
likewise  changes in distribution channel patterns  such as increased electronic commerce via the internet and increased use of mail order catalogues  could affect sonicblue in ways not yet known 
sonicblue s ability to market and distribute its products depends in part upon its current and future relationships with original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and other strategic partners to market and distribute sonicblue s products under their own brand names 
in addition to direct distributors of sonicblue s products  sonicblue also depends upon oems and other strategic partners to market and distribute its products 
for example  sonicblue has licensed the replaytv technology to panasonic  which has incorporated the technology into its showstopper dvrs 
if sonicblue is unable to obtain and maintain relationships with oems and strategic partners  it may not be able to increase sales of its products and achieve market acceptance  and its revenues may decline 
sonicblue relies on intellectual property and other proprietary information that may not be adequately protected and that may be expensive to protect 
the markets in which sonicblue competes are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
sonicblue relies on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
if sonicblue is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property  its business may suffer from the piracy of its technology and the associated loss of sales 
also  the protection provided to sonicblue s proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions  many of which offer less protection than the united states  may not be sufficient to protect its technology 
it is common in the personal electronics and internet device industries for companies to assert intellectual property infringement claims against other companies 
therefore  sonicblue s products may also become the target of infringement claims 
these infringement claims or any future claims could cause sonicblue to spend significant time and money to defend its products  redesign its products or develop or license a substitute technology 
sonicblue may be unsuccessful in acquiring or developing substitute technology and any required license may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  an adverse result in litigation could require sonicblue to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale  offer for sale and importation of infringing products  or discontinue the use of certain processes 
any of these events could materially harm sonicblue s business 
litigation by or against sonicblue could result in significant expense and could divert the efforts of its technical and management personnel  regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
however  even if claims do not have merit  sonicblue may be required to dedicate significant management time and expense to defending itself if it is directly sued  or assisting its customers in their defense of these or other infringement claims pursuant to indemnity agreements 
this could have a negative effect on sonicblue s financial results 
sonicblue may not be able to attract  retain or integrate key personnel  which may prevent it from succeeding 
sonicblue may not be able to retain its key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future 
sonicblue s success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel 
the loss of services of any of the key members of sonicblue s management team or its failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale  decreasing production and harming its financial results 
in addition  the competition to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical personnel  such as engineers  as well as qualified sales and operations personnel  is intense 
sonicblue has at times experienced difficulty recruiting qualified software and hardware development engineers 
sonicblue depends on a limited number of third party developers and publishers that develop software products that will operate with and fully utilize the capabilities of its rio players 
only a limited number of software developers are producing software that enables the download and use of digital audio players 
sonicblue does not create the software that is required to download or convert from cds music to run on its players but bundles third party software with its players 
if sonicblue is not able to license and bundle the software  or if users are not otherwise able to obtain software free of charge or at an acceptable price  then demand for sonicblue s digital audio players will decline 
likewise  difficult to use or defective software could negatively impact sonicblue s product sales and revenues 
sonicblue has exposure to international markets 
international sales accounted for of sonicblue s net sales 
in addition  a substantial proportion of sonicblue s products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
as a result  sonicblue is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the price in local currencies of sonicblue s products in foreign markets or increase the cost of components purchased by sonicblue  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  potentially longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax treatment  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in the past  sonicblue has experienced an adverse impact associated with the economic downturn in asia that contributed to decreases in net sales 
in addition  sonicblue s international operations are subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
the people s republic of china and taiwan have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing strained relations  and a worsening of relations or the development of hostilities between them could disrupt operations at the manufacturing facilities of sonicblue s subcontractors and affect its asian customers 
sonicblue has a significant level of debt  which may harm its ability to obtain additional financing or adversely affect its liquidity 
if the company is unable to generate or otherwise obtain sufficient funds  its financial condition and operations may be harmed 
at december   sonicblue had total debt and other liabilities outstanding of million 
the degree to which sonicblue is leveraged could harm its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes and could make sonicblue more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
sonicblue s significant leverage could also adversely affect its liquidity  as a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  sonicblue could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to meet such debt service requirements 
if sonicblue is unable to raise sufficient funds for working capital needs  it may not be able to fund product development and expansion  take advantage of future opportunities  meet its existing debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events or needs 
sonicblue may also be required to consider curtailing its operations significantly or to seek arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require sonicblue to relinquish significant rights to products  technologies or markets 
minority investments could adversely affect sonicblue s liquidity and earnings 
sonicblue holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus 
some of these investments are in research and development  start up or development stage companies or companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as going concerns 
as a result  sonicblue may be called upon under contractual or other terms to provide funding for operations of these companies and may share in their losses 
further adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in sonicblue incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of its investments 
sonicblue may pursue strategic acquisitions and could fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
sonicblue has engaged in acquisitions in the past  including its recent acquisitions of sensory science and replaytv  and expects to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the future that could provide additional product or services offerings  technologies or additional industry expertise 
any proposed or future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products  diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and management teams 
sonicblue could fail to integrate the operations  personnel or products that it may acquire in the future 
if sonicblue fails to successfully integrate acquisitions or achieve any anticipated benefits of an acquisition  its operations and business could be harmed 
system failures  interruptions to the replaytv service or product defects may have a negative impact on sonicblue s revenues  damage its reputation and decrease its ability to attract new viewers 
sonicblue s ability to provide high quality products  service and customer support is critical to its success because consumers of television related products are not accustomed to  and may not accept  interruptions in their television service 
sonicblue s network  communications hardware and other operating systems for the replaytv service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the replaytv service may reduce sonicblue s revenues and profits 
in addition to placing increased burdens on sonicblue s engineering staff  service outages will create numerous customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by sonicblue s or its partners customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage sonicblue s reputation and brand 
in addition  any delivery by sonicblue of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm sonicblue s credibility 
for example  the hard disk used in the replaytv enabled digital video recorder was originally designed for use in personal computers  and as a result exhibits behaviors that are viewed as typical and minimally disruptive when using a personal computer  but may result in the viewer momentarily facing a black television screen when using the replaytv service 
any errors and product defects can result in delays in releasing new versions of replaytv digital video recorders  affect system uptime  result in returns and significant warranty and repair costs and cause customer relations problems 
correcting errors in software and hardware design requires significant time and resources  which could delay future product releases and affect market acceptance of replaytv digital video recorders 
sonicblue needs to safeguard the security and privacy of replaytv viewers confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm sonicblue s reputation and brand and could result in lawsuits 
the replaytv digital video recorder collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that viewers may consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that sonicblue uses to protect this data could harm sonicblue s reputation and expose it to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems sonicblue uses to protect its viewers confidential information 
sonicblue may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
viewers may be concerned about the use of personal information gathered by the replaytv digital video recorder 
sonicblue does not release this data to third parties  and sonicblue is committed to complying with all privacy laws and to protecting the confidentiality of its viewers 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for personal television and replaytv products 
in addition  privacy concerns or breaches  or consumers dissatisfaction with any privacy policy sonicblue may adopt  could reduce demand for replaytv products  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm sonicblue s reputation and business 
one of sonicblue s recently announced products is the subject of a copyright infringement claim 
if this or future claims against sonicblue s products are decided against sonicblue  sales of sonicblue s products and its revenues could decrease 
in october and november  a group of entertainment companies filed suit against sonicblue to prevent shipment of the replaytv so long as the product includes features that those companies allege would result in violations of the entertainment companies video programming copyrights 
litigation may be costly and can divert the efforts of management 
furthermore  sonicblue may be forced to delay the release  or eliminate certain features of  the replaytv  which could result in decreased sales of the product and a negative impact on sonicblue s revenues 
sensory science  acquired by sonicblue in june  has designed and markets its dual deck vcrs and combination dvd vcrs for use as full featured videocassette recorders 
the marketing literature and owner manuals caution consumers that the dual deck vcr should not be used in a manner that infringes on the rights of owners of copyrighted material 
however  sonicblue cannot predict the likelihood that distribution of current or future dual deck vcrs or dvd vcr models will be challenged 
federal legislation affecting all vcrs was passed in october  commonly referred to as the digital millennium copyright act 
as a result  sensory science modified the operations of its dual deck vcrs sold after april  so that the vcrs would recognize a type of anticopying signal to prevent consumers from making a usable copy of videotapes with that type of signal 
however  models purchased prior to april continued to operate as originally designed for the lifetime of the vcr 
sonicblue is unable to determine what the effect of this or future required modifications may be on future sales of dual deck vcrs or combination dvd vcrs 
sonicblue is a party to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial impact on sonicblue 
since november  a number of complaints have been filed in federal and state courts seeking unspecified damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased shares of sonicblue s common stock at various times between april   and november  the complaints name as defendants sonicblue  certain of its officers and former officers  and certain directors of sonicblue  and deloitte touche  the company s former auditors  and assert that they violated federal and state securities laws by misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about sonicblue s business

sonicblue has answered that complaint

the derivative settlement calls for the defendants to contribute to the settlement their respective benefits under certain directors and officers insurance policies in an amount of approximately million which  net of attorneys fees and litigation costs  would be paid to sonicblue 
both settlements are contingent on satisfying certain conditions  including court approval 
the total net cost of these settlements to sonicblue  net of insurance  is expected to approximate million

the plaintiffs alleged that diamond and the other defendants made various material misrepresentations and omissions during the class period 
the parties have tentatively agreed to settle this matter  subject to final documentation and court approval  for a payment of million 
sonicblue funded million of the settlement on november  sonicblue previously accrued this amount in connection with the merger with diamond 
sonicblue believes that diamond s insurance covers the remaining million of the settlement  diamond s insurers have funded that amount into the settlement  although one of these insurers has served a notice of arbitration disputing its obligation to pay million of the million 
the contesting insurer maintains that indemnification of its share of the settlement is barred by virtue of a recent california appellate decision 
sonicblue has been defending the arbitration vigorously 
the matter is being briefed  and a preliminary conference is scheduled for april c sales  inc filed suit against sonicblue on october   in the harris county houston  texas district court

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk sonicblue s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and its convertible subordinated notes 
our investment portfolio principally consists of short term fixed income securities and derivative holdings 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities  and by limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
sonicblue does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio except as related to its umc shares  as discussed below and due to the nature of its investments  does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by potential changes in interest rates 
at december   the market value of these investments  which were all classified as cash equivalents  approximated cost 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at december   consisted of approximately million in cash and million invested in short term money market accounts that yield between and interest 
in september  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes mature in october interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into sonicblue s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
during  million in notes were converted into common stock 
the notes are redeemable at the option of sonicblue at a redemption price of of their principal amount 
the market value of the convertible subordinated notes at december   and was approximately million and million  respectively 
equity price risk sonicblue s largest financial asset is its investment in umc shares  which are traded on the taiwan stock exchange 
the market price of umc s stock is subject to volatility due to general market conditions  including changes in the semiconductor industry and the taiwanese market  as well as actual or anticipated changes in umc s business prospects or quarterly or yearly operating results 
because the umc shares are sonicblue s largest asset  when the price per share of umc s stock increases or declines  the price of sonicblue s common stock on the nasdaq national market tends to follow changes in umc s stock price 
fluctuations in the price of sonicblue common stock caused by changes in umc s stock price may or may not reflect sonicblue s actual or anticipated business prospects or quarterly results 
also  fluctuations in umc s stock price may cause fluctuations in sonicblue s stock price when there is no material news regarding sonicblue or any change in its results 
future fluctuations in the value of sonicblue s umc shares could negatively affect sonicblue s financial condition 
during  we sold a portion of our umc holdings  aggregating approximately million shares  in several derivative transactions 
in connection with the sales of those umc holdings  we purchased a series of call option collars on umc stock with an aggregate notional amount of million shares 
these transactions provided sonicblue funds from the sale of the shares while allowing us to participate in future increases in the value of umc shares  if any  through a series of call option collars 
the fair value of these instruments was million as of december   and is included in short term investments 
these instruments are marked to market 
these instruments have terms between one and three years and have a maximum potential value totaling million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk sonicblue invoices its customers in us dollars for all products 
sonicblue is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the local currency of the foreign location in order to centralize the foreign exchange risk with the parent company 
to date this risk has not been material 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s financial statements for fiscal and was not material 
the company has not entered into hedging transactions or activities
