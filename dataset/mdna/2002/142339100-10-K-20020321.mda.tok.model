item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
carlisle companies incorporated reported sales of billion in  up  or million  from sales of billion 
increased sales in the construction materials segment and from acquisitions were the primary contributors to the year over year sales increase 
sales volumes at many carlisle companies were adversely affected by reduced customer demand throughout the year 
in  sales increased or million  primarily as the result of acquisitions completed during the year and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in net earnings in were million  or per share  compared to net earnings of million  or per share diluted 
current year results include a million or per share after tax restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of after factoring out the effect of the restructuring charge  net earnings from operations were million or per share diluted 
net earnings of million in were slightly above net earnings of million 
margin pressures caused by competitive pricing and increased material costs adversely affected results 
the disappointing results in were primarily caused by steep declines in demand in many of the markets served by carlisle 
lower earnings were experienced at most of the carlisle operations throughout the year as management reduced production at several manufacturing operations to control inventory levels 
unabsorbed fixed overhead due to lower levels of production and pricing pressure to maintain market share also contributed to the decrease in earnings 
during  carlisle completed six acquisitions 
these acquisitions were stork friesland bv and siersema sheffers bv  both dutch based designers and sellers of evaporators and spray dryers for milk powder processing  ecostar  inc  a provider of synthetic roofing tiles for the steep slope roofing market  wincanton engineering ltd  a uk based designer and manufacturer of processing equipment for the food  dairy  and beverage industries  connecting devices  inc  a designer and manufacturer of rf microwave connectors and cable assemblies serving the wireless  internet infrastructure and optoelectronic switch markets  and the dayco industrial power transmission business of mark iv industries  a manufacturer of transmission belts and accessories used by industrial customers to transfer power from motors and engines to motive and stationary drive systems 
in  carlisle completed ten acquisitions and established three joint ventures 
these acquisitions were dynair  inc  a canadian manufacturer of duct supplies  tuchenhagen damrow  llc and kolding gruppen a s  global equipment suppliers to the cheese industry  dura ware co 
of america  inc  a manufacturer of commercial cookware and servingware  extract technology limited  a uk based biotech pharmaceutical systems provider  consumer tire and wheel division of titan international  inc  expanding product offerings to the lawn and garden markets  process controls engineering  a designer of control systems for the cheese industry  unitrek corporation  a manufacturer of microwave and radio frequency cable assemblies  bontech a s  a danish designer of spray dryers and fluid bed dryers for the dairy industry  zimmer corporation  a supplier of cheese and whey processing equipment  and red river manufacturing  a specialty trailer manufacturer 
in addition  the company entered into the following joint ventures icopal a s  europe s leading commercial roofing systems provider  moodyparts  a distributor of spare parts for processing equipment  and carlisle beijing  a chinese manufacturer of membrane roofing and waterproofing products 
operating segments carlisle has expanded its segment reporting for the year  and will disclose information for five reportable segments and a sixth classification of general industry all other 
previous reporting included three identifiable segments and a fourth classification of general industry all other 
the new reporting structure includes construction materials  industrial components  specialty products  automotive components  transportation products  and general industry all other 
the operations previously reported in the construction materials segment and automotive components segment remain the same 
the industrial components segment includes carlisle tire wheel company and carlisle power transmission 
carlisle industrial brake friction and motion control  previously in the industrial components segment  are now reported in the specialty products segment 
tensolite  previously reported in the industrial components segment  is now included in the general industry all other segment 
the new transportation products segment includes trail king industries and walker transportation 
these operations were previously reported in the general industry all other segment 
the new segment reporting structure more closely reflects how carlisle s management evaluates the operations to make decisions and assess performance 
construction materials segment sales of million in grew over sales of million 
the increase was across most product lines with significant growth noted in shipments of rubber roofing membrane and accessories  thermoplastic polyolefin tpo roofing membrane  insulation  and sales generated through the acquisition of ecostar 
carlisle coatings waterproofing continued to show improvement in sales of their adhesive tape and sealant products 
in  segment sales were flat over sales of million as a result of the soft commercial roofing market 
segment earnings were up in to million  from million in higher sales volume and additional sales of higher margin specialty products helped offset the unfavorable impact of increased sales of lower margin products 
in segment earnings of million were slightly below earnings of million  and reflected increased raw material prices  as well as a change in product mix 
industrial components segment sales of million in increased over million in carlisle s third quarter purchase of the dayco industrial power transmission business  renamed carlisle power transmission  accounts for the increase in sales as this operation generated million in net sales and million in gross profit during the last four months of carlisle tire wheel experienced soft demand throughout the year in its lawn and garden markets and took appropriate steps to reduce production to bring inventories in line with sales demand 
in segment sales increased over sales of million and were primarily as a result of the acquisition of titan s consumer tire and wheel division and increased sales in most markets supplied by carlisle tire wheel 
segment earnings of million in were down from earnings of million 
although the acquisition of carlisle power transmission was accretive in  earnings in this segment fell due to extremely difficult market conditions and much lower production levels 
also contributing to the lower earnings was intense competitive pressure requiring price concessions to maintain market share 
although the company implemented cost reduction programs and realigned manufacturing facilities  these actions could not offset the impact of decreased production and lower selling prices 
segment earnings in were above as the result of acquisitions and sales volume increase 
the addition of carlisle power transmission to the industrial components segment provides the platform to improve sales growth  reduce overall cost  and improve customer satisfaction 
the sales  manufacturing  and distribution functions of this business are extremely similar to those of carlisle tire wheel and will lead to an efficient and timely integration of shared resources within these two operations 
steps are already underway to improve sales coverage  share production and distribution facilities and move both companies to one erp system 
specialty products net sales of million were below total sales of million in sales at carlisle industrial brake friction were lower due to the general market conditions in both industrial friction and brake components 
this downturn was prevalent in the domestic markets as well as in markets throughout europe 
carlisle motion control sales were lower  with sales to original equipment manufacturers and distributors accounting for most of the decrease in volume 
distributor sales remained soft throughout as companies lowered their inventories in line with maintenance schedules 
segment sales in were slightly above and were in line with market conditions in the industry 
segment earnings of million in were below million in carlisle industrial brake friction earnings were below s level due to competitive pricing pressures  lower demand for heavy industrial components  and increased sales of lower margin consumer market products 
motion control earnings decreased from on lower sales volume  a cut back in production  and costs associated with the start up of operations at its new south hill  virginia facility 
segment earnings in were above results due to increased sales and lower manufacturing expense 
automotive components sales of million were down from total sales of million realized in this segment continued to experience an overall reduction in vehicle production build rates throughout the fourth quarter of was the fifth consecutive quarter over quarter reduction in north american vehicle production 
despite the robust vehicle sales reported in the latter part of  production volumes still trailed the prior year 
in  segment sales were down from record sales of million 
segment earnings of million were below net earnings of million 
the reduction in earnings was due primarily to the decrease in net sales  and lower production levels experienced throughout the year 
although overhead costs were reduced in  the necessary cut backs in production to maintain inventory levels in line with sales offset these savings 
earnings in were slightly higher than in due to operational improvements and efficiencies 
free cash flow remained strong in this business segment 
transportation products sales of million were down from and relate to the continued decline in demand in most of the markets served and competitive pricing required to maintain market share 
the significant fall off in demand for construction and live bottom trailers  and commercial and dump trailers was the major reason for the decrease in the decrease in segment sales from was the result of the general weakness in the industry coming off of record sales in segment earnings in of million decreased from million in caused by price discounting across most product lines  unabsorbed fixed overhead from reduced production levels  and higher utility costs 
as a result of the sharp fall off in demand the industry found itself in an overcapacity situation 
fierce competition forced manufacturers to slash prices to get available business 
this  coupled with much lower production levels  accounted for the deterioration in earnings 
segment earnings in were below as the result of lower sales and production volume experienced the second half of general industry all other the general industry segment sales in of million were above net sales of million 
acquisitions completed at carlisle systems equipment and tensolite explain the sales growth 
carlisle systems equipment expanded its leadership position in the sale of milk powder processing equipment and processing equipment for the food  dairy and beverage industries 
carlisle foodservice sales declined in as the result of the deepening recession and a fall off in business travel and tourism 
in  segment sales were above sales of million 
acquisitions completed at each of the businesses in this segment accounted for most of this sales growth 
segment earnings of million in were down from million in lower sales and margin pressures more than offset earnings from acquisitions 
sales declines at carlisle systems equipment s johnson truck bodies and the resulting production cut backs were primarily responsible for the earnings decrease at this operation 
carlisle foodservice margins were lower due to decreased sales volume following the september   attacks and production cutbacks needed to bring inventories in line with sales 
lower earnings at tensolite were driven by the slowdown in high technology electronics and telecommunications markets and the corresponding cut backs in production resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption 
segment earnings of million in increased from million in and was the direct result of acquisitions 
financial results gross margin  expressed as a percent of sales  represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
these margins decreased from in  to in  and in the decline in the last two years reflects the competitive marketplace  slightly higher raw material costs  and the unfavorable overhead absorption due to production cut backs at most of the operations 
the sagging economy in the last two years created extremely competitive pricing  requiring price concessions to maintain market share 
this  coupled with reduced production to maintain inventories in line with sales projections contributed to the decline in gross margins 
selling and administrative expense  expressed as a percent of sales  declined from in to in  but increased to in although cost control remains a priority and measures were taken in to reduce selling and administrative expense  the decline in sales at many of the carlisle operations and increased goodwill amortization exceeded cost reductions 
total costs excluding the restructuring charge which include raw material  manufacturing  selling and administrative  and research and development costs expressed as a percent of total sales  increased to in  from in  and in the increase was mainly the result of unabsorbed fixed overhead costs caused by reduced production levels at many carlisle operations 
the increase in total costs in was primarily due to raw material price increases and declining market demand in the latter part of the year 
interest expense  net increased to million in from million in  due to the increased level of debt incurred to finance acquisitions  but was partially offset by slightly lower overall interest rates 
interest expense  net increased to million from million in the increase in debt levels throughout was the result of completing a record number of acquisitions during the year 
income taxes  for financial reporting purposes  decreased in to an effective tax rate of compared to in  and in the continued successful implementation of various foreign and state tax strategies was responsible for this improvement 
receivables  of million declined from million in the decrease in receivables is associated with the implementation of a million accounts receivable securitization program with the proceeds of million being used to repay bank debt 
without giving effect to this program  receivables would have increased to million as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter and the impact of acquisitions completed in the level of receivables represented a decrease from levels and was in line with the sales decline realized in the fourth quarter and the focus on reducing days outstanding 
inventories  valued primarily by the last in  first out lifo method  were million  an decrease from the year end level of million 
almost all of the carlisle operations reduced inventory in in order to bring inventories in line with sales demand 
in  inventory increased from s level due primarily to higher inventory at carlisle tire wheel in preparation for the spring selling season  and at carlisle foodservice as the result of acquisitions completed in capital expenditures totaled million in  a increase from million in most of the capital investments were to expand capacity for the manufacture of heavy duty friction products  tpo roofing membrane  and coating and adhesive products 
in addition  the company completed the expansion of its facilities in china and trinidad 
in  the major expenditures were to expand production capacity in china and trinidad for tire and wheel assemblies  equipment to manufacture tpo roofing membranes  specialty trailers and processing equipment 
capital expenditures of million in were million higher than and were primarily driven by investments in production capacity in china and trinidad for tire and wheel assemblies  as well as plant and equipment to manufacture tpo roofing membranes  specialty trailers and processing equipment 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase is due primarily to management s focus on reducing working capital as evidenced by the million decrease in receivables  net of the affect of acquisitions and the company s accounts receivable securitization program  and the million decrease in inventories  net of acquisitions 
cash used in investing activities was million in  a decrease of million versus million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in acquisitions and million of proceeds from the sale of carlisle s remaining interest in its perishable cargo business and other property and equipment  partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared with million in net proceeds from debt decreased by million in as the unprecedented levels of acquisitions in the prior year had required increased borrowings in acquisitions in were funded largely by cash generated by operations supplemented by borrowings under carlisle s credit facilities 
in june of  carlisle amended its credit facilities to provide the company with the flexibility to implement the aforementioned million accounts receivable securitization program 
the amendment of the facility also resulted in an increase in available credit from million to million 
carlisle also maintains with certain credit providers million of uncommitted lines of credit and a million committed line of credit 
carlisle believes that its uncommitted and committed facilities are reliable and cost effective sources of liquidity 
as of december   there was million available under its credit facility and million available under its committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
master lease agreements are also utilized when they are considered economically favorable 
at december   the securitization program was utilized for the amount of eligible trade receivables at million 
eligibility of the trade receivables for sale under the program is dependent upon the credit profiles of carlisle s customers  collection rates and other characteristics of the receivables 
carlisle believes that its operating cash flows  credit facilities  accounts receivable securitization program  uncommitted and committed lines of credit and leasing programs provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund ongoing operations  expand existing lines of business and make strategic acquisitions 
however  the ability to maintain existing credit facilities and access the capital markets can be impacted by economic conditions outside the company s control 
the cost to borrow and capital market access can be impacted by debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage  funds from operations and various leverage ratios 
market risk carlisle is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates and market values of its debt instruments 
it is the company s objective to manage this exposure to reduce volatility of cash flows  impact on earnings and to lower its cost of capital 
in  the company executed a million notional amount fair value hedge in the form of an interest rate swap to hedge exposure associated with its fixed rate debt 
in addition  a second million notional amount interest rate swap was executed to hedge the cash flows for a portion of its variable rate date outstanding under the credit facilities 
both the fair value hedge and the cash flow hedge are deemed effective at december  the company s international operations are exposed to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
carlisle monitors this risk  but currency hedges have not been executed as this valuation risk is considered minimal 
environmental carlisle management recognizes the importance of the company s responsibilities toward matters of environmental concern 
programs are in place to monitor and test facilities and surrounding environments and  where practical  to recycle materials 
carlisle has not incurred material charges relating to environmental matters in or in prior years  and none are currently anticipated 
backlog backlog was million at december  compared to million in the increase is attributable to acquisitions completed in excluding acquisitions the backlog was million 
restructuring in the first quarter  the company recorded a million after tax or 
per share  restructuring charge 
the million after tax restructuring charge is primarily composed of costs related to exiting and realigning facilities in the automotive components and specialty products segments that have not and are not forecast to perform at our standard 
approximately million after tax of the total charge is related to machinery  equipment  and goodwill write offs 
the remainder represents anticipated cash expenses from involuntary employee terminations and other restructuring costs 
the company expects the future savings of reduced depreciation and employee expense to approximate million  or per share  on an annual basis 
during  the company terminated approximately employees and paid approximately million for involuntary termination benefits 
these payments have been charged against the restructuring liability established in the first quarter of the company anticipates the remaining actions required to exit and realign these operations will be completed by the end of the first quarter critical accounting policies carlisle s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of carlisle s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  estimates of reserves for receivables and inventory  valuation of long lived assets and investments  impairment of goodwill  deferred taxes  and employee benefits to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved 
revenue recognition 
the substantial majority of carlisle s consolidated revenues are recognized when the goods are shipped 
approximately of revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method 
sales are recorded based on customer orders with fixed or determinable prices and when collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly or does not satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be negatively affected 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an accrual for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
valuation of long lived assets and investments 
carlisle periodically reviews the carrying value of our long lived assets and investments 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could affect our evaluations 
impairment of goodwill 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred taxes 
carlisle recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
employee benefit plans 
the determination of our obligations and expense for pension and other postretirement employee benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense
