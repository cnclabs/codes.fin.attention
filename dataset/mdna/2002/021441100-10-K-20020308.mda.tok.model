although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements contained in this report are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore there can be no assurance that such statements included in this report will be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved 
overview we design  manufacture  and market high performance  high density plds  intellectual property cores  and associated development tools 
plds are semiconductor chips that may be programmed on site using software tools that run on personal computers or engineering workstations 
user benefits include ease of use  lower risk  and fast time to market 
our products serve a wide range of markets  including telecommunication  data communication  electronic data processing  computer peripheral  and industrial applications 
we offer our products in three categories fpgas  which consist of our stratix  apex ii  apex  flex  acex  excalibur  and mercury products  general purpose cplds  which consist of our max and classic products  and low cost  masked devices  which consist of our hardcopy product 
we classify our products into the following categories 
all prior year data have been restated to reflect the following compositions n new products include apex ke  apex kc  apex ii  max b  acex k  excalibur  mercury  hardcopy  and stratix families n mainstream products include max a  max a  flex  flex ka  flex ke  and apex k families n mature and other products include classic  max  max s  max  flex  and flex k families  configuration and other devices  tools  and intellectual property critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
in  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and diminished demand for semiconductor products  we experienced a sharp decline in sales and recorded inventory charges of million related primarily to excess inventories 
these charges have been included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have modified our inventory model to reduce inventory carrying levels and minimize the risk of excess inventory charges in the future 
valuation of property  equipment  and intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this standard requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 

table of contents in  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of production and other equipment that has been abandoned or is being held for sale  as well as for the impairment of purchased intangible assets related to technology acquired in previous acquisitions but no longer being used  and the impairment of investments in development stage enterprises that are in financial difficulties 
these charges were classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
on january   sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets became effective 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
and requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
our adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and accounts receivable 
we place our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and by restricting our investments to highly rated securities 
diversification involves the use of management judgments and estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
we sell our products to distributors and oems throughout the world 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require collateral whenever deemed necessary 
we are highly dependent on our largest distributor  arrow  to sell our products in many locations across the world  particularly in north america where arrow is our only distributor 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems and end users provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
we defer recognition of revenue on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
dependence on wafer suppliers and other independent subcontractors we do not directly manufacture finished silicon wafers 
our strategy has been to purchase silicon wafers from independent wafer foundries 
we also depend on these wafer foundries to improve process technologies in a timely manner and to enhance our product designs and cost structure 
although there is presently good availability in the silicon market  semiconductor foundry capacity can become limited quickly and without much notice 
we cannot assure you that any future shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity will not result in production problems for us in the future 
we also depend on independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  for the testing and assembly of our semiconductor products 
any unfavorable economic conditions  political strife  prolonged work stoppages  natural or man made disasters  or power shortages in these countries  or other factors  may adversely affect the ability of our independent subcontractors to manufacture  test  and assemble our products  and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position  and cash flows 
results of operations sales sales were million in   million in  and million in sales declined in from and increased in from the decline in sales in compared to was primarily due to lower unit sales of our mature and mainstream products and lower average unit selling prices in all product categories 
the 
table of contents increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to higher unit sales in all product categories  which was partially offset by decreases in average unit selling prices 
sales by product category for   and were as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands new mainstream mature and other total sales sales of new products were million in  higher than sales of million 
sales of mainstream products were million  lower than sales of million 
sales of mature and other products were million  lower than sales of million 
our new and mainstream products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years 
these products have similar or improved features and comparable or higher densities than their predecessors 
as a result of increased customer demand for plds with higher densities and enhanced performance  we experienced a shift in sales to our newer products from our more mature products 
new products sales increased both as a percentage of total sales and in absolute dollars primarily due to strong design win momentum in our new products 
our management expects that sales for our new products will continue to increase in sales by market segment for   and were as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands communications electronic data processing computer industrial consumer other total sales as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by communication service providers that purchase our customers products  sales from the communications market segment decreased significantly in despite this decrease  we continued to generate the majority of our sales from the communications market segment  driven primarily by the telecommunication and networking sectors 
our management believes that the communications market segment will continue to drive the largest percentage of sales 
effective january   we adopted a new methodology for revenue classification by market segment 
the new classification includes communications  electronic data processing computer  industrial and automotive  and digital consumer 
the new methodology reflects reclassifications between segments and is consistent with industry analyst reports 

table of contents sales by geography for   and were as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands north america europe japan asia pacific total international total sales north america sales declined in from north america sales represented of total sales in compared to in and in the decreases  both in absolute dollars and in percentage of total sales  were primarily a result of unfavorable economic conditions that began to affect us in november beginning in november  we saw an inventory correction in our north american business driven primarily by an accumulation of inventory both at our customers and their subcontract manufacturers 
during  we experienced further declines in north america sales as a result of deteriorating end market demand experienced by our north american communications equipment customers 
international sales declined in from international sales represented of total sales in compared to in and in unfavorable economic conditions spread to europe and japan beginning in the second quarter of  resulting in a decline in sales in europe and a decline in sales in japan for compared to the fourth quarter of appears to be the bottom of this economic downturn  as we see increasing order strength and improved customer backlog 
our management expects that quarterly revenues will be flat or increase modestly starting in early  but we cannot assure you that this will occur 
if unstable and unfavorable economic conditions persist or worsen  or if a wider economic slowdown occurs  our future operating results could be further adversely affected 
in  north america sales grew from  while sales in europe grew  japan grew  and asia pacific grew 
major items in the statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows years ended december  cost of sales gross margin total research and development expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring and other special charges income loss from operations gain on sale of wafertech  llc interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in  in  and in the significant decrease in gross margin for was primarily a result of inventory charges taken during totaling million 
the inventory charges  which resulted from sharp declines in sales  related primarily to excess inventory provisioning for our apex ke  flex ke  and max a product families and assembly packaging materials 
in anticipation of 
table of contents continued strong demand and to improve availability of our apex ke and flex ke product families  we ordered wafers that were delivered in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of these wafers became excess to demand as a result of the sharp contraction in sales 
excluding the inventory charge  gross margin was for compared to for this decrease in gross margin was due to routine declines in selling prices coupled with fixed unit costs  owing to high inventory levels 
additionally  reduced factory activity has resulted in under absorbed manufacturing overhead 
in the fourth quarter of  we also started to engage in opportunistic deals and sold valued inventory at low prices  which resulted in a negative impact on our margins 
irrespective of the result of these potential opportunistic deals  our management expects that gross margins will decline gradually through the first half of  but will begin to increase in the second half of the year 
our management also expects that routine declines in selling prices will be at least partially offset by improved manufacturing overhead absorption as we ramp production for certain depleted finished goods  and by lower die costs resulting from improved yields and lower wafer prices 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in historically  the level of research and development expenses as a percentage of sales has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and wafers used in the development of new products 
we expect that  in the long term  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars primarily due to our efforts to develop new products 
research and development expenses include expenditures for labor  masks  prototype wafers  the amortization of deferred stock based compensation for employees engaged in research and development activities  and expenses for the development of process technology  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
despite unfavorable economic conditions  we continued to invest in the development of new products in order to maintain our competitive position 
excluding the million one time acquired in process research and development charge taken in  research and development expenses remained relatively flat in compared to research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily a result of increased headcount  additional spending on masks  prototype wafers  package development  and the development of our quartus ii software and excalibur embedded processor solutions 
during  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for the acquisitions of designpro inc and right track cad inc which is being amortized to research and development expenses over a period of three to four years 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation included in research and development expenses was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to invest in the development of new products  especially in our stratix  apex ii  hardcopy  mercury  and apex kc families  as well as in our excalibur embedded processor solutions  quartus ii software  and other future products 
our management expects these new products to be successful in the marketplace  however  the commercial success of these products depends on market acceptance of the use of the devices in high density designs 
we cannot assure you that any of our new products will achieve market acceptance 
some of our major achievements in and early are summarized below n we introduced our stratix device family  which we believe is the industry s largest and fastest pld 
stratix devices have relatively smaller die sizes while achieving high levels of integration with more memory  logic elements  and dsp functionality 
the new high performance stratix architecture  which enables block based design methodology  allows for easy integration of complex functions into a single pld 
n we began shipping our apex ii device family  a high performance  high density pld family for sopc applications 
our apex ii family incorporates enhancements to both the i o and memory structures  allowing designers to incorporate high level system functionality onto a single pld 
our apex ii epa  the latest device in the apex ii family  began shipping in december this device is the industry s first pld to use a micron all copper interconnect system  which provides greater performance versus traditional aluminum tungsten interconnect 
n we began shipping our hardcopy devices  which facilitate a seamless migration path from the largest plds to a hard  masked version  offering a low cost alternative for customers desiring high volumes 
hardcopy devices are offered to support high density apex ke  apex kc  apex ii  excalibur  and stratix devices 
we believe the combination of plds and hardcopy devices will deliver the benefits of fast time to market  flexibility  and lower costs that are important to customers in today s markets 

table of contents n we began shipping our arm based excalibur embedded processor solutions  which provide designers a reduction in overall development cost and accelerated time to market compared to asic solutions 
n we announced an enhancement of our nios soft core processor  which is one of our excalibur embedded processor solutions and enables engineers to easily integrate peripherals and implement entire systems onto a single pld 
n we began shipping our mercury device family  which integrates the functionality of a high speed transceiver assp with a high performance pld core engineered to support high bandwidth and rapid data transfer rates 
n we began shipping our apex kc device family  which utilizes copper for all layers of metal interconnect 
copper interconnect boosts performance and is thus appealing in high bandwidth  high performance applications 
n we released our quartus ii development software  which we believe delivers improved designer productivity and supports system level designs and integration with third party tools 
the latest version of quartus ii development software  which provides further improvement in design performance and reduces compile times  was available beginning in february despite the current unfavorable economic conditions  we will continue to focus our efforts on the development of new plds and hardware that utilize advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software 
we cannot assure you that we will accomplish our goals in the development and subsequent introduction of new products  that our new products will achieve market acceptance  that new manufacturing processes will be successful  or that our suppliers will provide us with the quality and quantity of wafers and materials we require 
we also cannot assure you that our new product introductions will be timely relative to product introductions by our competitors  which is critical in achieving market success 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  in  and million  or  in selling  general  and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions and incentive expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  and legal expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include costs related to the direct sales force and field application engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper selection of our products 
the customers then work with our distributors for order fulfillment and logistical requirements 
in  over of our sales are made through distributors 
despite the slight increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in compared to  the amount of spending has dropped steadily during the year 
the selling  general  and administrative spending in the fourth quarter of decreased from our peak spending in the first quarter 
the decrease was primarily due to spending control measures  including the restructuring program implemented during this restructuring program includes  but is not limited to  a worldwide workforce reduction mainly in administrative functions  the spin off of a design service center  northwest logic  inc  and the consolidation of excess facilities 
in addition  we settled our xilinx and lattice litigation 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will continue to slightly decline in absolute dollars as a result of reduced litigation expenses stemming from the settlement of the xilinx and lattice litigation and other spending control measures 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in compared to was mainly driven by increased headcount for sales  marketing  and administration personnel  higher advertising and legal expenses  and higher commission and incentive expenses associated with increased sales 
restructuring and other special charges during  we recorded restructuring and other special charges of million in connection with our plan to align our organization s cost structure with projected sales resulting from the unfavorable economic conditions and to reduce future operating expenses 
this restructuring program includes a worldwide workforce reduction  the spin off of northwest logic  the write down of certain equipment and intangible assets  the consolidation of excess facilities  and the 
table of contents termination of certain license agreements 
in addition  we settled our patent litigation with xilinx 
these charges were classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
a summary of the restructuring and other special charges is as follows restructuring liability as of in thousands total charges non cash charges cash payments december workforce reduction litigation settlement spin off of northwest logic impairment of production and other equipment impairment of investments and intangible assets consolidation of excess facilities and other total workforce reduction we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately employees primarily in administrative functions located mainly in our headquarters facility in san jose  california 
the workforce reduction resulted in a million charge relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 
additionally  we initiated cost reduction measures  which included a temporary reduction of executive officer pay by and the cancellation of employee merit increases 
we also reduced the number of temporary and contract workers and  starting in the first quarter of  did not replace voluntary attrition except for key positions 
litigation settlement in connection with the settlement of litigation with xilinx  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement and agreed to make a one time payment of million 
both companies also agreed to refrain from instituting further patent litigation between our two companies for the next five years 
spin off of northwest logic we completed the spin off of northwest logic to two of its employees in december northwest logic was a design service center that we acquired in the spin off resulted in the termination of employees 
we recorded a charge of million related primarily to stock based compensation of million for the acceleration of unvested stock options of terminated employees  as well as severance  fringe benefits  and the write off of certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities relating to northwest logic 
impairment loss on equipment  investments  and intangible assets we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of production and other equipment that has been abandoned or is being held for sale 
certain production equipment is now surplus to our requirements and marketed for sale 
we reclassified million from property and equipment to other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet to reflect our intention to sell these assets within the next twelve months 
the amount reclassified represents the estimated net realizable value of equipment that is being held for sale 
we also recorded a million charge resulting from the impairment of purchased intangible assets related to technology acquired in previous acquisitions but no longer being used  as well as investments in development stage enterprises that are in financial difficulties 
consolidation of excess facilities and other we recorded a charge of million resulting from the consolidation of excess facilities primarily related to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs  as well as other charges including the termination of certain license agreements 

table of contents we substantially completed the implementation of our restructuring program in amounts related to the termination of agreements and non cancelable leases will be paid over their respective terms through the third quarter of cash expenditures relating to workforce reductions will be paid by the first half of the restructuring liability  totaling million as of december   is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we expect that the reductions in legal expenses  depreciation  amortization  and labor expense resulting from the restructuring program and voluntary attrition will reduce our operating expenses by more than million on a quarterly basis 
these savings started to phase in during the second half of in process research and development during  we recorded a non recurring charge of million to in process research and development related to the acquisition of designpro and right track 
we determined this non recurring charge using valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry 
we immediately expensed this non recurring charge in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
as of december   we believe that the projections used in the valuations with respect to each acquisition are still materially valid  however  there can be no assurance that the projected results will be achieved 
income loss from operations loss from operations was million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million  or of sales  in and operating income of million  or of sales  in the decrease in operating income in was primarily due to a decline in sales as well as the inventory  restructuring  and other special charges taken in the increase in operating income in  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to improvements in gross margin and a decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased research and development expenses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income was million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in the decline in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances 
interest and other income consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
for the year ended december   interest and other income included a one time pre tax gain of million from the sale of the max family and our equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc excluding the one time gain  interest and other income was million  or of sales 
excluding the one time gain  the increase from to  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to an increase in interest income related to higher investment balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were for  for  and for excluding the inventory  restructuring  and other special charges taken in and a one time gain on the sale of wafertech  llc in  our effective tax rates were for  for  and for the reduction of the effective tax rate  as measured on this basis  over the three year period primarily resulted from a change in the geographic mix of income 
equity investment in june  we formed wafertech  llc  a joint venture company  with tsmc and several other partners to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in camas  washington 
wafertech began production of silicon wafers in october and achieved volume production in on december   we sold our ownership interest in wafertech to a subsidiary of tsmc for million in cash 
the one time pre tax gain on the sale of wafertech was million 
although we sold our equity interest in wafertech in december  we expect to continue utilizing wafertech as one of our suppliers of silicon wafers 
through december   we accounted for our investment under the equity method based on our ability to exercise significant influence over wafertech s operating and financial policies 
our equity in the loss of wafertech was million for and million for financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources year we ended with million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments available to finance our operating activities and future growth 
since our inception  we have used a combination of equity and debt financing and 
table of contents cash generated from operations to support our operating activities and capital expenditures  make acquisitions and investments  and repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
in  our primary cash usage included million for the repurchase our common stock  compared to million used in  and million used in we also used million for purchases of capital equipment in  compared to million in  and million in our management believes that capital expenditures will be significantly lower in compared to we also lease certain of our sales facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense amounted to million in we anticipate that our lease payments in will approximate we believe the available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and cash we expect to generate from operations will be adequate to finance our activities for at least the next year 
future minimum lease payments are as follows years ending december  in thousands thereafter total  cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted from million used for operating activities  million used for investing activities  and million used for financing activities 
our negative cash flow from operations was primarily attributed to our net loss  decreases in deferred income on sales to distributors  accounts payable  accrued compensation  and income taxes payable  and an increase in other current assets 
these items were partially offset by depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and decreases in inventories  accounts receivable  and deferred income taxes 
accounts receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at december  from days at december  the decrease in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding was primarily due to a decrease in billings to distributors  which resulted from a decrease in end customer sales as well as a reduction of distributor inventory to align with lower sales 
inventories decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was mainly due to inventory charges of million taken in in anticipation of continued strong demand and to improve availability of our apex ke and flex ke product families  we ordered wafers that were delivered in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of these wafers became excess to demand as a result of the sharp contraction in sales 
inventory months supply on hand was at december  and at december  our management has modified our inventory model to reduce inventory carrying levels to minimize the risk of excess inventory charges in the future 
cash payments in connection with the restructuring program were million since the inception of the program 
we expect that the reductions in legal expenses  depreciation  amortization  and labor expense resulting from the restructuring program and voluntary attrition will reduce our operating expenses by more than million on a quarterly basis 
these savings started to phase in during the second half of during  cash used for investing activities of million consisted of purchases of capital equipment  short term investments as well as long term investments 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees through various option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents year we ended with  million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from million provided by operating activities  million provided by investing activities  partially offset by million used for financing activities 
our positive cash flow from operations was primarily attributed to our net income  increases in income taxes payable  deferred income on sales to distributors  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a decrease in other current assets  the one time write off of acquired in process research and development  depreciation  and amortization as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
these items were partially offset by increases in inventories  deferred income taxes  and accounts receivable 
cash from operating activities was also offset by the gain of million on the sale of wafertech 
cash generated from investing activities of million consisted of cash proceeds of million from the sale of our equity interest in wafertech and net sales of short term investments of million 
these items were partially offset by cash payments for the acquisitions of designpro and right track for million and the purchase of certain long term investments 
in addition  we invested million primarily in land  manufacturing and data processing equipment and software  and building improvements in our headquarters and penang facilities 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees as well as cash proceeds received from the sale of put warrants 
employees the number of employees was  in   in  and  in  reflecting an increase of in and in from their respective preceding years 
impact of currency translation and inflation we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and transact our foreign sales in us dollars 
we have  in the past  entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase malaysian ringgits to meet a portion of our firm contractual commitments to be paid in ringgits 
the contract was settled in june as of december   we had no open forward contracts  however  we may enter into similar contracts from time to time to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
to date  inflation has not significantly impacted our financial results  however  we cannot assure you that inflation will not affect us materially in the future 
common stock repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   million shares were authorized for repurchase 
since the inception of the repurchase program in through december   we have repurchased a total of million shares 
all shares were retired upon acquisition

table of contents future results  risk factors in addition to other information contained elsewhere in this report  the following important factors  among others  have affected and  in the future  could affect our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
our financial results depend on our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the programmable logic industry is intensely competitive 
future operating results will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell complex semiconductor components and programming software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors  including xilinx and lattice 
we may not succeed in developing  manufacturing  or selling competitive products 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by asic vendors  we also indirectly compete in the asic market 
many of these vendors have substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in displacing asic vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
furthermore  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  our customers increasingly use standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the asic market  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our future success depends on our ability to define  develop  and sell new products 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid product obsolescence 
we continue to focus our efforts on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new products and manufacturing processes  that our products will achieve market acceptance  or that our processes will be successful 
if we do not successfully define  develop  and timely introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  for the supply and quality of our finished silicon wafers 
we depend significantly upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
our primary wafer supply arrangements are with two semiconductor vendors tsmc and sharp 
although there is presently good availability in the silicon market generally and from tsmc and sharp specifically  semiconductor foundry capacity can become limited quickly and without much notice 
furthermore  since only newer fabrication or substantially retrofitted facilities are able to manufacture wafers that incorporate leading edge technologies  any significant decrease in capacity of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain wafer supply for our newer products 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that any shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity will not result in production problems for us in the future 
in addition to sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity  we depend upon our foundry vendors to produce wafers at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely manner 
good production yields and timely delivery are necessary to meet customers demand for products and to maintain profit margins 
the manufacture of advanced cmos wafers is a highly complex process 
wafer production yields are dependent on a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced  and may experience from time to time  problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin production of new products  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
these difficulties can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
although our inventory levels are currently ample relative to demand  we have in the past experienced shortages in supply 
for example  from the fourth quarter of through the first half of  process control issues associated with volume ramp up at a wafer supplier resulted in low die yields on flex ka and flex ke products  
table of contents thereby leading to reduced product availability in these families 
as a result  we were unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels and in some cases could not meet end customer demand 
further  in the second quarter of  difficulties with a vendor s manufacturing process limited the availability of packaging material piece parts used in certain of our new and proprietary fineline bga  or ball grid array  packages  thereby causing limited production 
this in turn limited shipments of our new flex ke product family 
finally  production throughput times vary considerably among our wafer suppliers and among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products  which also may result in higher costs and lower product availability 
our management expects that  as is customary in the semiconductor business  to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we will continue to introduce new and established products using new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our stratix family will be manufactured on a micron  all layer copper interconnect process for which there is limited production history 
we will also continue to transition our fabrication process arrangements to larger wafer sizes and smaller circuit geometries 
such transitions entail inherent technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect yields  costs  and time of delivery 
to enhance our product designs and cost structure  we depend on all of our subcontractors  and especially our principal foundry partner  tsmc  to improve process technologies in a timely manner 
to ensure the continued supply of wafers  we may engage additional relationships and establish other sources of wafer supply for our products as such arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
if we engage alternative sources of supply  we may encounter start up difficulties 
also  shipments could be delayed significantly while such sources are qualified for volume production 
any significant delay caused by start up difficulties or foundry qualification could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
market conditions  including currency fluctuation  political strife  labor disruption  power shortages  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  or freight rates  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our foundry vendors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  in september  a major earthquake struck taiwan  resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life 
the earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at our primary vendor  tsmc  for several days and then only limited production began 
nearly two weeks passed before full production resumed  and a portion of the inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  for the testing and assembly of our semiconductor products 
independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  test and assemble our semiconductor products 
although these subcontractors have not recently experienced any serious work stoppages  the economic  social  and political situations in countries where certain subcontractors are located are unpredictable and can be volatile 
any unfavorable economic conditions  political strife  prolonged work stoppages  natural or man made disasters  or power shortages in these countries  or other factors that could adversely affect the ability of our independent subcontractors to manufacture  test  and assemble our products would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face significant future litigation expenses 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
we own numerous patents relating to various aspects of our products and technology and have a number of patent applications currently pending 
although our patents and patent applications may have value in discouraging competitive entry into our market segment  we cannot assure you that any valuable new patents will be granted to us  that our patents will provide meaningful protection from competition  or that we can rely on our intellectual property rights in developing additional products 
also  in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of inquiries received from third parties  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we cannot assure you that such licenses could be obtained  and  if obtainable  could be obtained on conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results 

table of contents finally  we have been a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party to lawsuits involving various types of claims  including  but not limited to  unfair competition and intellectual property matters 
legal proceedings tend to be unpredictable and costly and may be affected by events outside of our control 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights 
we also cannot assure you that third parties would not succeed in obtaining significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families  thereby adversely affecting our financial position or results of operations 
we depend on independent distributors to generate sales and fulfill our customer orders 
worldwide sales through independent distributors accounted for over of our total sales in we rely on a variety of independent distributors to assist us in creating customer demand  providing technical support and other value added services to our customers  filling customer orders  and stocking our products 
these distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial strength 
we are highly dependent on arrow in many locations across the world  particularly in north america where arrow is our only distributor 
while we have contractual relationships with all of our distributors  these contracts may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
any adverse impact on the ability of our independent distributors to assist us in marketing and selling our products for any reason would have a material adverse affect on our operating results and cash flows 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our total sales 
during each of the last two years  international sales constituted a significant portion of our total sales 
in  international sales constituted over of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic conditions in a specific country or region  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign currency weakness against the us dollar  adverse changes in tax laws  freight costs or interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  generally longer receivable collection periods  and natural or man made disasters in a specific country or region where we sell our products 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the importation or exportation of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future  or what  if any  effect such actions would have on our operating results 
our financial results are affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
it is currently experiencing a significant downturn as a result of diminished demand for semiconductor products  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
this economic downturn has reduced demand for our own products as well as raw materials and services provided by our key suppliers  thereby resulting in inventory charges of million in related primarily to excess inventory 
the reduction in overall industry demand has financially stressed certain of our subcontractors and has weakened their capital structures 
currently  we do not expect any disruption to our supply chain due to this economic downturn 
if these conditions in the semiconductor industry persist or worsen in the future  or if other unfavorable conditions occur  our future operating results could be further adversely affected 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions 
as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers  our sales have decreased during compared to the same period a year ago 
this downturn in customer demand resulted in excess inventory charges taken in additionally  we significantly reduced factory activity  which resulted in under absorbed manufacturing overhead 
anticipated declines in average selling prices  coupled with under absorbed manufacturing overhead  have reduced  and may continue to reduce  gross margins 
if economic conditions worsen  or if a wider economic slowdown occurs  our future operating results could be further adversely affected 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including n the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry n the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products n general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products n demand for our products n the pricing of our products n the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions n our inventory levels and product obsolescence n the scheduling  rescheduling  and cancellation of large orders by our customers n the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors n our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the foundries of tsmc or sharp n changes in manufacturing yields n adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates  or tax rates n litigation expenses incurred in connection with the defense of our intellectual property rights our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
our future success depends  in large part  upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and support employees  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the competition for such employees is intense and the loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price volatility and the price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the overall stock market  the prices of semiconductor stocks in general  and the price of our stock may continue to fluctuate greatly 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter variances in financial results  announcements of new products  new orders  and order rate variations by us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock prices for many high technology companies experience large fluctuations  which are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as a recessionary period or high interest rates  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million as of december  and  million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  we anticipate holding our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiaries and branch operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   our financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a material impact in the future
