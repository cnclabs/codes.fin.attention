derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
and its amendments sfas nos 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
additionally  the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instruments qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying transaction is terminated or completed  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria of sfas no 
is marked to market each period 
as of january   the adoption of the new standard resulted in derivative instruments reported on the balance sheet as liabilities of approximately million  an adjustment of approximately million to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which are gains and losses not affecting retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity  and a charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations

at december   the company s joint venture development partners had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans 
the company has recorded its proportionate share of these qualifying hedges on its consolidated balance sheet 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of million notional amounts range from million to million over the terms of the swaps at interest rates ranging from to maturing at various dates ranging from to with a net liability fair value of million 
as of december   there were approximately million in deferred losses  net  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
on december   the net derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately million and as a reduction to investment in unconsolidated entities of approximately million 
the company expects to recognize an estimated million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending december   of which million is related to the development joint venture swaps 
for the year ended december  as of january   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available on its lines of credit  of which million was restricted not available to be drawn 
after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs  the company s cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was approximately million and the amount available on the company s line of credit was million  of which million was restricted not available to be drawn 
part of the company s strategy in funding the purchase of multifamily properties  funding its properties in the development stage and the funding of the company s investment in joint ventures is to utilize its line of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or the net proceeds from the disposition of properties

the company s total debt summary  as of december   included debt summary as of december  millions weighted average rate secured  unsecured  total  fixed rate  floating rate total  above totals include total tax exempt unsecured revolving credit facility critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for impairment indicators 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
stock based compensation the company has chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding market value of the company s common shares on the date of grant  instead of statement no 
 which would result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock based compensation issued 
adjusted net income for the year ended december   adjusted net income ani available to common shares and op units decreased million as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ani available to common shares and op units increased million  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common shares to ani available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and adjusted net income amounts in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shares    net income allocation to minority interest operating partnership adjustments acquisition cost depreciation    amortization of goodwill   acquisition cost depreciation accumulated on sold properties  extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  ani available to common shares and op units basic  acquisition cost depreciation represents depreciation for the initial cost of the property  including buildings and furniture  fixtures and equipment and depreciation on capital improvements identified in the acquisition underwriting and incurred in the first twenty four months of ownership when the total cost exceeds  per unit 
adjusted net income represents net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including gains or losses from sales of real estate  plus acquisition cost depreciation  plus amortization of goodwill  minus the accumulated acquisition cost depreciation on sold properties  plus minus extraordinary items and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
depreciation associated with replacements and capital improvements is deducted in calculating ani 
the company believes that ani is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ani in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s calculation of ani may differ from the methodology for calculating ani utilized by other real estate companies and may differ  for example  due to variations among the company s and other real estate companies accounting policies for replacement type items and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
funds from operations for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common shares to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and funds from operations amounts in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shares    net income allocation to minority interest operating partnership adjustments depreciation amortization    net gain on sales of real estate    extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  impairment on furniture rental business  impairment on technology investments   ffo available to common shares and op units basic   includes   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the company s share of depreciation from unconsolidated properties

ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization after adjustments for partially owned properties and unconsolidated properties  plus minus extraordinary items  and plus the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies and may differ  for example  due to variations among the company s and other real estate companies accounting policies for replacement type items and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s unsecured line of credit 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  other assets  lines of credit  accounts payable and accrued expenses  rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of the company s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately million  or of the company s total debt at december   including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements 
if market rates of interest on all of the company s floating rate debt permanently increased by basis points a increase  the increase in interest expense on the company s floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on all of the company s floating rate debt permanently decreased by basis points a decrease  the decrease in interest expense on the company s floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results other than interest expense 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to the company at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
