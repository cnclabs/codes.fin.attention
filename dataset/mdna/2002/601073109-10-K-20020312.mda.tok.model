item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with millipore s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
discontinued operations on october   the company announced its plans  subject to certain conditions  to separate into two distinct companies by making its microelectronics business segment an independent  publicly traded company 
in accordance with these plans  the microelectronics business segment was separated into a wholly owned millipore subsidiary named mykrolis corporation mykrolis on march  during the second quarter of  the company received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the mykrolis spin off transaction  as planned  would be tax free to the company and its shareholders 
thereafter  the company s management and board of directors approved the plan of disposition for mykrolis 
accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes reflect the company s microelectronics business as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
on august   mykrolis completed an initial public offering the mykrolis ipo of million of its common shares at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the mykrolis ipo  after deducting the underwriting discount  commissions and other direct costs  were approximately million 
of that amount  mykrolis paid million to the company as a repayment of amounts outstanding under the separation agreements between the two companies 
no additional mykrolis shares were purchased pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option provided for as part of the mykrolis ipo 
prior to the mykrolis ipo  the company s ownership in mykrolis outstanding common shares was  and at december  the company s ownership in mykrolis outstanding common shares was approximately 
on january   the company announced a stock dividend of all of the shares of common stock of mykrolis owned by the company 
the dividend distribution occurred on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon millipore s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires millipore to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets and income taxes 
millipore bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
certain contracts associated with the company s process equipment business are recorded on the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared to the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
revenue from deferred service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
millipore maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company periodically reviews intangible assets to determine if impairment has taken place due to changed business conditions or technological obsolescence and accordingly  the net book value of the asset may be reduced 
millipore records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

the company has settled its liability pursuant to consent decrees releasing millipore from further liability with respect to certain covered matters at all of these superfund sites 
however  as is typical with consent decrees in such superfund proceedings  epa and the relevant state agencies have reserved the right to maintain actions against the settling parties  including the company  in the event certain events occur or do not occur at those sites 
the company does not expect that the conditions in the consent decrees permitting these governmental parties to re open the cases will occur 
in any event  the company believes that the aggregate of any future potential liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in light of the advanced stage of funded remedial action at each site and the likely availability of contribution from numerous other financially solvent prps participating at each such superfund site 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
with respect to all derivative instruments  sfas no 
requires that companies  upon adoption of the new standard  record an adjustment to record the difference between a derivative s previous carrying amount and its current fair market value as a transition adjustment 
at december   the company was a party to us dollar to japanese yen foreign currency fixed rate to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements  which were designated as a hedge of the company s net investment exposure in its japanese subsidiary 
on january   the company recorded a net derivative liability transition adjustment of million which was the difference between the company s carrying value and the fair value of this derivative 
this transition adjustment was recorded as a cumulative effect type adjustment to other comprehensive income 
during the first quarter of  the swap agreements were terminated and a gain of million was realized and recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  the company is no longer required to provide any cash collateralization which had previously been required as part of one of its swap agreements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted by the company as required in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition  the standard eliminates the requirement to accrue for losses through the estimated date of disposal of a business 
the provisions of this standard do not apply to the company s disposal of mykrolis corporation in the second quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales the company has demonstrated relatively stable patterns of sales growth and expect revenues in local currencies to increase to percentage points over the company s customers  particularly those involved in the production of therapeutic compounds  purchase products for use in validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of the manufacturing process for these new drugs in order to be specified into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
growth in this market is highly dependent on the development and approval of new drugs 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals  however  the number of drugs at various stages in the approval process has increased over the past two years 
the remaining driver of this segment is life science research and development spending 
recently published industry reports in the area of life science anticipate increased research and development spending for genomics  proteomics and drug discovery 
the company will benefit if these trends prove out  however the extent to which the company will benefit from this trend is not quantifiable 
approximately percent of the company s sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally made in local currency 
as previously noted  currencies had a net negative impact to both sales and earnings in as compared to this was the composite result of both a weaker yen and a weaker euro in since the end of  the dollar has continued to strengthen against the yen and the euro 
therefore  if rates of exchange remain at the march  level  there could be a significant negative impact on sales for the first quarter and full year as compared to gross margins the company expects slightly higher gross margin percentages in as compared to the continued favorable mix of higher margin consumable products versus lower margin process systems hardware combined with automation and volume efficiencies will combine to more than offset increased costs of certain raw materials and labor  continued new product start up costs  volume driven pricing arrangements and additional costs due to increased manufacturing capacity 
however  to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar remain at march  levels  first quarter and full year margins could be significantly negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as compared to the same periods of the prior year 
millipore s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply 
for certain critical raw materials  millipore has qualified only a single source 
with sufficient lead times  the company believes it would be able to validate alternate suppliers for each of these raw materials 
two of these critical raw materials are used in a significant portion of the company s products 
if the company were unable to obtain supply of either of these raw materials  the loss of revenues to the company would be material 
in december  the company s sole supplier of one of these two critical raw materials  which is used in the manufacture of one type of membrane sold by the company  advised the company that it would discontinue manufacture of that raw material during the second half of in the second quarter of the company established supply arrangements with a successor company to the former supplier of this raw material 
in addition  the company is in the process of identifying alternative sources of supply of this raw material 
the company believes that these arrangements will provide an adequate source of supply for this raw material 
operating expenses the company expects that operating expenses  before the impact of changes in foreign currency rates of exchange  as a percentage of sales  in will be slightly greater than the percentage achieved in the previous year primarily as a result of continued investment in strategic r d projects 
in addition  the company will continue to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving the company s competitive positions 
net interest expense  capital resources and liquidity the company intends to use its excess borrowing capacity under the credit agreement to satisfy the million unsecured note due on april  accordingly  the company expects that its interest expense should decline due to a lower interest rate under the credit agreement 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be approximately  equivalent to the effective rate for  excluding unusual items 
the tax rate estimate is based on the company s current expectations for income  current tax law and tax jurisdiction mix of revenues and profits
