year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
for the year ended december   our total revenue was million  an increase of over million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to a full year s results for compensation resource group full twelve months compared to four months in and pearl meyer full twelve months compared to six months in  and the addition of rich florin solutions inc fdba executive alliance in march in addition  we had strong sales results in the corporate and community banking markets in gross profit 
gross profit for was million  a increase over million for gross profit margin for and was and  respectively 
gross profit margin was negatively impacted by more sales in that were generated by independent consultants who typically are paid higher commissions 
however  this was partially offset by the larger percentage of total sales in generated by our compensation consulting group which had a positive impact on our gross profit margin 
we expect a continued improvement in our gross profit margins in future years from the increasing compensation consulting revenue and expected stronger sales results from our employee consultants 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in the increase can be primarily attributed to the full year results of compensation resource group  pearl meyer and the acquisitions completed in as a percentage of revenue  it has declined from to due to integration activities at the groups and spreading of fixed costs over a larger revenue base 
during  corporate general and adminstrative expense was million 
total expenses for were million 
this increase over prior year can be attributed primarily to more expenses related to the start up of the reinsurance business and larger bonuses in as a result of our performance 
amortization 
amortization was million in or higher than the million in this is a result of a full year s amortization cost for compensation resource group and pearl meyer 
as a result of new accounting rules outlined in fas which are effective january   goodwill will no longer be amortized 
approximately million of the amortization in related to goodwill

we had additional borrowings of million during the year to fund our acquisitions 
our longterm bank debt was paid off with the proceeds from our secondary offering in november income taxes 
income taxes in were million which resulted in an effective tax rate of compared with million or an effective tax rate of in we received a refund for prior year s taxes of approximately million during the year which reduced our rate for the tax year

for the year ended december   our total revenue was million  an increase of over million for the year ended december  this increase in total revenue was attributable primarily to significant increases in first year commission revenue from business owned life insurance and our acquisitions of compensation resource group and pearl meyer in revenue also benefited from the inclusion of the healthcare group for a full twelve months compared with nine months in gross profit 
gross profit for was million  a increase over million for gross profit margin for and was and  respectively  reflecting the reduction of commissions paid on business generated by the wamberg organization  our largest independent consultant which we acquired in september general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million  an increase of million  or  over general and administrative expense increased due to the natural increase in expenses required to support increased revenue and operations  the inclusion of our healthcare group and other acquisitions for a full year and higher corporate general and administrative expense 
during  corporate general and administrative expense was million  including  of reorganization expenses and  of legal expenses relating to acquisitions that were not consummated 
results also include the net loss of  from insurance alliance group operations 
excluding this component  corporate general and administrative expense would have been million for total expenses for  the year our corporate office was established in north barrington  were million 
amortization 
amortization of intangibles increased million or over the entire amount is attributable to companies acquired in and the full year s effect of companies acquired in interest expense net 
net interest expense was million in  a increase from the million net interest expense in this was due to a million increase in our net borrowings in non operating income 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million of life insurance proceeds as a result of the death of one of our employees 
this one time credit increased net income for by approximately per share 
income taxes 
income taxes in were million which resulted in an effective tax rate of compared with million or an effective tax rate of in tax expense in was reduced by the receipt of  of state tax refunds a direct reduction of our state income tax expense and the receipt of million of non taxable life insurance proceeds as a result of the death of one of our employees 
net income 
net income of million in represented a million  or increase over on a diluted per share basis  earnings of were  or  over acquisitions our acquisition program continues to remain broadly focused on adding new markets or expanding those in which we already have a presence 
we feel we furthered this objective in by acquiring rich  florin solutions  inc fdba executive alliance  a technical and middle management compensation consulting firm  during the first quarter  and management science associates  inc  a consultant to the healthcare industry  in the third quarter  along with three other acquisitions in the companies we acquire are typically privately owned and structured as s corporations with the income taxed directly to the shareholders 
our evaluation focus is on the quality of the management and future earnings and growth potential of the target company 
in several of our acquisitions  we also acquire the financial value embedded in a book of recurring renewal business that is expected to be realized for many years after the acquisition takes place 
we typically structure a majority of the purchase price in cash 
we acquire little in the way of tangible assets  thus creating a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
up until now  our future renewal revenue stream has been the source of collateral for our acquisition line of credit 
as we acquire more businesses that do not have this attribute  this may limit our future borrowing availability 
on march   we acquired the business along with certain assets and liabilities of rich  florin solutions  inc fdba executive alliance  a boston  massachusetts compensation consulting company 
this acquisition created a new operating segment for the company rewards and performance previously known as corporate practice 
the net assets acquired were approximately million 
the purchase price was million  before expenses  consisting of a cash payment at closing of million and million of contingent payments over the next four years based on the attainment of established financial performance criteria 
when earned  the contingent payments will consist of cash and in our common stock

acquisition expenses were  and are not included in the purchase price above 
the cash portion of the purchase price was borrowed under our acquisition and working capital credit facility 
the acquisition of crg has been accounted for as a purchase with million of the purchase price allocated to the present value of in force revenue and amortized over a period of thirty years and million allocated to goodwill which will be amortized over twenty years 
the goodwill allocation includes million of net deferred tax liabilities arising from the portion of the purchase price that will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
goodwill amortization ceased on december  under new accounting rules 
crg is an executive compensation and benefits organization that provides the design  marketing and administration of non qualified benefit plans 
crg is headquartered in los angeles  california and has affiliated offices in seven other cities 
prior to the acquisition  we had no material relationship with crg 
coincident with this acquisition  we entered into a bonus arrangement for certain key executives and employees of crg 
this arrangement will provide for the payment of bonuses of up to million if certain stipulated financial objectives are achieved during the years ended december  to the division president has the opportunity to earn up to million in bonuses through based on certain financial objectives as outlined in the employment agreement

on february   we announced the signing of a letter of intent to purchase comiskey kaufman  inc comiskey kaufman is a houston  texas based provider of executive benefits consulting for major companies in the southwest  primarily in texas 
consummation of the purchase is subject to the approval of both companies boards of directors  our lending banks and the satisfactory completion of financial and business due diligence

the purchase price was million before expenses consisting of a cash payment at closing of million and million of contingent payments consisting of cash and stock over the next years based upon attainments of established performance criteria 
clark bardes reinsurance company  ltd 
cbrcl  a wholly owned subsidiary of clark bardes  inc  was incorporated in the cayman islands with limited liability effective december  cbrcl was formed in order to increase and diversify our earnings stream by participating in the underwriting profits of the insurance business produced by its various operating segments 
the governor in council granted approval on december  for the issue of an unrestricted class b insurer s license to cbrcl  subject to the receipt and approval by the cayman monetary authority of certain outstanding requirements of the law 
as of december   cbrcl had not yet been capitalized nor had it begun its reinsurance operations 
the insurance license for cbrcl has been issued and is effective as of february  secondary offering on november and   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the entire amount of the proceeds received of million was used to repay bank debt 
tax enforcement policy last year  we had reported that the tax court had found in favor of the internal revenue service in their efforts to disallow an interest deduction by a company having purchased an executive benefit program funded by a life insurance product known as leveraged coli 
since then  the irs has continued to litigate the matter with other companies and has prevailed on three more cases 
we have not offered leveraged coli in our product offerings since consequently  we do not expect any adverse effects on our future new business revenue stream 
however  because of the varied facts and circumstances surrounding each case  it is impossible to determine the effects of any case on a client s decision to continue or surrender any existing policy 
because of the number of other variables  including adverse tax implications resulting from a surrender of the insurance contracts  it is impossible to predict the ultimate effect  if any  this could have on our future renewal revenues 
in january  the treasury department and the internal revenue service served notice on taxpayers of their intent to consider taxing the equity increase in what are known as equity split dollar arrangements  to the individual beneficiary of the coverage 
heretofore  the individual did not sustain a tax liability until the policy was closed and the equity distributed 
the implementation of this notice may have a negative impact on our ability to market new equity split dollar arrangements and could potentially affect existing split dollar arrangements 
revenue sources and recognition our operating units derive their revenue primarily from commissions paid by the insurance companies that underwrite the policies underlying the various benefit programs  program design and administrative service fees paid by clients  and executive compensation and benefit consulting fees 
our commission revenue is usually long term and recurring  is typically paid annually and extend for a period of ten years or more after the sale 
commissions paid by insurance companies vary by policy and by program and usually represent a percentage of the premium or the cash surrender value of the insurance policies underlying our program 
first year revenue 
first year revenue is derived from two principal sources  a the commission we earn when the client first purchases the policies underlying the program 
it is the financial result of our sales efforts 
first year revenue is recognized in the amount due or paid by the carrier at the time the application is substantially completed  the client is contractually committed to purchase the insurance policies and the initial premium payments are paid by the client to the insurance company  and b fees for the services we perform in advising our clients on their executive compensation programs 
these fees are based on a rate per hour arrangement and are earned when the service is rendered and billed to the client 
renewal commission revenue 
renewal revenue is the commission we receive based on the premiums on the policies underlying the benefit programs we have sold in prior periods 
renewal revenue is recognized on the date that the renewal premium is due or paid to the insurance company depending on the type of policy 
renewal revenue in future periods  which is not recorded on our balance sheet  is estimated to be approximately million over the next five years 
however  renewal revenue can be affected by policy surrenders or exchanges  material contract changes  asset growth and case mortality rates 
over the last five years  we have experienced a persistency rate of approximately of the inforce insurance underlying our programs 
however  we can give no assurances that our persistency rate will remain at this level 
we intend to do all we can to retain our clients  service their accounts and sustain our persistency 
other revenue 
other revenue consists of several sources of revenue associated with our operations  including various consulting fees we may charge incident to the studies we perform in the development of a specific benefit program and fees we charge our clients for the administration of their benefit program 
both of these fees are recorded as revenue as they are earned in accordance with the governing agreement 
other significant accounting policies intangible assets we have intangible assets representing the excess of the costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the tangible net assets associated with the acquisition 
intangible assets consist of the net present value of future cash flows from existing business at the acquisition date  non compete agreements with the former owners and goodwill 
the amortization periods for the non compete agreements are years and years 
the net present value of inforce revenue is amortized over to years the expected average policy duration 
there are certain assumptions related to persistency  expenses  and discount rates that are used in the calculation of inforce revenue 
if any of these assumptions change  it could effect the carrying value of the inforce revenue 
under accounting rules  we periodically review and test the recoverability of these assets 
related party transactions in connection with the acquisition of the wamberg organization in september  the asset purchase agreement provided for additional payments to wt wamberg  our chief executive officer and previous owner of the wamberg organization  upon attainment of certain stipulated annual financial objectives starting with the period ended december  through december  as of december   the financial objectives for those years have been met and a total cash payment of million was made to w 
t 
wamberg and recorded as additional purchase price 
the board of directors has approved the distribution of the wamberg organization earnout payment prior to the date we are obligated to distribute the proceeds 
the earnout target has been achieved and the payment will be made but discounted for the time value of money 
million was accrued for this payment in the consolidated financial statements at december  we lease  square feet of office space controlled by mr 
wamberg for an annual rental of approximately  under a lease expiring on february  we funded our deferred compensation plan at year end with an insurance policy under which we recognized revenue of  as stated in our revenue recognition policy 
the employment agreement with one of our division presidents was revised in december to change bonuses for key performance measures 
no cash payments were made in december  however  was accrued as the amount that has been earned to date under the new agreement 
during  we paid william seidman  a member of our board of directors   for services in connection with the evaluation of a potential acquisition target 
our chairman and chief executive officer  tom wamberg and richard chapman  executive vice president of clark bardes  inc and president of the banking practice  have collectively invested million in a company which george dalton  a member of our board of directors is founder and majority shareholder 
william archer  a member of our board of directors since february  is a senior policy advisor at pricewaterhouse coopers llp 
we previously engaged pricewaterhouse coopers llp to perform various consulting related to the installation of our wide area network and a knowledge management system at one of our compensation consulting practices 
during  we paid approximately  to pricewaterhouse coopers llp for these services 
fox pitt kelton  co manager of our november secondary offering owns conning capital partners 
steve piaker  a member of our board of directors  is a partner with conning capital partners 
quarterly results our operating results can fluctuate considerably  especially when compared on a consecutive quarterly basis 
we can experience large increases in revenue in the first and fourth quarter and operating results may be affected by a number of other factors  including new or enhanced programs and services by us or our competitors and client acceptance or rejection of these programs  program development expenses  competitive  legislative and regulatory changes and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
sales cycles often take between twelve to eighteen months  with a significant amount of revenue that can come from a few large cases 
our revenue is thus difficult to forecast  and we believe that comparing our consecutive quarterly results of operations is not necessarily meaningful  nor does it indicate what results we will achieve for any subsequent period 
the following table presents a summary of key revenue and expense statistics for the most recent eight calendar quarters

compensation resource group operating results year ended december revenue first year   renewal   total   commission expense   gross profit   of revenue general and administrative   of revenue amortization of   intangibles total   operating income   of revenue formerly our clark bardes segment  the segment now consists of the original core business as well as the schoenke  wiedemann johnson  wamberg organization  and compensation resource group acquisitions 
the segment was reorganized with the acquisition of compensation resource group and renamed clark bardes consulting compensation resource group 
in order to streamline the focus of the segment  the bank owned life insurance business of this segment was transferred to the banking practice  effective january  and the clark bardes consulting compensation resource group segment will concentrate on non qualified executive benefit plans 
revenue was million for compared to million for this increase of million is primarily attributed to a full year of results in for compensation resource group full twelve months in versus months in and strong first quarter sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined from in to in due to more sales being generated by senior consultants who are generally paid a higher commission expense 
general and administrative expenses increased over this is primarily attributed to a full year of expenses in for compensation resource group full twelve months in versus months in operating income as percentage of revenue declined from in to in as a result of the higher commission expense mentioned above and a full year of amortization expense

in  we acquired rich florin solutions  inc fdba executive alliance which helped us expand our compensation consulting services 
the performance of compensation consulting was negatively impacted by the events of september  during the later half of third quarter and the beginning of fourth quarter 
results attributable to acquisitions as an acquirer  our operating results are significantly influenced by the contributions of our acquired businesses 
for reporting purposes  we consider the operating results from any business not appearing in four complete quarters as being from acquisitions 
after that  they become part of existing business 
non material acquisitions are not included in the acquisition column 
an analysis of our operating results  separating acquisitions from existing business is as follows year ended year ended december  december  existing acquisitions combined existing acquisitions combined revenue first year    renewal   total    commission expense   gross profit    general and administrative expense    operating income before amortization    amortization of   intangibles iag writeoff   operating income    in  approximately of gross revenue and of operating income were from acquisitions while of gross revenue and of operating income were from acquisitions in we do not attribute a great deal of significance to these statistics because an acquisition s contribution to operating performance in any given period is considerably dependent on the timing of the transaction and whether it is considered an acquisition for definition purposes 
in addition  the statistics only break out acquisitions that are considered material to our financial results 
finally  the resources of our existing businesses that are dedicated to our acquisition program could have had an impact on the performance of the existing business had the acquisitions not been made 
liquidity and capital resources selected measures of liquidity and capital resources 
as of december  cash and cash equivalents  working capital  current ratio to one shareholders equity per common share debt to total capitalization total stockholders equity divided by actual shares outstanding at year end excluding shares on option current debt plus long term debt divided by current debt plus long term deb t plus stockholders equity our working capital ratio at december  was to compared to the ratio of 
to at december  as an acquiring company  a significant amount of borrowing is done to finance our acquisitions 
because of this and the strong cash generated by operations  management has determined to dedicate all excess cash to help with the funding of future acquisitions  as a result  only cash for reasonably foreseeable needs and expenses is retained 
the debt to total capitalization ratio significantly decreased from due to the pay off of the debt with the proceeds from our secondary offering 
it should be noted that our loan agreements do not impose a working capital covenant or restriction because of the value of our renewal revenue that is used as collateral for our senior debt 
due to the nature of the commission structure on the insurance policies underlying our clients benefit programs  we have an on going renewal revenue stream  estimated to be million over the next ten years 
our balance sheet currently reflects million of renewals  in the form of intangible assets attributed to the net present value of renewals from acquired companies purchased through acquisitions 
other than these intangibles  renewals are not reflected on our balance sheet 
as a financial company with strong operating cash flow  we have little need to retain substantial cash balances 
we use the net cash from operating activities to pay down existing debt  fund capital expenditures and finance small acquisitions 
we expect that large future acquisitions will be financed primarily through externally available funds 
however  we can offer no assurance that such funds will be available and  if so  on terms acceptable to us 
year ended d ecember  cash flows from used in operations  investing  financing  cash flows from operating activities our cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended december   improved significantly over that of the comparable twelve month period in the components were year ended d ecember  net income plus non cash expenses  changes in operating assets and liabilities  cash flow from operating activities  the following table represents the estimated gross renewal revenue associated with our inforce business owned life insurance policies as of december  the projected gross revenue is not adjusted for mortality  lapse or other factors that may impair realization 
we cannot assure you that commissions under these policies will be received 
these projected gross revenues are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management and are not necessarily indicative of the revenue that may actually be achieved in the future 
compensation bankin g healthcare resource group practic e group total total december    total december    the bank owned life insurance product sold by the former clark bardes segment which was included in crg was transferred to the banking practice thus placing all of our bank owned life insurance business in one segment  commencing january  year inforce revenues net of commission expense are million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities acquisitions accounted for million used in investing activities and million was used for the purchase of equipment 
cash spending for acquisitions included partners first rich florin solutions management sceience associates lyons compensation and benefits coates kenney the wamberg organization earnout because of the income tax structure of the companies we seek to acquire  a substantial amount of the purchase price is paid in cash 
this is also due  in part  to our desire to avoid diluting our existing shareholders 
we expect acquisitions to continue and be financed primarily from available credit lines and possible additional equity 
however  we can offer no assurances such will be the case 
cash flows from financing activities in december  we amended our amended and restated credit agreement dated december  to increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
there is no longer a term loan balance of this facility 
we paid off the term portion under the old agreement in december with the proceeds from our november secondary offering 
any outstanding debt on december  will convert from the revolving credit facility to term debt and will amortize over years under the term facility agreement 
the restrictive covenants under the loan agreement provide for the maintenance of a minimum ratio of fixed charges  a maximum allowable leverage ratio  a minimum amount of stockholders equity  and  a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  in november  we sold  shares in a secondary offering 
the entire proceeds from the sale of approximately million were used to repay all debt under our credit facility 
we will have more flexibility with where our money can be directed because of the pay off of the debt 
we had million available under our credit lines at december  we believe that our cash flow from operations will continue to provide sufficient funds to service our debt obligations 
however  as our business grows  our working capital and capital expenditures requirements will also continue to increase 
there can be no assurance  that the net cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated requirements or that we will not require additional debt or equity financing within this time frame 
we may continue to issue stock to finance future acquisitions 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations 
the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by expected maturity dates totaling million 
expected matu rity date thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate     average interest rate inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain of our expenses  such as compensation  benefits and capital equipment costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
however  the majority of our service and administrative agreements with clients  which generate fee income  have a cost of living adjustment tied to the consumer price index 
management believes that future inflationary pressures will continue to be offset  because as inflation increases  investment returns will also increase  resulting in higher cash values and higher commission rates 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb accounting standard derivatives and hedging activities as of january   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement which was issued in june together with its amendments statements  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities issued in june and june  respectively are collectively referred to as statement 
because of our minimal use of derivatives  the adoption of the new statement did not have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
the statement requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
as a result of the pay off of the debt in november with the proceeds from the secondary offering  we were unable to continue our hedging program 
we recorded million as interest expense for the year ended december  related to these interest rate swaps 
prior to january   we also used interest rate swap contracts for hedging purposes 
the net amount paid or received and net amounts accrued through the end of the accounting period were included in interest expense 
fasb accounting standard business combination and goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually
