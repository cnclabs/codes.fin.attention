in the most recent fiscal year ended january  serena has experienced a decrease in total revenue as total revenues were million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal the overall demand for the company s software depends in large part on general and economic business conditions 
the recent general weakening of the worldwide economy and resulting slowdown in it spending contributed to the overall decrease in total revenues 
prior to fiscal  serena had grown rapidly as total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in total revenue has been primarily attributable to increased demand for our mainframe products  and to a lesser extent beginning in the second half of fiscal  the introduction of our distributed systems products  primarily changeman ds  into the marketplace 
in general  demand had been increasing as a result of greater awareness of and need for automated third party scm solutions 
we derive our revenue from software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
in fiscal  of our software license revenue was derived from our mainframe products and from our distributed systems products 
customers typically purchase the mainframe products under million instructions per second  or mips based  perpetual licenses 
mainframe software products and applications are usually priced based on hardware computing capacity 
mips is a capacity measurement used by hardware manufacturers to rate computer size to determine the amount of capacity for running applications and supporting users 
the higher a hardware s mips capacity  the more expensive a software license will be 
customers increasing their mips capacity are required to purchase an additional software license when upgrading the hardware 
our distributed systems products are licensed on a per user seat basis 
software products are also typically priced based on a perpetual license agreement  which entitles a customer to use the product on an ongoing basis 
initial mainframe license transactions generally include one year of software maintenance and support 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our mainframe or distributed systems products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our mainframe products for our revenue and our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes 
we also provide ongoing maintenance  which includes technical support  version upgrades and enhancements  for an annual fee of approximately to of the current list price of the licensed product 
we recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance contract on a straight line basis 
professional services revenue is derived from consulting and educational services  including implementation and integration of licensed software  specialized consulting services such as best practices design  development and deployment of scm solutions  and education courses for serena s products 
our professional services are typically billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized as the related services are performed 
historically  serena s revenue has primarily been attributable to sales in north america 
in fiscal  and  revenue attributable to sales in north america accounted for approximately  and of serena s total revenue  respectively 
our international revenue is attributable principally to our european operations 
international sales represented approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenue growth in fiscal  when compared to  and in fiscal  when compared to  was and  respectively 
the revenue growth rate decrease in fiscal is a result of very weak economic conditions in europe 
we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future when overseas economic conditions improve 
any expansion of our international operations will be subject to a variety of risks that could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business 
in north america  serena s revenue is generally denominated in united states dollars while international sales are generally denominated in local currencies  principally the british pound and euro 
should serena s international sales and operations expand  we anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
see factors that may affect future results fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena 
maintenance revenue and professional services revenue have lower gross profit margins than software license revenue as a result of costs inherent in operating our customer support and professional services organizations 
acquisitions in fiscal  namely hps and startool  have resulted in the elimination of sublicense fee obligations with respect to our changeman ssm and startool fdm products  respectively 
prior to these acquisitions  sublicense fees were incurred on the revenue we recognized in connection with license and maintenance transactions involving these products 
as a result  prior to these acquisitions  our license and maintenance revenues for our changeman ssm and startool fdm products had lower gross profit margins than license and maintenance revenue from other products 
beginning in the second and third quarters of fiscal  and continuing through all of fiscal  for changeman ssm and startool fdm  respectively  this is no longer the case 
we expect operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to develop new and enhanced versions of our products  including our distributed systems product suite  increase our sales and marketing activities  expand our distribution channels  increase our professional services capabilities and pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
any failure by serena to significantly increase revenue as we implement these initiatives could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of disposal of long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
serena recognizes revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and generally recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
serena defines each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is serena s customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and serena  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with serena 
delivery has occurred 
serena s software is physically delivered to the customer 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
serena s policy is to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees paid 
serena may agree to extended payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs 
generally  at least of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
serena typically sells to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  revenues are recognized as cash is collected 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  license and maintenance  revenue is allocated to each component of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of its fair value  which is the price charged when the elements are sold separately 
since vsoe has not been established for license transactions  the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the license portion of multiple element transactions 
the company sells its products to its end users and distributors under license agreements 
each new mainframe license includes maintenance  which includes the right to receive telephone support  bug fixes and unspecified upgrades and enhancements  for a specified duration of time  usually one year 
the fee associated with such agreements is allocated between software license revenue and maintenance revenue based on their respective fair values as determined based on list price 
software license revenue from these agreements is recognized upon receipt and acceptance of a signed contract and delivery of the software  provided the related fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the revenue is probable and the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period  as defined in the applicable software license agreement 
the company recognizes maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the related maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts on perpetual licenses generally renew annually 
the company typically invoices and collects maintenance fees on an annual basis at the anniversary date of the license 
service and other revenue includes fees derived from the delivery of training  installation  and consulting services 
revenue from training  installation  and consulting services is recognized on a time and materials basis as the related services are performed 
these services do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
deferred revenue represents amounts received by the company in advance of performance of the maintenance obligation 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where we expect that payment will likely not be received  and we have established a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
in determining specific receivables where collection may not be received  we review past due receivables and give consideration to prior collection history  changes in the customer s overall business condition  the potential risk associated with the customer s industry or political and economic environment among other factors 
we establish a general reserve for all receivable amounts that have not been specifically identified  by applying a graduated percentage to each invoice s relative aging category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate as of the reporting dates 
changes may occur in the future  which may make us reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
if an asset is to be disposed of  it is reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
to date  there has been no significant impairment of long lived assets 
see effect of recent accounting pronouncements  elsewhere in this report 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
historical results of operations the following table sets forth the historical results of operations for serena expressed as a percentage of total revenue and are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
historical results include the post acquisition results of diamond from june   hps from may   startool from august  and ultimis from september  percentage of revenue fiscal year ended january  revenue software licenses maintenance professional services total revenue cost of revenue software licenses maintenance professional services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income comparison of fiscal years ended january   and revenue serena s total revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a increase from fiscal to and a decrease from fiscal to software licenses 
software licenses revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
software licenses revenue increased million or from fiscal to and decreased million or from fiscal to the dollar increase in fiscal  when compared to the same period the year before  is generally attributed to increased demand for new licenses of our products as a result of greater customer awareness of and need for third party scm solutions  fueled by new it initiatives associated with the internet  ecommerce and the webification of legacy systems  and the introduction of our distributed systems products  primarily changeman ds  in the second half of fiscal the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally attributable to a slowdown in it spending across all products as a result of the weak economic conditions in both the us and europe and  to a lesser extent delays experienced in executing certain sales transactions 
in particular  sales of our changeman zmf  changeman ds and comparex products continue to make up a significant portion of our total software licenses revenue 
combined  they accounted for million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total software licenses revenue  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  and more significantly in fiscal  sales of our distributed systems products  predominantly changeman ds  make up an increasing proportion of total software licenses revenue 
distributed systems products accounted for million or of total software licenses revenue in fiscal as compared to million or and million or in fiscal and  respectively 
the company expects that its distributed systems revenues will increase  and that changeman zmf  changeman ds and comparex will continue to account for a substantial portion of software licenses revenue in the future 
we may experience slower or little growth in license revenue in the near term 
maintenance 
maintenance revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases reflect growth in installed software licenses base  as new licenses generally include one year of maintenance  renewals of maintenance agreements by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  maintenance price increases  all partially offset by some cancellations in comparex maintenance contracts  particularly in fiscal when the general weakening of the economy in the us and abroad caused some customers to reevaluate and restrict it spending 
maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal  when compared to the prior two fiscal years where it had remained relatively constant  as a result of reduced license revenues resulting from a decline in the rate of growth from the general weakening of the economy and slowdown in it spending which began predominantly in the second quarter of fiscal professional services 
professional services revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
professional services revenue increased million or from fiscal to and decreased million or from fiscal to in general  the dollar increase in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to greater consulting opportunities resulting from our larger installed customer base and our expanded consulting service capabilities 
the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is predominantly the result of a weak us economy which generated declining license revenues and therefore fewer consulting opportunities and the deferral of existing consulting projects all beginning more specifically in the second quarter of fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenue  which consists of cost of software licenses  cost of maintenance and cost of professional services  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue decreased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to as a percentage of total revenue  cost of revenue has been decreasing year over year as the rate of growth in revenue has been greater than the rate of growth in costs associated with our customer support and professional services infrastructures  including personnel additions to support maintenance and professional services revenue growth  and decreases in software sublicense fees 
in general  the year over year improvements in the cost of revenue margins are the result of margin improvements in software licenses and maintenance offset by margin declines in professional services 
the margin improvement from in fiscal to in fiscal  was predominantly the result of the elimination of sublicense fees associated with our changeman ssm and startool fdm products in fiscal the margin improvement in fiscal from fiscal was predominantly the result of the elimination of sublicense fees in fiscal and other cost containment measures put in place in fiscal software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists principally of fees associated with our startool fdm product and more recently beginning in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  fees associated with integrating third party technology into our changeman ds  changeman alm and changeman ecp distributed systems products 
through the first quarter of fiscal and the middle of the third quarter of fiscal  cost of software licenses also included sublicense fees associated with our changeman ssm and startool fdm products  respectively 
cost of software licenses was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total software licenses revenue  respectively 
cost of software licenses decreased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the decreases in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total software licenses revenue  are attributable to decreases in royalty bearing software licenses  predominantly startool fdm  as a percentage of total software licenses revenue and the elimination of royalty fees associated with our changeman ssm and startool fdm products 
royalty bearing software licenses represented  and of total software license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with our customer support organizations  and to a lesser extent  sublicense fees associated with our startool fdm product through the middle of the third quarter of fiscal and our changeman ssm product through the first quarter of fiscal cost of maintenance was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total maintenance revenue  respectively 
cost of maintenance decreased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar decreases were predominantly due to decreases in sublicense fees associated with our startool fdm and changeman ssm products  partially offset by increases in expenses associated with our customer support organization 
cost of maintenance as a percentage of total maintenance revenue has decreased year over year as the rate of increase in maintenance revenue has been greater than the rate of increase in costs associated with our customer support organization and as a result of the decrease in license revenue in fiscal professional services 
cost of professional services consists of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with supporting our professional services organization 
cost of professional services was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total professional services revenue  respectively 
cost of professional services increased million or from fiscal to and decreased million or from fiscal to in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar increase is predominately due to increased expenses associated with our professional services organization including personnel additions and other infrastructure costs needed to support the professional services revenue growth  offset in part by reductions in early fiscal of independent contractors and reallocations of professional services resources to other parts of the organization as the result of our customers putting projects on hold to address issues associated with becoming year compliant 
in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar decrease is predominantly due to cost savings initiatives put in place in the third quarter of fiscal as a percentage of total professional services revenues  the increases year over year are predominantly due to the rates of increases in expenses associated with our professional services organization  including other infrastructure costs needed to support the professional services revenue  being greater than rates of increases in professional services revenue 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  payroll taxes and employee benefits as well as travel  entertainment and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are due primarily to the continued expansion of our direct sales and marketing organizations to support license revenue growth  and to a lesser extent  our marketing initiatives surrounding our distributed systems products and the development of our international sales and telesales efforts  all partially offset by cost savings initiatives put in place in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal  when compared to the prior fiscal year  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased as the rate of increase in total revenue was greater than the rate of increase in sales and marketing expenses 
in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased as the rate of increase in sales and marketing expenses  even with the cost containment measures put in place in the third quarter of fiscal  was greater than the rate of increase in total revenues 
in absolute dollar terms  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel  market our distributed systems products and undertake additional marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and employee benefits and costs attributable to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the increases were primarily due to increased costs generally associated with the expansion of our research and development efforts and the company s acquisition of ultimis and the startool asset purchase in late fiscal we expect research and development expenses to increase  both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue  as we continue to hire additional research and development personnel primarily to develop our distributed systems product suite 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits and certain non allocable administrative costs  including legal and accounting fees and bad debts 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from fiscal to and decreased million or from fiscal to in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar increase is primarily due to compensation costs associated with the expansion of our administrative infrastructure in order to support our increased sales  marketing  professional services and maintenance activities  and to a lesser extent  costs associated with being a public company  all partially offset by a decrease in legal fees as a result of the company s lawsuit settlement 
in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar decrease is predominantly the result of efficiency gains and cost and growth controls put in place within our administrative infrastructure  including more recently cost containment measures put in place in the third quarter of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in legal fees as a result of the company s lawsuit settlement in the third quarter of fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms as we expand our infrastructure and our operations 
stock based compensation 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  serena recorded aggregate deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with the issuance of restricted stock and grant of options to purchase common stock in january an additional million of deferred stock based compensation was recorded in fiscal for stock based awards granted during this period 
no deferred stock based compensation was recorded in fiscal  or in fiscal  the repurchase in may of restricted common stock originally issued in january and the return to the plan of unexercised common stock options resulted in the removal of unamortized deferred stock based compensation of  and  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation is generally being amortized over the to month vesting periods of the related awards 
this amortization is being recorded in a manner consistent with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
of the total deferred stock based compensation    and  was amortized in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to amortize an additional  in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of optima in september  diamond in june  hps in may and ultimis in september  and the startool asset purchase in august  the company has recorded million in intangible assets  off set by amortization totaling million as of january  combined  intangible assets are being amortized over periods of one year or less on million  two to seven years on million and fifteen years on the remaining million

in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which the company has adopted effective february  upon adoption  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
accordingly  with the commencement of fiscal  the company will no longer amortize goodwill but instead will review goodwill for impairment annually 
excluding goodwill and other intangible assets that will no longer be amortized  we expect to amortize approximately million per quarter over the next eight quarters through fiscal intangible assets will be fully amortized by the end of fiscal see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena and effect of recent accounting pronouncements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations elsewhere in this report 
restructuring charges 
early in the third quarter of fiscal  in response to the general weakening of the worldwide economy and resulting it spending slowdown  the company announced and began to execute its plan to reduce workforce by approximately or positions affecting all parts of the organization and incur costs associated with the closure of facilities 
the company has realized and expects to continue to realize cost savings going forward as a result of this reduction and other cost savings initiatives implemented 
in connection with these actions  the company recorded a restructuring charge in fiscal consisting principally of severance  payroll taxes and other employee benefits totaling million and facilities closures totaling million 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or in fiscal over and a decrease of million or in fiscal over the dollar increase in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally due to increases in balances on interest bearing accounts  such as cash and cash equivalents  and both short and long term investments  resulting from accumulation of earnings 
the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally due to reduced market interest rates  partially offset by increases in balances on interest bearing accounts  such as cash and cash equivalents  and both short and long term investments  resulting from the accumulation of earnings 
income taxes income taxes 
income taxes were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing effective income tax rates of  and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate has decreased year over year 
the effective income tax rate decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is predominantly due to increased pre tax income growth and increased tax credits  all partially offset by increases in non deductible charges 
the effective income tax rate decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is predominantly the result of decreases in non deductible charges  and to a lesser extent  increases in tax credits  all partially offset by a decrease in pre tax income 
serena s effective income tax rate has historically benefited from the united states research and experimentation tax credit and tax benefits generated from export sales made from the united states 
liquidity and capital resources since serena s inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations 
as of january   serena had million in cash and cash equivalents  and an additional million and million in short and long term investments  respectively  consisting principally of high grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and short and long term corporate notes and bonds 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal and  serena s cash flows provided by operating activities exceeded net income during each of these periods principally due to cash collections in advance of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts  the inclusion of non cash expenses in net income and growth in accrued expenses and corporate taxes payable  all partially offset by growth in accounts receivable and net deferred tax assets during the periods 
in fiscal  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities exceeded net income principally due to the inclusion of non cash expenses in net income  a decrease in trade accounts receivable  cash collections in advance of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts  and a decrease in net deferred tax assets  all partially offset by decreases in corporate taxes payable and accrued expenses 
non cash expenses included in net income consisted of amortization of deferred stock based compensation and intangible assets for all periods  and one time charges in fiscal and for acquired in process research and development totaling million and million  respectively  in connection with the company s acquisitions of diamond in june  hps in may and ultimis in september in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was predominantly related to the net purchase of short and long term investments totaling million  and cash paid in connection with the diamond acquisition in june  net of cash received totaling million

in fiscal  cash used in investing activities predominantly related to net purchases of short and long term investments totaling million 
in fiscal  and  cash used in investing activities were also related to the purchase of computer equipment and office furniture and equipment totaling million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal predominantly related to the company s initial public offering in february which generated cash totaling million  net of ipo costs 
in fiscal and  and to a lesser extent in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was also related to the exercise of stock options under the company s employee stock option plan totaling million  million and million  the repayment of principal on notes receivable from stockholders totaling million  million and million  and the sale of the company s common stock under the employee stock purchase plan totaling million  million and million  respectively 
at january   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures and has no revolving credit agreement or other term loan agreements with any bank or other financial institution 
at january   the company had working capital of million and accounts receivable  net of allowances  of million 
total deferred revenue increased to million at january  from million at january  primarily as a result of increased billings of maintenance fees 
we believe that the net proceeds from the offering and cash from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months

requires that goodwill resulting from a business combination no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
the company is required to adopt  and has adopted  sfas no 
as of february  for goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to july   amortization of such goodwill continued through january   and ceased february  for business combinations occurring on or after july   the associated goodwill will not be amortized 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to perform a transitional impairment test for all recorded goodwill within six months and  if necessary  determine the amount of an impairment loss by january  the effects of adopting sfas no 
are currently being determined 
the company believes that some portion of the goodwill and intangible assets currently being amortized will not be amortized in the future 
amortization expense totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that amortization expense based on current levels of intangible assets that will continue to be amortized in the future will be approximately million per fiscal quarter through fiscal in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
sfas no 
also requires an enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the amount of the asset retirement obligation is revised at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
as of february  the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  and certain accounting and reporting provisions of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which for the company will be fiscal the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are that it removes goodwill from its scope  and therefore  eliminates the requirements of sfas no 
to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment  and describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which an alternative course of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset is under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and does not expect the adoption of such statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operation 
factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements under the private securities reform act of and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other prospective information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including but are not limited to  our reliance on our mainframe products for revenue  the percentage of license revenue typically closed at the end of each quarter making estimation of operating results prior to the end of the quarter extremely uncertain  weak economic conditions worldwide which may continue to affect the overall demand for software and services  which could result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates  changes in revenue mix and seasonality  our ability to deliver our products on the distributed systems platform  dependence on revenues from our installed base  continued demand for additional mainframe mips capacity  expansion of our professional services and international organizations  our ability to manage our growth  and the following there are many factors  including some beyond our control  that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results have varied greatly in the past and may vary greatly in the future depending upon a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this factors that may affect future results section of this report  including many that are beyond our control 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
our software license revenue in any quarter depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  our revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and could impair our business in future periods 
because we do not know when  or if  our potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict our revenue and operating results for future quarters 
in addition  as a result of the economic slowdown worldwide  a number of customers have delayed discretionary spending for software and hardware which has reduced our revenue 
additionally  sales cycles in fiscal lengthened as customers delayed decisions to purchase our products and increase capacity on mainframe computers 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been attributable to the licenses of our mainframe software products 
changes in the mix of software products and services sold by us  including the mix between higher margin software products and lower margin maintenance and services  could materially affect our operating results for future quarters 
economic conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to forecast revenue the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for application software and services 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate and government customers  our business also depends on general economic and business conditions 
the general weakening of the worldwide economy has caused the company to experience a decrease in revenues and revenue growth rates of its software licenses 
a softening of demand for computer software caused by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a continued decrease in revenues and revenue growth rates 
management personnel identify  track and forecast future revenues  backlog and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  such as the estimated date when they estimate that a transaction will close and the potential dollar amount of such sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline at various times to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis provides visibility to our potential customers and the associated revenues for budgeting and planning purposes  these pipeline estimates may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or ever 
a slowdown in the economy  domestically or internationally  has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget improperly and thereby could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
in addition  primarily due to a substantial portion of our software licenses revenue contracts closing in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust the company s cost structure in response to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  and thereby adversely affect our business or results of operations 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customers renewing maintenance agreements for our products and licensing or upgrading additional serena scm products  our future professional service and maintenance revenue is dependent on future sales of our software products we depend on our installed customer base for future revenues from maintenance renewal fees and licenses or upgrades of additional scm products 
if our customers do not purchase additional products  upgrade existing products or cancel or fail to renew their maintenance agreements  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
the terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of software maintenance and support fees 
the maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  our current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  our customers may not necessarily purchase additional products  upgrades or professional services 
our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue are also dependent upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in our software license revenue would have a negative impact on the growth of our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue in future quarters 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our mainframe products for our revenue historically  the majority of our software license revenue has resulted from the sale of our mainframe products 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our mainframe products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
in particular  changeman zmf and comparex  two of our mainframe products  have been responsible for a substantial majority of our revenue 
in each of the last three fiscal years ending january   and  sales of changeman zmf and comparex together accounted for approximately  and of our software licenses revenue  respectively 
we expect that these products will continue to account for a large portion of our software licenses revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future operating results depend on the continued market acceptance of our mainframe products  including future enhancements 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition although serena has been profitable in recent years  we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our united states and international direct sales forces and extending our telesales efforts develop our technology  including our distributed systems products broaden our professional services offerings and delivery capabilities expand our distribution channels pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions with these additional expenses  in order to maintain our current levels of profitability  we will be required to increase our revenue correspondingly 
any failure to increase our revenue as we implement our product  service and distribution strategies would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
our revenue has fluctuated in recent years and we may not experience any revenue growth in the future and our revenue could in fact decline 
our efforts to expand our software product suites  sales and marketing activities  direct and indirect distribution channels and professional service offerings and to pursue strategic relationships or acquisitions may not succeed or may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate 
as a result  we cannot predict our future operating results with any degree of certainty 
our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes we are substantially dependent upon the continued use and acceptance of ibm and ibm compatible mainframes and the growth of this market 
if the role of the mainframe does not increase as we anticipate  or if it in any way decreases  this would materially adversely affect our business  future quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
additionally  if there is a wide acceptance of other platforms or if new platforms emerge that provide enhanced enterprise server capabilities  our business and future operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the majority of our software license revenue to date has been attributable to sales of our mainframe products 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  the majority of our software license revenue will continue to come from sales of our mainframe products 
as a result  future sales of our existing products and associated maintenance revenue and professional service revenue will depend on continued use of mainframes 
our introduction of serena scm products for distributed systems may not be successful we introduced our changeman ds product in fiscal  our changeman alm and changeman ecp products in fiscal and our changeman wcm product in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently developing new products and enhancing our product suite to support additional distributed systems platforms 
if we do not successfully develop  market  sell and support our distributed systems products  this would materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
historically  the majority of our products have been designed for the mainframe platform  and the majority of our software license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional services revenue to date have been attributable to licenses for these mainframe products 
we have limited experience developing  marketing  selling or supporting distributed systems products 
developing  marketing and selling our distributed systems products will require significant resources that we may not have 
our sales and marketing organizations have historically focused exclusively on sales of our products for the mainframe and have limited experience marketing and selling distributed systems products 
additionally  we have limited experience in providing support services for distributed systems products 
competition for experienced software engineers  sales personnel and support staff is intense and if we fail to attract qualified personnel this would impair our ability to support our distributed systems products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater experience providing distributed systems compatible software products than we do  and many also have significantly greater financial and organizational resources 
if the scm market does not evolve as we anticipate  our business will be adversely affected if we fail to properly assess and address the scm market or if our products and services fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business and quarterly and annual operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the scm market is in an early stage of development 
it organizations have traditionally addressed scm needs internally and have only recently become aware of the benefits of third party scm solutions as their scm requirements have become more complex 
since the market for our products is still evolving  it is difficult to assess the competitive environment or the size of the market that may develop 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the number of businesses adopting third party scm products and the expansion of their use on a company wide basis 
the scm market for third party products may grow more slowly than we anticipate 
in addition  technologies  customer requirements and industry standards may change rapidly 
if we cannot improve or augment our products as rapidly as existing technologies  customer requirements and industry standards evolve  our products or services could become obsolete 
the introduction of new or technologically superior products by competitors could also make our products less competitive or obsolete 
as a result of any of these factors  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our sales cycle typically takes six to months to complete and varies from product to product 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size and complexity of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
we have experienced in fiscal an overall lengthening of sales cycles as customers delayed purchases or customers reduced budgets as a result of economic conditions 
additionally  the emerging market for scm products and services contributes to the lengthy sales process in that during the sales cycle we often have to teach potential customers about the use and benefits of our products 
in certain circumstances  we license our software to customers on a trial basis to assist the customers in their evaluation of our products 
our sales cycle can be further extended for product sales made through third party distributors 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may affect our quarterly operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our software products 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending january are typically higher relative to our other quarters  because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements 
in addition  our january quarter tends to reflect the effect of the incentive compensation structure for our sales organization  which is based on satisfaction of fiscal year end quotas 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
we expect our quarter ending october to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year 
we may experience delays in developing our products which could adversely affect our business if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
we have experienced product development delays in new version and update releases in the past and may experience similar or more significant product delays in the future 
to date  none of these delays has materially affected our business 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products or the delivery of new versions of our products to our customers 
any delay in releasing our new distributed systems products  for whatever reason  would impair our revenue growth 
we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems in doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business expansion of international operations 
we intend to expand the scope of our international operations  although more slowly than in prior years  and currently have sales subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france and belgium 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  or if these operations experienced declining revenue growth  this could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
we have only limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products internationally 
additionally  we do not have any experience in developing foreign language versions of our products 
such development may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
risks of international operations 
international sales represented approximately of our total licenses revenue in the current fiscal year ended january   as compared to and in each of the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is a result of very weak economic conditions in europe 
our international revenue is attributable principally to our european operations 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations problems in collecting accounts receivable longer payment cycles fluctuations in currency exchange rates seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world recessionary environments in foreign economies increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena a majority of our international business is conducted in foreign currencies  principally the british pound and euro 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future quarterly and annual operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect serena from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
serena is subject to intense competition in the scm industry and we expect to face increased competition in the future  including competition in the scm distributed systems market we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and such inability would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
moreover  the technology for scm products may change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced  and existing products are continually enhanced 
competition may also result in changes in pricing policies by serena or our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
mainframe competition 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including customers internal it departments providers of scm products that compete directly with changeman zmf and comparex such as computer associates  merant  ibm and smaller private companies providers of scm application development programmer productivity and system management products such as compuware  ibm and smaller private companies competition in the distributed systems scm market 
we also face significant competition as we develop  market and sell our distributed systems products  including changeman ds  changeman alm  changeman ecp and changeman wcm 
if we are unable to successfully penetrate the distributed systems scm market  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results will be materially adversely affected 
penetrating the existing distributed systems scm market will be difficult 
competitors in the distributed systems market include rational software  computer associates  merant  microsoft  interwoven  documentum  vignette and other smaller private companies 
future competition 
we may face competition in the future from established companies who have not previously entered the mainframe scm market  from emerging software companies  or from other web content management software companies 
barriers to entry in the software market are relatively low 
increased competition may materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results due to price reductions  reduced gross margins and reduction in market share 
established companies may not only develop their own mainframe or distributed systems scm solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors  including cooperative relationships between large  established companies and smaller private companies 
because larger companies have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the mainframe or distributed systems scm market through acquisitions or strategic relationships and may be able to leverage the technology and expertise of smaller companies and develop successful scm products for the mainframe 
we expect that the software industry  in general  and providers of scm solutions  in particular  will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
bundling or compatibility risks 
our ability to sell our products also depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  particularly those provided by ibm 
developers of these third party products may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
these third party developers may also decide to bundle their products with other scm products for promotional purposes 
if that were to happen  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results may be materially adversely affected as we may be priced out of the market or no longer be able to offer commercially viable products 
we may be unable to successfully complete strategic relationships or acquisitions we may be unable to successfully complete strategic relationships or acquisitions in pursuit of our growth strategy 
one component of our growth strategy  entering into strategic relationships or the strategic acquisition of businesses  involves certain risks  including  among others  the following difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel disruption to our ongoing business inability of our management to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our product offerings inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies impairment of relationships with employees as a result of changes in management in addition  any such acquisition could materially adversely affect our financial results due to dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and the amortization of expenses or impairment of value related to goodwill and other intangible assets  if any 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and such officers and key personnel may not remain with serena in the future our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior executives and certain other key employees  including certain sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
if we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with serena  this could materially adversely affect our business 
in particular  we have historically relied on the experience and dedication of our product authors 
with the exception of douglas d 
troxel  serena s founder  chief technology officer and member of serena s board of directors  the employment of all of our senior and key employees  including key product authors  is at will 
mr 
troxel s employment is on a year to year basis 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technology standards and our future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms particularly for our distributed systems products 
we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
we expect that we will have to respond quickly to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
our share price has been  and will likely continue to be  volatile the market price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in recent months  and we expect that the market price of our common shares may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and market conditions 
these fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common shares is low 
in addition  the market price of our common shares may fluctuate dramatically in response to a variety of factors  including changes in estimates of our financial performance  shortfalls in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of direct competitors of the company  changes in analysts estimates of the company s financial performance  the financial performance of competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  general conditions in the software industry  changes in prices for the company s products or competitors products  changes in revenue growth rates for the company or its competitors  conditions in the financial markets  general market or economic conditions  the gain or loss of a significant customer or strategic relationship  changes in recommendations from securities analysts regarding us  our industry or our customers industries  announcements of technological or competitive developments  and acquisitions or entry into strategic alliances by us or our competitors 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  equity securities of many technology companies have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these price and volume fluctuations are sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
volatility in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action litigation 
this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
third parties in the future could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our business third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
any claims of this type could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent future customers from licensing our products 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of products  any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
as a result of these factors  infringement claims could materially adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced sales  technical  marketing and management personnel 
in addition  we will need to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified software engineers  as well as sales and marketing and support personnel  to successfully develop  market and support our distributed systems product suite 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially developers and sales personnel 
we expect competition for qualified personnel to remain intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining such personnel 
if we do not  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
this training will require substantial resources and management attention 
errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us because our software products are complex  they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software  we expect that errors in our products will continue to be found in the future 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  certain of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
these problems could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
in the past we have discovered errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
these delays have principally related to new version and product update releases 
to date none of these delays have materially affected our business 
however  product errors or delays in the future  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of our distributed systems products  could be material 
in addition  in certain cases we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to such specifications  customers could demand a refund for the software license fee paid to us or assert claims for damages 
product liability claims asserted against us in the future could adversely affect our business we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
a material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
serena s standard software licenses provide that if our products fail to perform  we will correct or replace such products 
if these corrective measures fail  we may be required to refund the license fee for such non performing product 
however  our standard license agreement limits our liability for non performing products to the amount of license fee paid  if the license has been in effect for less than one year  or to the amount of the licensee s current annual maintenance fee  if the license is more than one year old 
our standard license also provides that serena shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages caused by the failure of our products 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio and has no foreign exchange contracts 
its financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the company considers investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of the company s cash equivalents and short and long term investments principally consist of commercial paper and debt securities  and are classified as available for sale as of january  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term investments and short term obligations  thus  a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
sales to foreign countries accounted for approximately of the total sales for fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
because the company invoices certain of its foreign sales in currencies other than the united states dollar  predominantly the british pound sterling and euro  and does not hedge these transactions  fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect the translated results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  foreign exchange fluctuations could create a risk of significant balance sheet gains or losses on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  given the company s foreign subsidiaries net book values as of january  and net cash flows for the most recent fiscal year then ended  the company does not believe that a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although at january  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
