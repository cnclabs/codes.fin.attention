item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  pertaining generally to the expected continuation of our collaborative agreements  the receipt of research payments thereunder  the future achievement of various milestones in product development and the receipt of payments related thereto  the potential receipt of royalty payments  pre clinical testing and clinical trials of potential products  the period of time that our existing capital resources will meet our funding requirements  and our financial results of operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in this annual report on form k 
overview we incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in since we were founded  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products for neurologic and endocrine diseases and disorders 
many of our product candidates address some of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world  including insomnia  anxiety  depression  cancer  multiple sclerosis and diabetes 
to date  we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products  and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable future 
we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and payments received under research and development agreements 
we are developing a number of products with corporate collaborators and will rely on existing and future collaborators to meet funding requirements 
we expect to generate future net losses due to significant increases in operating expenses as product candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in the future  which may be greater than losses in prior years 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenues under collaborative research agreements and grants  clinical trial accruals r d expense  facility lease  investments  and fixed assets 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenues under collaborative research agreements and grants are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
these agreements are on a best efforts basis and do not require scientific achievement as a performance obligation and provide for payment to be made when costs are incurred or the services are performed 
all fees are nonrefundable to the collaborators 
up front  nonrefundable payments for license fees and advance payments for sponsored research revenues received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the period earned 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of pre defined scientific events 
revenues from government grants are recognized based on a percentage of completion basis as the related costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue only on payments that are nonrefundable and when the work is performed 
research and development r d expenses include related salaries  contractor fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to r d expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent r d efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations  grants and in licensing arrangements 
in addition  we fund r d at other companies and research institutions under agreements  which are generally cancelable 
we review and accrue clinical trials expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total hours incurred and completion of certain events 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made 
accrued clinical costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we lease our current facility under an operating lease that generally requires us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
based on the structure of the arrangement  our operating lease is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds up to of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the facility into a special purpose entity spe and leases the facility to a lessee 
at least of the third party funds represent at risk equity 
if at any time the third party fails to maintain at least at risk equity  we will need to consolidate the spe  which will result in debt and equity being recorded in our financial statements 
our synthetic lease is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes and a financing lease for tax purposes 
we selected the synthetic lease for the financing advantages 
also  the agreement provides that at our option  we may purchase the building by repaying the first mortgage balance 
we periodically review the fair value of the property leased to determine potential accounting ramifications 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to dispose 
results of operations for years ended december   and our revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million in  and million in the increase in revenues from to was primarily the result of the taisho and gsk collaborations  which were effective july and july  respectively 
under the taisho agreement  we recognized million during compared with million in under the gsk agreement  we recognized million during  which included a million milestone achievement 
the increase in revenues from these agreements was partially offset by the completion of the sponsored research portion of the janssen agreement 
these activities concluded  as scheduled  in february under the janssen agreement  we recognized  during and million during the decline in revenues from to resulted primarily from the conclusion of a collaboration with novartis in january and the sponsored research portion of a collaboration with eli lilly in october during  we received million in revenues under these agreements  in addition to million in milestones under the agreement with wyeth ayerst 
the absence of these revenues during was partially offset by million in revenues from taisho 
in addition  revenues recognized from janssen were million in compared to million recognized in research and development expenses increased to million during compared with million during and million in increased expenses reflect advancement of our drug candidates through progressive clinical development phases 
we expect to incur significant increases in future periods as later phases of development typically involve an increase in the scope of studies  the number of patients treated and the number of scientific personnel required to manage the trials 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during compared with million during and million during the increase in administrative expenses from to resulted primarily from additional patent legal expenses  marketing research and the addition of administrative personnel needed to support expanding research and development activities 
the increase in expenses from to resulted primarily from approximately million in business development consulting primarily relating to the taisho agreement and million of non cash stock compensation charges relating to the employee stock purchase program and consultant stock options 
interest income increased to million during compared with million during and million during the increase in  compared with and  primarily resulted from higher investment balances achieved through public and private offerings of our common stock 
in december  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds of million 
in december  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering resulting in net proceeds of million 
and  in december  we sold million shares of our common stock in a private placement resulting in net proceeds of million 
in december  we sold our investment in npi and recorded a gain of  our proportionate share of npi operating losses during was  in addition  we recorded a write down in the investment value of  during relating to the decline in cash redemption value of the npi preferred shares 
other income consists primarily of sublease income from unrelated parties 
the fluctuations in sublease income from year to year reflect facility capacity in excess of our needs 
excess space is subleased until it is needed to support company growth 
during  we expect sublease income to decrease significantly as increases in personnel will require us to use more office and laboratory space 
our net loss for was million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the increase in net loss primarily resulted from an increase in scientific personnel and expanded clinical development activities 
we expect operating losses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our clinical development efforts 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million compared with million at december  the increase in cash balances from december  to december  resulted from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering  which generated net cash proceeds of million 
the increase in cash was offset by net cash used in operating activities during net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year was million compared with million in and million during the increase in cash used in operations for compared to the prior periods resulted primarily from the increase in clinical development activities and the addition of scientific and clinical development personnel 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year was million compared to million during and million in these fluctuations resulted primarily from the timing differences in investment purchases  sales  maturities and the fluctuations in our portfolio mix between cash equivalents and short term investment holdings 
we expect similar fluctuations to continue in future periods 
capital equipment purchases for  and were million  million and million  respectively  and were financed primarily through capital leasing arrangements 
capital equipment purchases for also will be financed primarily through leasing agreements and are expected to be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million compared with million in and million during cash provided during  and includes net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock of million  million and million  respectively 
factors that may affect future financial condition and liquidity we anticipate significant increases in expenditures as we continue to expand our research and development activities 
because of our limited financial resources  our strategies to develop some of our programs include collaborative agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and sales of our common stock in both public and private offerings 
our collaborative agreements typically include a partial recovery of our research costs through license fees  contract research funding and milestone revenues 
our collaborators are also financially and managerially responsible for clinical development and commercialization 
in these cases  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of the collaborator 
we cannot forecast  with any degree of certainty  which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
our license  research and clinical development agreements are generally cancelable with written notice in days 
in addition to the minimum payments due under our license and research agreements  we may be required to pay up to million in milestone payments  plus sales royalties  in the event that all scientific research under these agreements is successful 
some of our clinical development agreements contain incentives for time sensitive activities 
less than after contractual obligations total year years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations    operating lease     license research agreements  clinical development agreements    total contractual obligations     the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   seven of our product candidates were in various stages of clinical trials 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is also important to note that if a clinical candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  safety or a change in market demand 
an important element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a diverse range of product candidates for a variety of disease indications 
we pursue this goal through proprietary research and development as well as searching for new technologies for licensing opportunities 
this allows us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a diverse and broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
the nature and efforts required to develop our product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  pre clinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process may cost in excess of million and can take as long as years to complete for each product candidate 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify disease indications for which our product candidates may show efficacy 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following o we or the fda may suspend the trials  o we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects  o the results may not replicate the results of earlier  smaller trials  o the results may not be statistically significant  o patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and o patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  we may not be successful in achieving commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we also may be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  o the magnitude of our research and development programs  o progress with pre clinical testing and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  o the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments  o the establishment of additional strategic alliances  o the cost of manufacturing facilities and of commercialization activities and arrangements  and o the cost of product in licensing and any possible acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest income and future payments due under our strategic alliances  will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot guarantee that these capital resources and payments will be sufficient to conduct our research and development programs as planned 
the amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors  including progress of our research and development programs 
we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  the cost of product in licensing and any possible acquisitions  and we may require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms  potentially including off balance sheet financing 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
we expect to incur operating losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical studies and clinical trial activities increase 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality government and other debt securities 
to minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and ensure that the maximum average maturity of our investments does not exceed months 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful continuation of our strategic collaborations  the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties
