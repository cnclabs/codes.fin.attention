restructuring and other expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of directors approved a plan to restructure certain operations to more closely align the company s capabilities and capacities with changing market requirements and economic conditions as well as position the company with a more competitive cost structure vital for overall long term success 
the following actions took place related to the plan closed four furniture and cabinet manufacturing facilities  a company owned energy center and an administrative office location  all in the united states 
scaled capacities at additional manufacturing locations allowing for consolidation and or alignment of operations in reaction to  or in anticipation of  changing market conditions 
the activities associated with this plan were substantially complete as of june  as a result of the above outlined activities  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges in fiscal year  which net to million

approximately hourly and salaried employees were affected by the restructuring plan and have been redeployed or released from the company as of june  as of june   million in restructuring reserves remain  which appears adequate to cover remaining committed restructuring actions to finalize the plan 
primary remaining actions include the sale or sub lease of three idle manufacturing facilities in the furniture and cabinets segment and the sale of an electronics manufacturing facility in france 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding restructuring 
management estimated that once the restructuring plan was complete  these actions  along with cost reduction efforts that were taken beginning in mid fiscal year to right size its workforce in response to lower sales volumes  would generate annual pre tax savings of approximately to million 
it is estimated the majority of the cost savings are being realized 
a large part of the savings is related to the right sizing of the workforce to the lower volume levels  which can be expected to fluctuate with future sales volumes 
part of the savings is being redeployed into strategic initiatives designed to accelerate top line revenue growth and quality and efficiency improvements

exclusive of current and prior year restructuring charges and the gain on the sale of the boesendorfer piano subsidiary  net income declined from a year ago 
pre tax restructuring charges of million were recorded in the furniture and cabinets segment in fiscal primarily as a result of plant consolidation costs and additional asset write downs 
a double digit percentage sales decline in all the major product lines within this segment is the primary reason for the decline in net income from a year ago 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  increased from fiscal resulting from lower material and labor costs  as a percent of sales 
overhead costs  as a percent of sales  increased in fiscal year over the prior year as the reduction in sales outpaced cost reductions 
also contributing to the improved margins in this segment in fiscal year  compared to the prior year  were inventory reduction initiatives that resulted in a liquidation of lifo last in  first out inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years  the effect of which increased net income by approximately million or per class b share 
the furniture components product line continues to negatively affect the profitability in this segment as fiscal bottom line results were impacted by the significant sales volume reduction in dimension and lumber products compared to the prior year 
market conditions within the furniture components product line remain very challenging based on depressed demand levels and pressures on lumber and veneer commodity prices due  in part  to excess capacity within this market 
improvement in this product line is dependent upon the company achieving its planned higher volume levels and associated improvements in operating efficiencies

sales of medical components and industrial controls also increased over the prior year while sales of telecommunication and computer related products declined compared to a year ago 
the contract electronics manufacturing industry in general has been faced with excess capacity due to the slowing economy 
the company has not been immune and continually evaluates its operations as to the most optimum capacity and service levels by geographic region 
net income in fiscal year increased over fiscal year  however  when excluding current and prior year restructuring charges  a prior year charge for impaired goodwill unrelated to the restructuring  and operations from the new auburn facility  net income declined from last year 
pre tax restructuring income of million was recorded in fiscal related primarily to adjustments to original cost estimates 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  declined in fiscal year from the prior year  largely related to operational inefficiencies on the production of new products primarily at the company s poznan  poland operation 
the current year auburn facility acquisition provided positive bottom line contribution along with new product and customer diversification 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat  as a percent of sales  with the prior year 
lower selling expenses  largely related to a prior year write down of accounts receivable associated with a financially unstable contract customer  offset increases in administrative costs and incentive compensation costs  which are linked to company profitability

sales to this customer accounted for and of the total sales in the electronic contract assemblies segment in fiscal and  respectively 
trw in turn sells complete braking assemblies  in part manufactured by the company  to several major automotive companies  most with multiple braking assembly programs that span multiple vehicles  which partially mitigates the company s exposure to a single customer 
the nature of the contract electronics manufacturing industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program which is offset by higher profitability as the program matures and becomes established 
presently  the company has a higher concentration of new customer and program start ups than in prior years due to its focused customer and program diversification efforts and capability expansion  both domestically and internationally  which reduced current year earnings 
this segment s operations carry a higher degree of risk than the company s other segment due to increased globalization  rapid technological changes  component availability  capacity utilization given the contract nature of this industry  and the importance of established program sales to one customer

gross profit  as a percent of sales  declined from fiscal largely due to an increase in labor and overhead costs  as a percent of sales 
increased depreciation expense along with higher expenditures for freight and utilities associated with higher energy costs were the largest contributors to the increased overhead costs 
the furniture components product line and the contract furniture and cabinets line primarily drove the lower gross margins in this segment 
lower sales volumes and continued start up challenges and associated inefficiencies at the company s veneer mill in chandler  indiana drove the lower margins within the furniture components line 
lower margins in the contract furniture and cabinets product line were primarily the result of reduced manufacturing efficiencies including those at the company s projection television cabinet operation in juarez  mexico 
an overall shift in sales mix to lower margined products within this segment also contributed to the lower overall profitability compared to the prior year

gross profits were lower in fiscal year  largely as a result of charges for excess and obsolete material related to select contract based customers 
product mix changes within and among the product lines in this segment  resulting partly from a planned diversification of its customer base into a variety of new products  also contributed to the lower gross profitability in fiscal year additionally  charges related to the write down of custom equipment and working capital associated with a financially unstable contract customer impacted operating results in fiscal year on the positive side  this segment s recent global expansion initiatives proved successful in fiscal year with a significant favorable contribution to the prior year net income comparison 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in both dollars and as a percent of sales in fiscal year driven by lower absolute selling expenses and incentive compensation  which is linked to company profitability 
included in this segment are sales to one customer  trw  inc  which accounted for and of consolidated net sales in fiscal year and  respectively 
sales to this customer represented approximately one half of total sales in the electronic contract assemblies segment in fiscal years and consolidated operations consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in both dollars and as a percent of sales  percentage point  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this reduction in selling  general and administrative costs is primarily due to lower absolute selling expenses and lower incentive compensation costs  which are linked to company profitability

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgement in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience  and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
kimball management overlays a fundamental philosophy of valuing its assets and liabilities in an appropriately conservative manner 
a summary of kimball s significant accounting policies is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgements and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  and or  are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and with the company s independent auditors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk transfer to the customer  which is generally when the product is shipped 
guidelines regarding revenue recognition are strictly adhered to and volatility resulting from estimates or judgement is minimal 
allowance for sales returns at the time revenue is recognized certain provisions may also be recorded  including returns and allowances  which involve estimates based on current discussions with applicable customers  historical experience with a particular customer and or product  and other relevant factors 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the provisions to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june  the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
historically  over the past three years  the returns and allowances reserve has been approximately of gross trade receivables 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on a percentage of aged receivables  where the percentage increases as the receivables become older 
however  management judgement is utilized in the final determination of the allowance based on several factors including specific analysis of a customer s credit worthiness  changes in a customer s payment history  historical bad debt experience  and general economic and market trends 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  and was million and million  respectively  and over the past three years this reserve has trended between approximately and of gross trade receivables 
excess and obsolete inventory inventories were valued using the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market value for approximately and of consolidated inventories in and  respectively  including approximately and of the furniture and cabinets segment inventories in and  respectively 
the remaining inventories are valued at lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market value 
fifo inventory recorded on the company s balance sheet is adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory 
in general  the company purchases materials for contract based business from customer orders and projections  primarily in the case of long lead time items  and is transitioning to a general philosophy to only purchase materials to the extent covered by a written commitment from its customers 
however  there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments where minimal lot sizes  component allocation or other component procurement issues may exist 
evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels  and product demand levels 
factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage  use as showroom samples  design changes or cessation of product lines 
these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability  workers compensation and certain employee health benefits including medical  short term disability and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s policy is to estimate reserves based upon periodic actuarial valuations  and known or estimated future claims 
the company uses independent outside actuaries to assist in the valuation of medical reserves on an annual basis and on a bi annual basis for workers compensation 
actuarial studies support the development of claim growth factors  including factors for incurred but not reported claims  which are then applied to the company s actual claims history 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
ultimately  the company adjusts its reserve levels to align with these periodic independent actuarial studies 
changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and the company s accrued liabilities for self insurance exposure was million and million  respectively  excluding amounts funded in a voluntary employees beneficiary association veba trust

fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of fas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning july  fas establishes a single model to account for impairment of assets to be held or disposed  incorporating guidelines for accounting and disclosure of discontinued operations

as a result of this adoption of eitf  the company now reflects all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as sales while the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
prior to the adoption of eitf some fees and costs were netted in selling  general and administrative expenses

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are stated at market value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded net of tax related effect  if any  as a component of share owners equity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates from levels at june  and would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
the company operates internationally  and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
the effect of movements in the exchange rates was not material to the consolidated operating results of the company in fiscal years and the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect the consolidated operating results of the company by a material amount
