item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of million for fiscal this compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  on sales of million in fiscal clearly  this was a challenging year for knape vogt kv 
kv felt the impact of the overall economic downturn in the us across all of the markets that it serves 
this was especially true in the office furniture market  which posted its most significant shipment decline in recent history  with a decrease of approximately for the month period ended june kv addressed the challenges presented by reorganizing its sales  marketing and new product development efforts to better focus on its two key business segments office products and home and commercial products 
it also emphasized its commitment to bringing fresh  innovative product and service solutions to these markets  while still using lean manufacturing techniques in its own operations to help maintain a competitive cost structure 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon kv s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates and complexity include the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  net book value of long lived assets and pension and other post retirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of kv s revenue recognition policy 
kv uses the following methods and assumptions in its estimates 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable kv records allowances for losses that it may incur from the inability of certain of its customers to pay for products or services that they have purchased 
in determining these allowances  kv takes into consideration the financial condition of its customers  previous payment history and the age of the outstanding balances 
kv monitors its customers balances on a monthly basis and assesses the adequacy of the allowances recorded 
inventory reserves kv provides reserves for inventory that it deems to be obsolete or slow moving utilizing assumptions about future demand for its products 
kv monitors its inventory by type  age and usage on a monthly basis to determine the reserves recorded 
net book value of long lived assets kv periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
this review is performed using estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in computing such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for kv s employee retirement plans 
results of operations the table below shows certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales june  jun e  july  year ended net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring and impairment of assets 
operating income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income sales in march  the company announced the creation of two business segments office products and home and commercial products 
the office products segment develops  markets and distributes its hardware and idea work brand of ergonomic products primarily to office furniture oems and office furniture dealers 
the home and commercial products segment develops  markets and distributes hardware  kitchen and storage solutions primarily to retailers  specialty distributors and kitchen oems 
these products include the real solutions for real life brand of storage products 
kv substantially completed this realignment of its structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the reorganization  restatement of prior years operating segment results is impracticable  however  segment revenue is shown below 
june  june  july  year ended in million s office products home and commercial products total gross sales consolidated net sales for fiscal declined compared to fiscal the office products segment experienced the most significant decline in sales 
this segment sells ergonomic products along with hardware components including precision drawer slides to several of the large office furniture oems 
as a result of the downturn in that industry during fiscal  there was a significant decline in orders from these customers 
the increase in fiscal sales for this segment represented the growth of the ergonomic product line  which was acquired in the previous fiscal year 
the home and commercial segment has seen the impact of the overall economic downturn in its sales volumes 
new product sales those products introduced within the last months served to partially offset the impact of the downturn in the us economy 
new product sales in fiscal were approximately million  which was more than double the amount in fiscal new products introductions allowed kv to continue to grow its idea work line of ergonomic products and increase its market share  despite the significant decline in the overall office furniture industry 
in addition  kv introduced more than two dozen new products during its two major trade shows held in the fourth quarter of fiscal these introductions included the new height adjustable table line that kv acquired the rights to manufacture during the third quarter of fiscal net sales in fiscal were million 
this represented a decline from fiscal the overall weakness in the us economy  especially during the second half of fiscal  was the primary reason for the decline 
despite the softness in the overall office furniture and storage related markets  the company s ergonomic product line grew substantially  more than doubling the sales volume from fiscal the company successfully launched several new products  including an ergonomic lighting line and several next generation products in both drawer slides and kitchen and bath accessories 
most of these products were introduced to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal  so the impact on net sales was modest 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal overall  the company has a significant investment in its manufacturing process  specifically machinery and tooling 
with the decrease in sales volumes during fiscal and  it has been more difficult to effectively leverage the fixed portion of these costs 
kv has been at least partially successful in offsetting this decline in gross margin by the use of lean manufacturing initiatives to minimize manufacturing costs and by increasing sales of higher margin products such as the line of ergonomic products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in both fiscal and was caused primarily by the higher level of selling costs associated with the ergonomic product line than the company s other product lines 
in addition  the company has increased its level of research and development efforts and the marketing costs associated with the launch of the new products generated from these efforts 
restructuring impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
for certain precision drawer slide tooling 
while kv will continue to produce the drawer slides  the future cash flows associated with the sales of this particular product line were less than the cost of the tooling recorded 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  kv adopted a plan to reduce its salaried workforce in its grand rapids  michigan facility 
the company recorded  in severance costs for this workforce reduction 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax impairment loss on assets held for sale of 
million 
the loss reflected new information  which lowered the company s estimate of the fair market value of the properties listed for sale 
in fiscal  the company had recorded a loss of 
million  which was its best estimate at that time of the loss to be incurred on the sale of the company s former powder coat facility 
the assets held for sale were sold during fiscal at no additional loss to the company 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal years and overall  interest expense has remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years 
slight variations reflect the impact of higher or lower balances outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal overall  rates have varied slightly due to the ratio of foreign versus domestic income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share in fiscal the declines in both fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to the decrease in overall sales volume 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities generated million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal represented an improvement in the change in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities when compared to the prior year 
the decline in fiscal resulted in part from a decrease in net income  lower accounts payable levels due to a decrease in overall purchases and a decrease in payroll related accruals  which were variable with the company s performance 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal kv spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal and the expenditures in fiscal and fiscal were primarily for improvements in the company s manufacturing processes and tooling for new products 
while kv continued to invest capital in connection with new product development  management concluded that the investments in the manufacturing process were sufficient in the prior two fiscal years to meet the anticipated capacity needs for at least the next three to five years 
management believes that capital expenditures will approximate the level of depreciation in fiscal  as investments will be focused on bringing new products and product enhancements to the company s customers 
the cost to complete the items classified as construction in progress at june  was estimated to be approximately  which will be derived from cash flows from operations or from the revolving credit facility

on october   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of idea 
idea designed  manufactured and marketed ergonomic products  including adjustable keyboard mechanisms  keyboard and computer mouse platforms  wrist rests and cpu holders 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
the cost of the acquisition in excess of net identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and has been amortized using the straight line method based on a year life 
the company will discontinue the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  as the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no
