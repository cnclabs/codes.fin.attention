item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts throughout this item are in thousands  except per share amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition defective products returns and other allowances we recognize revenue from product sales when title passes and all the rewards and risk of loss have been transferred and all the criteria for revenue recognition described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b are met 
we must make estimates for defective product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
we record a provision for defective product returns and other allowances based upon past experience and the receipt of notification of pending returns 
while the returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the product return rate will remain constant 
any significant increase in the product return rate and resulting reduction in our net sales could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the returns materialize 
accounts receivable allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore must estimate losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as noted in note of the consolidated financial statements  we have a credit risk concentration  due to the concentration of our domestic saucony footwear sales amongst a relatively small customer base 
if the liquidity or financial condition of any of our larger customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments due us or if payment schedules of our customers are otherwise delayed from historical trends  additional allowances might be required  which could materially increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or the current estimated market value 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory  equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  must be estimated by us 
our provision is based upon estimated product demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional provisions to write down inventory may be required  which could materially reduce our amount of current assets 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions that we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish valuation allowances when we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from operating losses will not be realized 
during fiscal  we recorded deferred tax valuation allowances of united states federal tax laws allow companies to defer the recognition of tax liability on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operation 
at january   we had approximately  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations for which we have not recorded deferred income taxes

saucony segment net sales    compared to worldwide net sales of saucony branded footwear and saucony branded apparel decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in footwear unit volumes and lower domestic and international wholesale per pair average sell prices

the lower average wholesale selling prices per pair is due to higher unit volumes of closeout footwear and special make up footwear  both of which sell at prices below our first quality technical footwear 
sales of closeout footwear accounted for approximately of domestic saucony net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the originals footwear accounted for of fiscal domestic footwear unit volume versus in fiscal the unit volume decrease in originals footwear is primarily due to a shift in consumer preference to other product categories  primarily basketball footwear  which we do not sell 
during the second half of fiscal  the order cancellation rate for our saucony footwear decreased from the order cancellation rate in the first half of fiscal and was comparable with our historical average 
international net sales increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to a increase in footwear unit volumes  partially offset by lower average per pair wholesale selling prices and the negative impact of the stronger us dollar against european currencies 
footwear unit volumes increased at our international distributor business and at our european and canadian subsidiaries  respectively  in fiscal versus fiscal the footwear unit volume increase in our international distributor business is due primarily to the success of our originals footwear product in the japanese footwear market in  which accounted for approximately of the international distributor unit volume increase  and increased market penetration in the pacific rim

international net sales of other products increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due to increased hind apparel sales in europe 
costs and expenses our gross margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to the significant decline in saucony domestic sales of first quality footwear products at full margin 
other factors contributing to the fiscal margin decrease were proportionately higher sales of closeout products  due to our decision to reduce inventory levels and of special make up footwear  both of which carry lower margins and  to a lesser extent  manufacturing inefficiencies  domestic pricing pressures  changes in the geographic mix of sales and the negative impact of the us dollar on our european margins 
for the fiscal year  the gross margin decreased to  from in fiscal  due primarily to a change in domestic saucony product mix to higher levels of closeout sales at comparatively lower margins  domestic pricing pressures  increased inventory reserves and  to a lesser extent  the negative impact of the stronger us dollar on our european margins and a change in the saucony international sales mix to increased distributor sales

the higher provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal in comparison with fiscal was due primarily to the bankruptcy filing by just for feet  inc plant closing and other non recurring charges on november  we announced the cessation of manufacturing and closing of our bangor  maine facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we relocated our asian sourcing and quality control office to china  resulting in the closure of our taiwan office and negotiated an early termination and exit of a retail store lease 
as a result of these actions  we recorded pre tax non recurring charges of  or  after tax or per diluted share after tax 
the closing of our bangor  maine facility in january resulted in the termination of employees  of which were terminated subsequent to january  assets used by our bangor  maine manufacturing facility  the taiwan office and our retail store have been written down to fair market value

income loss before taxes segment saucony   other products   consolidated   we evaluate business performance and the performance of key managers based on profit or loss before income taxes 
income before tax decreased by  in fiscal to a loss of compared to a profit of  in fiscal  due primarily to the significant reduction in the domestic saucony segment due to lower sales and lower gross margins and  to a lesser extent  non recurring charges of  incurred in connection with the closure of our bangor  maine manufacturing facility  early termination and exit of a retail store outlet and the closure of our taiwan office 
income before tax decreased by  in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal  due primarily to the loss on the sale of the cycling division  which impacted the other products segment  and lower domestic pre tax income realized by the domestic saucony segment due to lower gross margins and higher selling expenses  partially offset by improved profitability in our saucony international and hind apparel business 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in domestic pre tax income  offset partially by an increase in deferred valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized and a shift in the composition of domestic and foreign pre tax earnings 
the provision for income taxes decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to the loss on the sale of the cycling division which reduced domestic pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a shift in the composition of domestic and foreign pre tax earnings and an increase in deferred valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized 
net income loss the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal the plant closing and other non recurring charges reduced net income and diluted earnings per share by  and  respectively in fiscal excluding the effect of the non recurring charges  our net income would have been  or per diluted share

our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal  due primarily to a reduction in payment date sales terms due to increased sales of special make up and closeout footwear and increased foreign distributor volume  of which dating programs are shorter 
in addition  the increased provisions for doubtful accounts reduced days sales outstanding by approximately two days in fiscal the provision for bad debts and discounts increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
inventories decreased  in fiscal due primarily to our decision to reduce domestic saucony footwear inventories  which had increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to increased order cancellations  and lower factory outlet inventories  which had increased due to the expansion of the factory outlet division 
the increase in domestic saucony footwear inventory in fiscal resulted from increased order cancellations in the fourth quarter of for both technical and originals footwear 
the decision to reduce domestic saucony footwear inventories negatively impacted fiscal gross margins 
our inventory turns ratio decreased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal principal factors other than net income  accounts receivable  provision for bad debts and discounts and inventory affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal included a decrease of  in accrued letters of credit due to new inventory supplier payment terms  an increase of  in accounts payable due to a change in inventory purchase terms  a decrease of  in accrued expenses due to decreased performance based compensation accruals and lower operating spending levels  and an increase of in income tax payable due to the timing of income tax payments

fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from december  the increase was due primarily to the generation of  of cash from operations  the receipt of  from the sale of our former cycling division and an increase of in short term borrowings  principally under our credit facilities 
this increase was partially offset by cash outlays for capital assets of  the repurchase of shares of our common stock of  and the repayment of long term debt of the increase in accounts receivable of  net of the provision for bad debt and discounts  was due primarily to increased net sales of our saucony and other products in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable 
our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable increased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal  due primarily to the reserve of  provided for on the receivable due from just for feet  inc in fiscal  which reduced the fiscal days sales outstanding by days  and  to a lesser extent  the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories increased  in fiscal due to increased domestic saucony footwear inventory  increased hind apparel inventory and increased inventory at the our factory outlet stores  due to the net addition of two stores in the increase in domestic saucony footwear inventory resulted from increased order cancellations in the fourth quarter of for both technical and originals footwear 
our inventory turns ratio remained constant at turns for both fiscal and fiscal the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal principal factors other than net income  accounts receivable  provision for bad debts and discounts and inventory affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal included an increase of  in accrued letters of credit due to increased direct ship inventory purchases  a decrease of  in accrued expenses due to decreased performance based compensation accruals and the payment of expenses resulting from the cycling division divestiture  a decrease of in accounts payables due to the timing of inventory purchases and a decrease of in income taxes payable due to domestic tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for a total expenditure of  of which was financed with borrowed funds 
at january   this borrowing and accrued interest thereon of are included in notes payable 
credit facility we maintain a revolving credit line of  for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
we reduced the amount available for cash borrowings and letters of credit under the credit facility from  to  in february we and certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility is unsecured 
the credit facility contains certain restrictions and financial covenants with which we are required to comply  whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding 
the credit facility has been extended through june  under the most restrictive covenant  we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  as of january  the credit facility is also subject to the bank s periodic review of our operations 
we may not pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of common stock without the consent of our primary lender under the credit facility 
as of january  and march    and  respectively  were available for borrowing under the credit facility 
in february  our primary lender amended the definition of ebit  earnings before interest and taxes under the credit facility 
the amendment modified the calculation of minimum interest expense coverage in relation to ebit to exclude the non recurring charges of  incurred by us in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amendment applied with the minimum interest expense coverage covenant under the credit facility with respect to the fiscal quarters ended january  and april  we were in compliance with all other covenants of the credit facility at january  several of our foreign subsidiaries maintain credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  at march  an aggregate of approximately  was available for borrowing under the facilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures commitments at january   our commitments for capital expenditures were not material 
contractual obligations below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commitments at january  payments due by year contractual and obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases     other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations      other long term obligations include athlete and event sponsorship and employment contracts with two key executives 
overall liquidity our liquidity is contingent upon a number of factors  principally our future operating results 
management believes that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and to fund our capital investment needs and debt service payments in the near term 
during fiscal we generated  in cash from operating cash flows  due primarily to a decrease in our accounts receivable and inventories 
in  we generated  in cash from operating cash flows 
as of january   we had  in accounts receivable and  in inventories 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and had due under capital leases 
our short term liquidity could potentially be adversely impacted should demand for our products decline significantly  which could result in extended payment terms for our customers and the increased use of price concessions to induce customers to purchase our products 
since july   the original expiration date of our primary credit facility  our lender has extended the facility on several occasions 
the credit facility is scheduled to terminate on june  our ability to fund future operations could be adversely impacted if we are not able to renew this credit facility under the current terms and conditions 
in addition  although we are currently in compliance with the effective covenants under the credit facility  if we were to fall out of compliance with those covenants or the covenants under a renewal of the facility  the credit facility would not be available to us and our lender may declare a default under the credit facility 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on our results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on our purchase of inventory from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
we are  however  subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign currency denominated payables 
during fiscal the gross margins of our european subsidiaries were negatively impacted due to currency fluctuation 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize certain transaction currency risks 
we believe that our forward foreign currency contracts function as economic hedges of our cash flows and that our foreign exchange management program effectively minimizes certain transaction currency risks

special note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language elsewhere in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements 
certain other factors that may affect future results we face intense competition competition is intense in the markets in which we sell our products 
we compete with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which are large organizations with diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than ours 
the principal competitors for our saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors of our hind products are nike  pearl izumi and tyr 
we compete based on a variety of factors  including price  product style  durability and quality  product design and technical performance  brand image and awareness  marketing and promotion and the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a technological breakthrough or marketing or promotional success by one of our competitors could adversely affect our competitive position 
the intensity of the competition that we face constitutes a significant risk to our business 
we depend on foreign suppliers a number of manufacturers located in asia  primarily in china  supply products to us 
during fiscal  one of our suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of our total footwear purchases by dollar volume 
we are subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  administrative trade cases  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our foreign suppliers and compete with other athletic shoe and apparel companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
we need to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and merchandise trends the footwear and apparel industries are subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
demand for our products  particularly our originals line  may be adversely affected by changing fashion trends and consumer style preferences 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
in addition  our decisions concerning new product designs often need to be made several months before we can determine consumer acceptance 
as a result  our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or features could lead to problems such as excess inventories and higher markdowns  lower gross margins due to the necessity of providing discounts to retailers and the inability to sell such products through our own factory outlet stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our revenues and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including o the timing and shipment of individual orders  o market acceptance of footwear and other products offered by us  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o mix of products sold  o changes in product pricing  o general economic conditions  and  o weather 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact our results of operations for a particular quarter 
our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we conduct operations in various international countries  and a portion of our sales is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  our financial results have been adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to protect us from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful  and currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns the athletic and casual footwear and athletic apparel industries in which we compete are generally characterized by significant seasonality of sales and results of operations 
sales of our saucony brand products have historically been seasonal in nature  with the strongest sales generally occurring in the first and third quarters 
in addition  sales of our hind brand products are generally strongest in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that sales of our products will continue to follow this seasonal cycle 
therefore  our results of operations for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
our operating results may be affected by order cancellations customers may cancel orders of our products at any time without financial penalty 
as a result  our backlog does not necessarily represent actual future shipments 
the rate of customer cancellations can vary quarter to quarter and year to year 
if the retail market continues to be weak or weakens again in the future  our customers could cancel further orders of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are susceptible to financial difficulties of retailers we sell our products primarily to major retailers  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect the future financial condition of such retailers will have on our business 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that our bad debt expenses will not be material in future periods 
we need effective marketing and advertising programs because consumer demand for our products is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising 
failure of such investments to achieve the desired effect in terms of increased retailer acceptance or consumer purchase of our products could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we believe that our success depends in part upon our ability to periodically launch new marketing and advertising programs 
if we are unable to successfully design or execute new marketing and advertising  or if such programs are ineffective  our business will suffer 
we depend on certain key customers approximately of our gross trade receivables balance was represented by customers at january  we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will depend to a significant extent upon sales to major customers 
the loss of or a reduction in the level of sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a major customer were unable or unwilling to proceed with a large order or to pay us for a large order on a timely basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business our business is sensitive to consumers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions  such as interest and taxation rates  employment levels and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the impact of these changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in order to achieve these objectives we identify the risks and manage them by adjusting fixed and variable rate debt positions and selectively hedging foreign currency risks 
almost all of our borrowings are based on floating rates  which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
we have a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  but there are no assurances that this program will fully insulate us against short term fluctuations in financial results 
the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of january  was  we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a one month period from january  and also a change in certain foreign currency rates over the same period and determined the effects to be immaterial 
we do not expect to make any significant changes in our management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the foreseeable future
