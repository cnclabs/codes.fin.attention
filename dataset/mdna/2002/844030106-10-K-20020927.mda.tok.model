results of operations net earnings southern union company s fiscal year ended june net earnings were  
per common share  diluted for outstanding options and warrants hereafter referred to as per share  compared with

these items were partially offset by  in after tax gains generated from the settlement of interest rate swaps 
net earnings in also reflect the absence of significant sales of the company s holdings in capstone turbine corporation and real estate  which generated after tax gains of  in in addition  net earnings in reflect goodwill amortization of  while goodwill amortization ceased in as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement 
average common and common share equivalents outstanding decreased in due to the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock 
substantially all of these repurchases occurred in private off market large block transactions 
the company s net earnings were  
per share  compared with  
per share in net earnings for the year ended june  were positively impacted by the sale of a portion of southern union s holdings in capstone turbine corporation realizing after tax gains of  net earnings in also reflect the acquisition of the new england operations that contributed  in net earnings 
while operating margin benefited from weather that was colder than  purchased gas costs increased over in compared with the prior year resulting in an increase in bad debt expense of  net of tax 
average common and common share equivalents outstanding increased in due to the issuance of  shares and  shares  before adjustment for any subsequent stock dividends  of the company s common stock in connection with the acquisition of fall river gas and the pennsylvania operations  respectively 
operating revenues operating revenues in compared with decreased  or  to  while gas purchase and other energy costs decreased  or  to  the decrease in both operating revenues and gas purchase and other energy costs between periods was primarily due to a decrease in gas sales volumes to  mmcf in from  mmcf in and by a decrease in the average cost of gas from per mcf in to per mcf in the decrease in gas sales volumes is primarily due to warmer than normal weather in all of the company s service territories as compared to colder than normal weather in the decrease in the average cost of gas is due to decreases in average spot market gas prices throughout the company s distribution system as a result of seasonal impacts on demands for natural gas as well as the current competitive pricing occurring within the entire energy industry 
additionally impacting operating revenues in was a  decrease in gross receipt taxes primarily due to a decrease in gas purchase and other energy costs 
gross receipt taxes are levied on sales revenues billed to the customers and remitted to the various taxing authorities 
the decrease in operating revenues in was partially offset by the timing of the acquisition of the new england operations in september  as well as the  annual revenue increase granted to missouri gas energy effective august and the  annual revenue increase granted to pg energy effective january gas purchase costs generally do not directly affect earnings since these costs are passed on to customers pursuant to purchase gas adjustment pga clauses 
accordingly  while changes in the cost of gas may cause the company s operating revenues to fluctuate  operating margin is generally not affected by increases or decreases in the cost of gas 
increases in gas purchase costs indirectly affect earnings as the customer s bill increases  usually resulting in increased bad debt and collection costs being recorded by the company 
gas transportation volumes in increased mmcf to  mmcf at an average transportation rate per mcf of 
in both and operating revenues in compared with increased  or  to  while gas purchase and other energy costs increased  or  to  the increase in both operating revenues and gas purchase and other energy costs between periods was primarily due to a increase in gas sales volumes to  mmcf in from  mmcf in and by a increase in the average cost of gas from per mcf in to per mcf in the increase in the average cost of gas was due to increases in average spot market gas prices throughout the company s distribution system as a result of seasonal impacts on demands for natural gas 
the acquisition of the new england operations contributed  to the overall increase in operating revenues   in gas purchase and other energy costs and  mmcf of the increase in gas sales volume 
the pennsylvania operations generated a net increase from to of  in operating revenues   in gas purchase and other energy costs  and  mmcf of the increase in gas sales volume 
additionally impacting operating revenues in was a  increase in gross receipt taxes primarily due to an increase in gas purchase and other energy costs in the texas and missouri service territories in as compared to as well as the acquisition of the new england operations 
the remaining increase in operating revenues  gas purchase and other energy costs  and gas sales volume resulted principally from the colder than normal weather in the texas and missouri service territories in as compared to the unusually mild temperatures in gas transportation volumes in increased  mmcf to  mmcf at an average transportation rate per mcf of 
compared with 
in the new england gas company contributed an increase of  mmcf  while pg energy experienced a net increase of  mmcf in operating margin operating margin in operating revenues less gas purchase and other energy costs and revenue related taxes decreased by  compared with an increase of  in operating margins and earnings are primarily dependent upon gas sales volumes and gas service rates 
the level of gas sales volumes is sensitive to the variability of the weather as well as the timing of acquisitions and divestitures 
sales volumes  which benefited from colder than normal weather in  were negatively impacted by unusually mild temperatures throughout fiscal year as well as in if normal weather had been present throughout the company s service territories in and  operating margin would have increased by approximately  and  respectively 
texas  missouri  pennsylvania and new england accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s operating margin in and   and  respectively  in weather weather in the missouri gas energy service territories in was of a year measure  warmer than in weather in the southern union gas service territories in was of a year measure  warmer than in about half of the customers served by southern union gas are weather normalized

these customer totals exclude southern union s equity ownership in a natural gas distribution company in piedras negras  mexico that currently serves  customers 
changes in customer totals between years primarily reflect the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
southern union gas served  customers in texas during missouri gas energy served  customers in central and western missouri 
pg energy served  customers in northeastern and central pennsylvania  and new england gas company served  customers in rhode island and massachusetts during supro energy company supro  a propane subsidiary of the company  served  customers in texas 
south florida natural gas and atlantic gas corporation  a propane subsidiary of the company  served  and customers  respectively  until their sale in december in rhode island and massachusetts  valley propane  which was sold in september  served  propane customers while provenergy fuels  inc  served  fuel oil customers until its sale in august energy services served  propane customers until april  when the propane operations were sold

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
the company believes the following are the most significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financials statements 
accounting for rate regulation the fasb standard  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service 
the company s gas utility operations adhere to the accounting and reporting requirements of this statement 
certain expenses and revenues dependent on utility regulation or rate determination that would customarily be reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and recognized in income as the applicable amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
the aggregate amount of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are million and million at june   and million and million at june   respectively 
impairment of long lived assets and assets held for sale long lived assets  which principally include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and equity investments comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates about the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation methods and useful lives 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of these assets for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about future demand  future market conditions and regulatory developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
during june  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows attributable to the company s reporting units that have goodwill  as compared to the carrying value of those reporting units net assets 
as of june   pursuant to the fasb standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  no impairment had been indicated 
in connection with the company s cash flow improvement plan announced in july  the company began the divestiture of certain non core assets 
as a result of prices of comparable businesses for various non core properties and pursuant to the fasb standard  impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september   and an asset impairment loss of  was recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended june  accounting for investments in equity securities the company holds securities of capstone turbine corporation capstone  which are classified as available for sale under the fasb standard accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these securities are stated at fair value  based on quoted market price  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in a separate component of common stockholders equity 
all other securities owned by the company are accounted for under the cost method 
the company s other investments in securities consist of common and preferred stock in non public companies whose value is not readily determinable 
the company reviews its portfolio of other investment securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors that are considered in assessing whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  but are not limited to earnings trends and asset quality  near term prospects and financial condition of the issuer  financial condition and prospects of the issuer s region and industry  and southern union s intent and ability to retain the investment 
if the company determines that the decline in value of an investment security is other than temporary  the company will record a charge on its consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value 
in june  southern union determined that the decline in value of its investment in pointserve was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to reduce the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value 
the company recognized this valuation adjustment to reflect significant lower private equity valuation metrics and changes in the business outlook of pointserve 
pointserve is a closely held  privately owned company and  as such  has no published market value 
the company s remaining investment of  at june  may be subject to future market value risk 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its investment and periodically assess the impact  if any  on reported earnings in future periods 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company accounts for pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with the fasb standards employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these statements require liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of these future obligations to employees net of any plan assets 
the calculation of these liabilities and associated expenses require the expertise of actuaries and are subject to many assumptions including life expectancies  present value discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs 
any change in these assumptions can significantly change the liability and associated expenses recognized in any given year 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement legal obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and when the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
when the liability is initially recorded  associated costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the statement requires entities to record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of adoption 
the company intends to adopt this statement during the quarter ended september  based on analysis completed to date  the company does not expect the statement will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company anticipates completing its analysis by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year in certain rate jurisdictions  the company is permitted to include annual charges for cost of removal in its regulated cost of service rates charged to customers 
in august  the fasb issued accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the statement replaces the fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting principles board opinion  reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
under the statement  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations prospectively 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption encouraged 
the statement is not expected to materially change the methods the company uses to measure impairment losses on long lived assets  but may result in additional future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations than was previously permitted 
the company intends to adopt the statement during the quarter ended september  in june  the fasb issued accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies the emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the statement is not expected to materially change the methods the company uses to measure exit or disposal costs  but may result in liabilities for such costs relating to future dispositions being reported in periods subsequent to the company s commitment to an exit plan
