background organization through a series of mergers and acquisitions  we have grown substantially since our inception in patriot american hospitality  inc  or patriot  was formed on april  as a self administered real estate investment trust  or reit  to acquire equity interests in hotel properties 
on october   patriot completed an initial public offering of its common stock and commenced its operations 
between october  and july   patriot acquired interests in hotel properties and leased them to various third party lessees 
on july   patriot merged into california jockey club  or cal jockey  which we will refer to as the cal jockey merger in this form k 
as part of this merger  cal jockey and bay meadows operating company  or bay meadows  entered into a paired share arrangement under which both of their common stocks were paired and traded together 
also  cal jockey changed its name to patriot  and bay meadows changed its name to patriot american hospitality operating company 
in january  wyndham hotel corporation merged into patriot and  as part of that merger  patriot american hospitality operating company changed its name to wyndham international  inc we will refer to wyndham international  inc 
as it existed before june  as old wyndham 
during  patriot and old wyndham grew primarily by acquiring hotels and other related businesses using proceeds of over billion 
they financed these acquisitions with funds drawn on their revolving credit facilities and capital raised by issuing paired shares and by having their two operating partnerships issue limited partnership interests 
these acquisitions included 
the acquisition of wyndham hotel corporation in january referred to above  as a result of which patriot acquired wyndham hotels  clubhouse hotels  management and franchise contracts  the wyndham and clubhouse proprietary brand names  and the wyndham hotel management company  
three resort hotels in puerto rico and a majority interest in a related hotel company  
arcadian international limited  which owned hotels in england  one hotel in jersey  five owned and managed malmaison hotels  two european resorts under development  the malmaison proprietary brand name  and a interest in a property being developed in london

the hospitality related business of chc international  inc  or chci  which included the acquisition of leases and of the related management contracts related to patriot hotels  eight third party management contracts  two third party asset management contracts  the grand bay proprietary brand name  and certain other assets 
on june   we restructured our organization 
as part of this restructuring 
patriot became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  
we and patriot terminated the paired share arrangement  
each outstanding paired share was converted into one share of our class a common stock  and 
patriot terminated its status as a reit effective january  and became a taxable corporation as of that date 
also on june   we completed a billion series b preferred stock equity investment and closed a new credit facility comprised of a senior credit facility and an increasing rate loan facility  which was amended and restated as of january   and closed on additional mortgage debt 
holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to a quarterly dividend on a cumulative basis at a rate of per year  and our series b preferred stock is convertible  at the holders option  into shares of our class b common stock 
also in  we completed an offering of our series a preferred stock  which  except for voting rights  has substantially similar terms to our series b preferred stock 
we used the proceeds of our series a preferred stock offering to redeem some of our series b preferred stock 
under the terms of our preferred stock  if cash dividends are in arrears and unpaid for a period of days or more  then an additional amount of dividends accrue at a rate per annum of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until all cash dividends in arrears have been paid in full 
such additional dividends are cumulative and payable in additional shares of preferred stock 
as of december   we had accrued million at a rate of per annum as an additional dividend because cash dividends totaling million on the preferred stock had been in arrears and unpaid for a period of more than days 
in addition  in our amended and restated credit facilities  we agreed not to pay the cash portion of the regular quarterly dividend on our preferred stock 
also during  we sold a racecourse  land adjacent to the racecourse  and hotels for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we also distributed approximately of the shares of interstate in the form of a dividend to our stockholders  which we will refer to as the interstate spin off 
during  we agreed to the redemption of our aggregate non voting economic interest in interstate hotels  llc  a principal operating subsidiary of interstate 
interstate hotels  llc transferred to us a management agreement for one hotel owned by us and amended management agreements with respect to six other hotels owned by us to reduce the management fees and to permit termination by the owner upon days notice 
in addition  approximately of our interest was redeemed by interstate hotels  llc and substantially all of the remainder was converted into a preferred membership interest in interstate hotels  llc 
as additional consideration for the redemption and conversion of our interest  we caused our representative on interstate s board of directors to resign and relinquished our right to appoint a member to interstate s board of directors in the future 
in addition  we granted interstate an option exercisable within days of october   to acquire all of interstate s stock owned by us at a weighted average trading price per share  provided that the purchase price not be less than per share nor more than per share 
on december   the common stock was acquired for approximately  on july   interstate hotels  llc  pursuant to a redemption agreement  called for the redemption of our preferred interest in interstate hotels  llc 
in consideration for the redemption  we received million in cash and two promissory notes in the amounts of  and million  respectively 
the notes bear interest at and mature on july  and july   respectively 
we recorded a gain of million  net of previously recorded impairment of million 
the portion of our interest that was not converted into a preferred membership interest will remain outstanding 
thereafter  at any time on or after july   both we and interstate hotels  llc have the right to require interstate hotels  llc to redeem the remaining common interest at an amount that is the lesser of a the product of i five times interstate hotels  llc s ebitda as of december  and ii the percentage of total equity interest in interstate hotels  llc which is represented by the remaining interest  or b approximately  in  we sold the following assets 
the sierra suites r hotel brand  one owned and three leased properties  franchise and management contracts for sierra suites r  and nine management contracts for summerfield suites r for net cash proceeds of approximately million  million of which was used to relieve future payment obligations related to the sf hotel company  lp acquisitions in discussed above  
hotels two of which were leased back to us and the clubhouse inn proprietary brand for net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of mortgage debt  and 
investments in three hotels  two parcels of land  retail space  and a garage for net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt and a note receivable of million 
in  we sold the following assets 
two hotels and a sewer company  in separate transactions for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt  
one hotel in which we retained a preferred equity interest for net cash proceeds of approximately million  
three hotels and investments in four additional hotels in a single transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately million  and 
six hotels  which were exchanged for one hotel 
at december   we had approximately billion of assets classified as held for sale  net of impairment 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
based on the estimated sale proceeds  we recorded a provision for loss on assets held for sale of million in operating expenses for the year ended december  at december   we also recorded an impairment of million in operating expenses on real estate assets held for use where current facts  circumstances and analysis indicate that the assets might be impaired 
due to the tragic events of september   we reclassified certain assets previously categorized as held for sale to held for use 
this reclassification resulted from delays in our anticipated disposition of these assets beyond one year 
an impairment charge was also necessary with respect to these assets due to market changes that could impact the prices received for these assets 
consequently  we recorded an impairment of million for assets held for sale at december   and a provision of million on real estate assets held for use at december  we anticipated that as a result of the effects on our business of the events of september   we would likely not be able to comply with certain of the financial ratio covenants in our credit agreement and increasing rate loan agreement 
accordingly  shortly after the events of september   the lenders under the bank credit facilities granted us a waiver of certain financial covenants through february  in an agreement dated as of january   we amended and restated our bank credit facilities 
under the terms of the amendment and restatement  all financial covenants  other than the interest coverage ratio test  have been eliminated 
the minimum interest coverage ratio has been reduced from to until december   and to thereafter 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement  we provided additional collateral to the lenders  agreed to an increase in the interest rates payable under the term loans and revolving credit facility  and agreed to limit our capital expenditures to million per year  plus million per year for emergency capital expenditures 
we also agreed that we would use of the net cash proceeds from sales of the lenders collateral  of the proceeds from other asset sales and proceeds from mortgage refinancings and of the proceeds from new debt issuances to reduce debt outstanding under the bank credit facilities 
we also agreed not to pay the cash portion of the regular quarterly dividend on our series a and series b convertible preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  impairment of assets  assets held for sale  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets  including intangible assets  to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
our management uses judgment in projecting which assets will be sold by us within the next twelve months 
these judgments are based on our management s knowledge of the current market and the status of current negotiations with third parties 
if assets are expected to be sold within months  they are reclassified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we are a defendant in lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
our management uses its judgment  with the aid of legal counsel  to determine if accruals are necessary as a result of any pending actions against us 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our hotel revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately  of the decrease in our hotel revenues is attributable to those hotels that have been sold since the remaining decrease is attributable to declining revenues throughout our owned and leased hotel portfolio 
revpar decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in our hotel expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as with revenues  our hotel expenses were impacted by the hotel sales discussed above 
approximately  of the decrease in our hotel expenses can be attributed to hotels that have been sold since the remaining decrease is attributable to staffing reductions at the hotels and other cost saving initiatives we implemented as our hotel revenues declined 
our management fee and service fee income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of reductions in hotel revenue upon which the fees are based and the sale and termination of certain contracts since december  our interest and other income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recognized a termination fee of  resulting from the termination of a portfolio of management contracts and  from the termination of another contract 
our general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses in were impacted by increases in conversion costs of  resulting from our implementation of brand standards  the write off of  for receivables deemed not collectible and  in reservation and marketing funds not reimbursed by hotels 
this increase was offset in part by a reduction in legal costs  training costs and the size of our corporate staff during our interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in interest rates 
at december  and  we had approximately billion of debt 
the average one month libor rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this reduction of interest rates was partially offset by derivatives we put in place that fixed the interest rate on a portion of our debt 
our depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we identified certain assets held for sale 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 once we identify an asset for sale  depreciation is no longer recorded 
thus  depreciation for the year ended december  was reduced 
in addition  in december  certain intangible assets were written off thus reducing amortization expense for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we classified five assets as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
based on the estimated net sales proceeds  we recorded a reserve for impairment for loss on real estate assets held for sale of  the provision reduces the carrying value of the five owned hotels to the estimated net sales proceeds less estimated costs to sell 
due to the events of september   which delayed certain sales transactions  other than the five assets  all remaining assets classified as held for sale as of december  have been reclassified as held for use as of december  in addition  we recorded a reserve for impairment on three assets held for use of  the benefit for income taxes was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the tax benefit is in part due to increased operating profitability and in part to the classification of certain assets as held for sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  resulting in differences in gaap and tax depreciation 
minority interests share of income in consolidated subsidiaries was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allocation of income is due to the increased profitability of certain partnerships  which resulted from the fact that no depreciation expense was recorded because assets in these partnerships were held for sale 
the increase was partially offset by the sale of one of those partnership interests in june the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  on january  resulted in the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and a charge of  in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of  for the change in the fair value through earnings  and a charge of  through other comprehensive income 
also  during  we paid  in settlement payments for the ineffective hedges 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of  net of taxes  as an extraordinary item resulting from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs for debt that has been repaid 
our resulting net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we will take a charge of  for the writeoff of goodwill in the first quarter of  which is expected to materially adversely affect our net operating results for see newly issued accounting standards below 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our hotel revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although our hotel revenues remained relatively stable between periods  increases during the year ended december  from acquisitions  assets placed in service  and increases in revpar throughout our portfolio of properties were offset by the assets sales during and the interstate spin off on june  our hotel expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as with our revenues  our expenses remained relatively stable between periods 
the decrease in our expenses resulting from assets sales was partially offset by increases in our expenses resulting from acquisitions and new assets placed in service during the previous year 
our management fee and service fee income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily the result of the loss of management contracts associated with the interstate spin off  the sale of the third party management contracts in the sierra transaction in the first quarter of  and the loss of a portfolio of management contracts during our interest and other income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to our recognition of a termination fee of  related to the termination of management contracts in and interest income from funds held in escrow for all of in  certain of the funds were escrowed for only six months because the debt was not obtained until june our general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily a result of expenditures incurred in  in part associated with our june  restructuring  but not incurred in those costs included 
 of strategic reorganization costs  including fees to settle forward equity contracts and vesting of employees stock awards  
 associated with the write off of bond offering costs  
 of costs associated with the interstate spin off  
 of abandoned transaction costs  
 of costs associated with conversion costs and becoming year compliant  and 
 associated with the write off of receivables from a managed hotel in which we terminated the management contract 
in addition  in we incurred approximately  of general and administrative expenses for divisional offices located in pittsburgh  wichita  and phoenix 
we incurred minimal costs during because those offices were closed during and the first quarter of however  in  we incurred approximately  in severance related expenses for certain executive officers who resigned in in addition  during  we incurred approximately  in costs associated with the settlement of certain lawsuits and legal fees related to those lawsuits 
also in  we recorded  of costs associated with our june  restructuring 
these costs primarily relate to the non cash write down of assets of approximately  as we exited from certain business sectors  and focused on our core brands and products 
in our attempt to streamline our organization  we closed offices in new york  london  phoenix  and wichita 
we recorded costs of  as a result of severance  lease cancellation costs  legal costs and other costs related to this exit 
our interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in our interest expense is primarily related to higher interest rate spreads on our current credit facilities as compared to the old credit facility and higher interest rates during as compared to our derivative financial instruments in part negated the impact of these higher rates 
however  we also had increases in the amortization of loan costs associated with the amortization of the premiums for billion in new derivatives acquired in march during the year ended december   we recognized losses on the sale of assets of  during the year ended december   we recognized losses of  on the sale of assets 
at december   we had classified assets as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
based on the estimated net sales proceeds  we recorded a reserve for impairment for loss on real estate assets held for sale of  in addition  we recorded a write down for impairment of  on assets held for use   on management contract costs  and a reserve for impairment of  on investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries that were held for sale 
our depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in capital renovations during  as well as the placement in service of additional assets that were previously under development  offset in part by the asset sales that occurred during  and the placement of certain assets held for sale 
our share of equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due primarily from the allocation of income from one of its investments  which was in development in but in operation in in addition  the amount was impacted by loss allocations from one subsidiary  which resulted in the write down of certain leaseholds 
the benefit provision for income taxes was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in the provision is due to a charge of  as a result of patriot s conversion from a reit to a c corporation  the restructuring of certain special purpose controlled subsidiaries  which previously could not be consolidated with our taxable income or loss  and charges taken in for the impairment of certain assets held for sale 
minority interest s share of loss associated with the operating partnerships was  for the year ended december  there was no minority interest s share of the income loss associated with the operating partnerships for the year ended december  due to amendments in the partnership agreements at june  that changed the allocation of profit and loss to the limited partners 
in connection with our debt financing on june   we wrote off the remaining balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the old credit facility resulting in an extraordinary loss of  net of minority interest and income taxes  in as a result  our net loss was million and billion for years ended december  and  respectively

credit facilities as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  billion outstanding on term loans  and million outstanding under increasing rate loans 
additionally  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
also  as of december   we had over billion of mortgage debt outstanding that encumbered hotels and capital leases and other debt of million  resulting in total indebtedness of approximately billion 
this billion in total indebtedness includes approximately million of debt associated with assets held for sale 
as of december   after giving effect to the amendments to our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility  we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
we anticipated that we would not be in compliance at september  with certain financial ratio covenants in our senior credit facility and our increasing rate loans facility due to the tragic events of september  accordingly  on september   we and our lenders entered into a waiver of the financial covenants for the third and fourth quarters of the waiver was effective through february  as a condition of the waiver  we agreed to certain additional restrictions during the time period that the waiver was in effect  including requirements that a availability under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility would not be less than million  b all of the net proceeds received from sales of our assets would be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under these loan facilities  with proceeds being applied to repay increasing rate loans  to repay term loans  and to repay the revolving loans  c certain of our capital expenditures would be limited and our capital expenditures and investments could not exceed million  and d cash dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock could be paid only if concurrently with the payment of these dividends the cash would be loaned back to us on a subordinated basis 
on january   we successfully reached an agreement with the lenders under our senior credit facility and our increasing rate loans facility to permanently amend these facilities 
the key terms of the amendments are as follows 
the total leverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio requirements have been eliminated from the facilities  
the interest coverage ratio decreased from to to to until december   at which time it will increase to to  
we granted mortgages on of our properties that were not previously encumbered  
the interest rate on our term loans increased to libor plus per annum  
the interest rate on our revolving credit facility increased to libor plus per annum  
of the net cash proceeds from sales of the lenders collateral  and of the net cash proceeds we receive from other asset sales and any excess proceeds we receive from any mortgage debt refinancing must be used to reduce the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility and the increasing rate loans facility  
of the net cash proceeds we receive from any new debt issuance must be used to reduce the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility and the increasing rate loans facility  
our capital and development spending cannot exceed million per annum  with million available for use in certain emergencies  and 
we cannot pay the cash portion of the regular quarterly dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock 
we have considered our short term liquidity needs and the adequacy of adjusted estimated cash flows and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe that our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund our normal recurring expenses and our debt service requirements 
we anticipate that these needs will be fully funded from our cash flows provided by operating activities and  when necessary  from our revolving credit facility 
in the past  we have generally met our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of activities  such as development and scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the proceeds from the sale of our assets 
under the terms of the applicable credit facility  loan agreement  and lease agreement  as of december   our principal amortization and balloon payment requirements and our future five year minimum lease payments are summarized as follows payments due by year and total thereafter in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations        office leases        hotel and ground leases        total        during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
of that amount  as of march  we have extended million to or beyond 
we are seeking to refinance the remaining mortgages prior to their maturities in  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
of that amount  the company can elect to extend million for two additional twelve month periods 
we believe that both we and the lodging industry will continue to be adversely affected by the september  terrorist attacks and their aftermath 
immediately following the attacks  our hotels experienced significant short term declines in occupancy compared to the prior year 
although occupancies have improved from these very depressed levels  at present  it is not possible to predict the duration of such declines in the medium or long term 
we are currently unable to estimate the medium or long term negative impact that the september  terrorist attacks and their aftermath could have on operations  liquidity  and capital resources see risks related to our indebtedness on page 
dividends we do not anticipate paying a dividend to our common shareholders and we are prohibited under the terms of our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying dividends on our class a common stock 
for the six year period beginning september   dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock are payable partly in cash and partly in additional shares of our series a and series b preferred stock  with the cash portion aggregating million per year  so long as there is no redemption or conversion of our series a and series b preferred stock 
for the following four years  dividends are payable in cash or additional shares of our series a or series b preferred stock  as the case may be  as determined by our board of directors 
after year ten  dividends are payable solely in cash 
we anticipated that we would not be in compliance at september  with certain financial ratio covenants in our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility due to the tragic events of september  accordingly  on september   we and our leaders entered into a waiver of the financial covenants for the third and fourth quarters of the waiver is effective through february  as a condition of the waiver  we agreed to certain additional restrictions during the time period the waiver is in effect  including requirements that cash dividends on our series a and b preferred stock could be paid only if concurrently with the payment of these dividends  the cash would be loaned back to us on a subordinated basis 
thus  since july   we have not paid the cash portion of the regular quarterly dividends on our series a and b preferred stock 
we are prohibited under the terms of our recent waiver and amendments to the senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying cash dividends on our preferred stock 
as of december   we had deferred payments of the cash portion of the preferred stock dividend totaling approximately million 
this amount has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of december  in addition  according to the terms of our series a and b preferred stock  if the cash dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for at least days  then an additional amount of dividends will accrue at an annual rate of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until the cash dividends in arrears have been paid in full 
these additional dividends are cumulative and payable in additional shares of preferred stock 
as a result  an additional dividend of million  payable in preferred shares  has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of december  renovations and capital improvements during  we invested approximately million in capital improvements and renovations 
these capital expenditures included i costs related to converting hotels to one of our proprietary brands  ii costs related to enhancing the revenue producing capabilities of our hotels  and iii costs related to recurring capital maintenance reserves and technological initiatives 
during  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures primarily for costs related to recurring maintenance capital expenditures and technological initiatives 
we attempt to schedule renovations and improvements during traditionally lower occupancy periods in an effort to minimize disrupting our hotels operations 
therefore  we do not believe such renovations and capital improvements will have a material effect on the results of operations of our hotels 
we will finance capital expenditures through capital expenditure reserves or with working capital 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit our availability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature  however  the periods during which our hotel properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property and depend predominantly on the property s location 
our revenues typically have been higher in the first and second quarters than in the third or fourth quarters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  impairment of assets  assets held for sale  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets  including intangible assets  to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
our management uses judgment in projecting which assets will be sold by us within this next twelve months 
these judgments are based on our management s knowledge of the current market and the status of current negotiations with third parties 
if assets are expected to be sold within months  they are reclassified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we are a defendant in lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
our management uses its judgment  with the aid of legal counsel  to determine if accruals are necessary as a result of any pending actions against us 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 which we are required to adopt effective january  this statement also requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at fair value 
sfas  as amended  requires that derivatives that are not hedges be recorded at fair value through earnings 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective 
this statement also allows special hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
the gain or loss on a fair value hedging instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk be recognized currently in earnings in the same accounting period 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized currently through earnings regardless of whether the instrument is designated as a hedge 
by adopting this statement on january   we recognized in the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million in our consolidated statement of operations and a charge of million in our other comprehensive income in the first quarter of in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
statement supersedes apb no 
 business combination 
the provisions of statement  require that we use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
statement also requires that upon adoption of statement  the company reclassify carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
statement supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of statement  prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the provisions of the standards also apply to equity method investments made both before and after june  statement requires that the unamortized deferred credit related to an excess over cost arising from an investment that was accounted for using the equity method equity method negative goodwill  and that was acquired before july   must be written off immediately and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
equity method negative goodwill arising from equity investments made after june  must be written off immediately and recorded as an extraordinary gain  instead of being deferred and amortized 
statement prohibits amortization of the excess of cost over the underlying equity in the net assets of an equity method investee that is recognized as goodwill 
we will adopt the provisions of statement in the first quarter of we are in the process of preparing for its adoption of statement and are making the determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
in connection with the adoption of statement  we expect that we will no longer annually record million of amortization relating to our existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  as adjusted for the reclassifications just mentioned 
statement requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
we expect to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of our fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of statement will be completed during the first quarter of any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter we are currently evaluating the potential impairment loss  but anticipate our goodwill will be impaired with a charge of million in the first quarter of in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement no 
requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if we can make a reasonable estimate of fair value 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
statement no 
will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we will recognize the cumulative effect of adoption of statement no 
as a change in accounting principle 
we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
statement no 
supercedes statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
primarily addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of statement no 
and develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of statement no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks our primary market risk exposure is to future changes in interest rates related to our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  including debt obligations  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and future debt commitments 
we manage our debt portfolio by periodically entering into interest rate swaps and caps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates or to limit our exposure to rising interest rates 
the following table provides information about our derivative and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
