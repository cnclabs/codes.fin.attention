all other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
during fiscal  we adopted aicpa sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  and began expensing restaurant preopening costs as incurred 
previously  such costs were deferred and amortized over the month period following restaurant openings 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of march   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated two upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark in los angeles  california and las vegas  nevada  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed three limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold to our guests 
revenue from bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors is recognized when the products are shipped 
sales and cost of sales are reported separately for restaurant and bakery activities 
all other operating cost and expense categories are reported on a combined basis for both restaurant and bakery activities 
comparable restaurant sales include the sales from restaurants open for the full period of each period being compared 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal and each consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on december  on september   disney regional entertainment disney closed its disneyquest family entertainment facility in chicago  illinois 
accordingly  our limited menu express foodservice operation located inside that disneyquest facility also closed on that date 
due to the small size and limited scope of this operation and the terms of our agreement with disney  this closure did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
disney expects to continue to operate the one remaining disneyquest facility in orlando  florida and we expect to continue to operate our limited menu express foodservice operation inside that facility 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations of the company expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year revenues restaurant sales bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors total revenues costs and expenses restaurant cost of sales bakery cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks revenues total revenues increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks of fiscal after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  total revenues for fiscal would have increased by approximately 
restaurant sales increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks in the prior fiscal year 
restaurant sales would have increased by for fiscal after adjusting for approximately million of sales for the extra week in fiscal the resulting restaurant sales increase of million for fiscal on a week basis consisted of the following components million from the openings of nine new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened during fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks and estimated productive square feet increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal on a week basis 
a single restaurant open during the full period of fiscal would have generated operating weeks 
productive square feet consists of interior plus seasonally adjusted patio square feet 
we believe that measuring the changes in total restaurant operating weeks and total productive square feet from period to period is the most effective way to analyze the growth of the total productive capacity of our restaurant operations 
average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year increased to  compared to  for fiscal on a week basis 
to conform with the more prevalent practice of measuring comparable sales changes in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry  starting in fiscal we will measure comparable sales using restaurants open more than eighteen months 
in fiscal and prior years  we measured comparable sales using restaurants open more than twelve months 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal under both measures 
this increase was partially attributable to effective menu price increases totaling approximately for the full fiscal year  offset in part by reduced guest traffic in several of our higher profile restaurants after the events of september  excluding factors outside of our control  we only expect to achieve increases in comparable restaurant sales that are approximately equal to our effective menu price increases  since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during peak meal periods 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million for the weeks in fiscal compared to million for the weeks in the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  bakery sales would have increased approximately during fiscal the increase in bakery sales was principally attributable to higher sales volumes to new and established foodservice accounts and to warehouse club operators 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs remained relatively constant at during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
approximately one third of our restaurant cost of sales consists of fresh produce  poultry and dairy commodities that can be subject to supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales  which include ingredient  packaging and production supply costs  were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a shift in the mix of sales to products with slightly higher cost of sales as a percentage of their associated price but with slightly lower selling expenses  which are included in the other operating costs and expenses category and a slight increase in the cost for certain dairy related commodities that are not subject to annual fixed price contracts 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our bakery or restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions beyond our control 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement for as much as million pounds during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to execute agreements for substantially all of our cream cheese requirements for the month period thereafter with two or more suppliers at a fixed cost per pound that is expected to be slightly higher than the cost experienced for fiscal we may also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting increased costs for employee health insurance benefits  partially offset by labor productivity improvements 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
the state of california increased its minimum wage by per hour to effective january  this was on top of a similar increase per hour that was effective january  that did not have a material impact on our labor expenses as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal as of march   of our restaurant locations were in california 
we believe the latest california minimum wage increase should not have a material impact on our labor expenses as a percentage of our total revenues 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses and taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased slightly to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher costs for electric and natural gas services which increased to of restaurant revenues for fiscal compared to for fiscal and increased costs for our insurance arrangements  which reflected the general increase in such costs resulting from the terrorist attacks of september  we expect the costs for all of our insurance arrangements to continue to increase during fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of these supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year as the increase in these expenses for fiscal was less than the increase in total revenues for the year 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the g a activities of our business  commensurate with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened nine restaurants during fiscal compared to seven openings during fiscal preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening cost for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  and costs for practice service activities 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be caused by landlords 
our direct preopening cost for a  square foot  single story restaurant in an established company market averages approximately  to  preopening costs will usually be higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for new concepts such as grand lux cafe 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs for a typical restaurant opening within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of the restaurant s opening 
preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant  and the fluctuations could be significant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal and  preopening costs for each of those years will likely exceed the respective amount of preopening costs for the applicable prior year 
interest income  other expense income and income taxes interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments that was due to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal other income for fiscal was million compared to other expense of million for fiscal this increase was principally due to gains recognized in fiscal on the sale of short term investments compared to a one time write off of the remaining net book value of our former restaurant point of sale pos system in the prior fiscal year 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  we initially estimate our effective tax rate to be in the range of 
the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pretax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks revenues total revenues increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks of fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks of the prior fiscal year 
the restaurant sales increase of million was due to million from the additional operating week in fiscal representing revenues from the final week of the th quarter which included higher sales from the new year s holiday  million from the openings of seven new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened during fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from increased comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks and estimated productive square feet increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal on a week basis 
average sales per restaurant operating week increased to  compared to  for fiscal comparable sales for restaurants open at least twelve months increased during fiscal for restaurants open at least eighteen months and benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately for the fiscal year 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased slightly to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally as a result of menu price increases and higher volume purchase discounts 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales decreased slightly for fiscal to compared to for fiscal  principally as a result of lower dairy related commodity costs principally cream cheese  whipped cream and butter 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal versus for fiscal  principally due to the leveraging of the fixed component of this expense category with higher revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our field supervision and corporate support organizations  commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were for both fiscal and preopening costs preopening costs decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened seven restaurants during fiscal compared to eight openings during fiscal interest income interest income increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher levels of interest bearing cash and investments during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year adjusted net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year adjusted current ratio  end of year long term debt  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures fiscal consisted of weeks 
all other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
includes all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of january  this increase was principally due to increased cash flow from operations 
in the table above  we also present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations more properly reflect our overall liquidity position 
in response to the recent decrease in the general level of interest rates and our forecasted cash flow requirements  we have been slightly lengthening the average maturity of our marketable securities portfolio in order to capture additional investment yield 
as a result  most of our investments in marketable securities now have maturities in excess of one year and are classified as noncurrent assets  but remain available for our liquidity requirements 
as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
the credit facility expires on may  on that date  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility may also be used for standby letters of credit to support our purchasing and insurance programs 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of our operations  with which we are currently in compliance 
our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a mall retailer  since most of our restaurants occupy leased spaces in shopping malls  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers or other real estate developments 
we expend cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that will be reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we initially record uncollected landlord construction contributions as other receivables 
our balance of other receivables will fluctuate from period to period  depending on the timing of cash collections from landlords and additional receivables recorded from new restaurant development activities 
see note  other receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
in the future  we may also develop more freestanding restaurant locations using both ground leases and built to suit leases  which are commonly used to finance freestanding locations in the restaurant industry 
we own substantially all of the equipment in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our cash outlays and accrued liability for capital expenditures were approximately million 
of that amount  approximately million was related to new restaurant openings including several restaurants under construction as of fiscal year end 
the remainder consisted of approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures for our existing restaurants  approximately million for restaurant level technology upgrades and approximately million for bakery and corporate capital expenditures 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our total capital expenditures to range between million  net of agreed upon landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this estimate contemplates million for as many as new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  which includes an estimated increase in construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and which also reflects the fact that two of our planned restaurant openings for fiscal do not have any landlord construction contributions 
not every potential location that we seek to develop into a restaurant may have landlord construction contributions available  and we would therefore not expect to incur a contingent rent obligation on such locations 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants  million to build out the new leased space for additional training  r d and office space adjacent to our existing corporate facility that is scheduled to commence during the second half of fiscal  and million to add capacity to our existing bakery production facility 
based on current business conditions and our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  coupled with expected cash provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
during fiscal  our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options under our current stock option plans 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of million through january  as of march   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
our operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was effective in july and sfas no 
became effective in january the new standards did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement  which establishes one accounting model for the recognition  measurement and reporting of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  became effective january with early application encouraged 
we adopted this standard during fiscal and it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for substantially all of our fresh commodities such as produce  poultry  meat  fish and dairy items for long periods of time and  consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which increased in   and proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
the state of california increased its minimum wage by per hour to in january  and by another per hour to in january additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while the company has been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for its menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
over one half of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available seating for all restaurants open as of march  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal   or fiscal through march  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of january   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flow from operations and would not have an impact on net income until the securities were disposed of
