item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since the company s inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of antibody based cancer therapeutics 
our proprietary  tumor activated prodrug  or tap  technology combines extremely potent  small molecule drugs with monoclonal antibodies that recognize and bind specifically to tumor cells 
our targeted delivery technology increases the potency of these cancer specific antibodies  which allow our drugs to kill cancer cells with minimal harm to healthy tissue 
the cytotoxic agent we currently use in all of our tap products is the maytansinoid dm  a chemical derivative of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that allow companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial products containing their antibodies 
we also use our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anti cancer products 
we licensed certain rights to our two most advanced  internally developed tap product candidates to companies that have product development and commercialization capabilities that we wished to access 
the terms of the collaborative agreements vary  reflecting the value we add to the development of any particular product candidate  however  the agreements generally provide that we receive upfront and milestone payments  royalties on sales of any resulting products and reimbursement of our fully burdened cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials 
under certain agreements  we receive our fully burdened cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials plus a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include glaxosmithkline plc  genentech  inc  abgenix  inc  british biotech plc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc and boehringer ingelheim international gmbh 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
in june  glaxosmithkline informed us that they have elected not to advance cantuzumab mertansine into phase ii clinical development under the present terms of our license agreement 
we intend to renegotiate with glaxosmithkline 
however  should we determine that it is not in the best interests of the company to enter into a revised agreement with glaxosmithkline  or we cannot reach satisfactory terms on a revised agreement  rights to cantuzumab mertansine will be returned to immunogen and we will be free to develop and or re license the product as we consider most appropriate 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses over the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
we do not anticipate that we will have a commercially approved product within the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly in the near term as we continue our development efforts 
moreover  in the next nine months we expect to pay out approximately million to further expand our development and pilot manufacturing facility in norwood  massachusetts 
on july   we signed a sublease on approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in a building located at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
we expect that we will spend in the range of million to million over the next to months to renovate this additional space 
on august   we announced that  effective immediately  our board of directors had authorized the open market repurchase of up to million shares of immunogen common stock 
the repurchases are to be made at the discretion of management and as market conditions warrant 
no time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program 
as of september   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million 
we anticipate that we will purchase additional shares of our common stock and that the total cost of the shares repurchased will be significant 
as our repurchases are at management s discretion and subject to market conditions  we are unable to estimate the total cost of the repurchase program or the period during which such repurchases may take place 
we anticipate that the increase in total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also allowing for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
critical accounting policies in december  the us securities and exchange commission the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  under the sarbanes oxley act  the company s independent auditors will be required to disclose in their reports to the audit committee the critical accounting policies used by immunogen 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition we currently have four types of out license and development contracts 
shared product license the company retains commercial rights worldwide excluding the european union and japan british biotech plc full product license glaxosmithkline plc license to a single target antigen single target license genentech  inc boehringer ingelheim international gmbh millennium pharmaceuticals  inc broad option agreements to acquire a specific number of licenses over a specified time period broad license genentech  inc abgenix  inc millennium pharmaceuticals  inc excluding the shared product license agreement  all of these collaboration agreements provide that we will i manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our collaborators  at their request and cost  ii receive payments upon our collaborators achievements of certain milestones and iii receive royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or years after product launch 
we are required to provide technical training and any process improvements and know how to our collaborators during the term of the collaboration agreements 
practically  once a collaborator receives us food and drug administration fda approval for any drug and the manufacturing process used to produce the drug  our collaborator will not be able to incorporate any process improvements or know how into their manufacturing process without additional testing and review by the fda 
accordingly  we believe that it is very unlikely that our collaborators will require our services subsequent to fda approval 
generally  upfront payments on product and single target licenses are deferred over the period of our substantial involvement 
we are available to assist our collaborators during the development of their products 
we estimate this development phase to begin at the inception of the contract and conclude when the product receives fda approval 
we believe this time period is  on average  six years 
at each reporting period we look at individual product facts and circumstances and review the estimated period of our substantial involvement 
significant changes in our estimates could result in changes to the deferral period 
in the event that the product or a single target license were terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
we defer upfront payments we receive from our broad option agreements over the period during which the collaborator may elect to receive a license 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement  but are between seven and years 
if a collaborator selects an option to acquire a license under these agreements  any option fee is deferred and recorded over the life of the option  generally to months 
if our collaborator exercises an option and we grant a single target license to the collaborator  we defer the license fee and account for it as we would an upfront payment on a single target collaboration agreement  as discussed above 
our shared product license collaboration provides for an upfront payment from our collaborator to us that was paid at the start of the agreement and  upon fda approval  we will pay the collaborator a milestone payment  which we expect will exceed the upfront payment we have received 
we have deferred the upfront payment and anticipate recognizing such revenue concurrent with the milestone payment that is required from us when and if the product receives fda approval 
in the event that the product does not receive fda approval  we will record as revenue the non refundable upfront payment we previously received upon the termination of the license agreement 
effective july   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under the new accounting method  adopted retroactively to july   we recognize revenue from non refundable  upfront license payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our period of involvement during development 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a non cash charge to income of million  which is included in our net loss for the year ended june  when milestone payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
in addition  when appropriate  we recognize revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
deferred revenue represents amounts received under collaborative agreements and not yet earned pursuant to these policies 
where we have no continuing involvement  we will record non refundable license fees as revenue upon receipt and will record milestone revenue upon achievement of the milestone by the collaborative partner 
inventory inventory costs primarily relate to clinical trial materials being manufactured for our collaborators 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate the estimated net realizable value of inventory at each reporting period 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to record inventory at its estimated net realizable value 
at june   inventory valuation allowances of  represent the cost of on hand conjugate produced for british biotech that we may not realize 
glaxosmithkline has initiated three phase i clinical trials of cantuzumab mertansine formerly called huc dm sb 
in the second phase i clinical trial glaxosmithkline reimbursed us the fully burdened cost to manufacture the clinical supply of cantuzumab mertansine 
in the third phase i clinical trial glaxosmithkline does not reimburse us for the cost of clinical material supply 
in the quarter ended march   the second and third phase i clinical trials were on going 
subsequent to the quarter end  glaxosmithkline determined that the second phase i clinical trial reached its primary endpoints 
because this trial achieved its objectives earlier than either party had originally anticipated  the study used less clinical material than projected 
as a result of the unexpected early conclusion of the second phase i trial  we concluded that we had more cantuzumab mertansine inventory on hand than glaxosmithkline would reimburse us for under our agreement with them 
as a result  in the quarter ended march   we established a valuation allowance to record the inventory at its estimated net realizable value 
in the quarter ended june   enrollment and dosing were completed in the second phase i clinical trial 
as the second phase i trial was complete  at june  we wrote down the cantuzumab mertansine inventory against the valuation allowance previously established 
the write down did not result in any additional charge or reversal of any portion of the previously established valuation allowance 
under the terms of our shared product license collaboration with british biotech  we are responsible for certain manufacturing and process development costs 
our actual cost to manufacture the hun antibody and conjugate exceeded our original estimates 
in the quarter ended march  we established a reserve of  to reduce the value of hun dm bb inventory to our estimate of the net realizable value at that date 
on may   we commenced negotiations with british biotech to determine the portion of the antibody and hun dm bb conjugate cost in excess of our original estimates for which british biotech would reimburse us 
in june  we agreed in principle that immunogen and british biotech would share in the costs of antibody in excess of our estimates and determined the amount we would be reimbursed for hun dm bb conjugate 
on august  immunogen and british biotech executed a supplemental letter agreement finalizing the oral agreement 
as of june  the reserve related to hun dm bb inventory was  which represents the cost of the on hand conjugate that british biotech will not reimburse 
results of operations revenues the following discussions relating to revenue for the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  reflect pro forma results as if we had adopted and followed sab from our inception 
our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to increased revenues associated with preclinical and clinical materials we manufacture and deliver to our collaborative partners offset by lower collaboration revenue 
the decrease in revenues from to is primarily attributable to lower collaboration revenue  as discussed in further detail below 
collaboration revenue for the year ended june  decreased to million compared to million in the same period in collaboration revenue for the year ended june  was million 
included in revenue in the year ended june  is a million milestone payment we received from glaxosmithkline upon the commencement of the phase i multidose clinical trial 
the revenue associated with this milestone was recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the period of our performance 
we substantially completed all of our performance during the year ended june  we did not earn any similar milestone payment during the year ended june  during the year ended june  we recognized collaboration revenue of  from glaxosmithkline   from genentech   from abgenix   from millennium  and  from boehringer ingelheim 
during the year ended june   we recognized collaboration revenue of million from glaxosmithkline   from genentech   from abgenix  and  from millennium 
during the year ended june   we recognized collaboration revenue of million of milestone payments from glaxosmithkline and  from genentech 
deferred revenue of million at june  represents progress payments received from our collaborators pursuant to contract revenues not yet earned 
clinical materials reimbursement increased to million in the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  we did not earn clinical materials reimbursement during the year ended june  we first shipped clinical materials  for which we were entitled to reimbursement  in the quarter ended march  clinical materials reimbursement for the year ended june  reflects twelve months of shipments compared to only five months of shipments in the year ended june  during the year ended june   we shipped clinical materials in support of the cantuzumab mertansine and hun dm bb clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp at our pilot plant  in support of certain other collaborators development efforts 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed is directly related to the number of on going clinical trials for which we are producing clinical material for our collaborators  the speed of enrollment in those trials and the dosage schedule of each clinical trial 
additionally  prior to clinical development  our collaborators may request that we produce clinical grade material  either in anticipation of clinical trials or for process development and analysis purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed may vary widely from quarter to quarter and annually 
development fees increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  development fees were  in the year ended june  development fees represent the fully burdened reimbursement of costs incurred in producing research grade materials in accordance with good laboratory practices and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
during the year ended june   we provided development services to more collaborators and potential collaborators than we had during the year ended june  or the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators products and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and annually 
research and development expenses we report research and development expense net of reimbursements we receive from our collaborators 
our net research and development expenses consist of i research to identify and evaluate new targets  antibodies and cytotoxic drugs  ii preclinical testing and clinical trials of our own  and in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and iii development related to improving clinical and commercial manufacturing processes 
our research efforts are primarily focused in the following areas our contributions to the clinical development of cantuzumab mertansine and hun dm bb  process improvements related to clinical and commercial production of the hun antibody  process improvements to our tap technology  preclinical development of our own potential products  process improvement related to the production of dm and strain development of its precursor  ansamitocin p  process development related to the commercial manufacture of the hun dm bb conjugate  operation  maintenance and expansion of our pilot scale manufacturing plant  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and in licensed antibodies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents 
glaxosmithkline is currently conducting one phase i clinical trial of cantuzumab mertansine 
the length of this trial is dependent upon the preliminary results of the trial  maximum tolerated dosage  and the number of patients dosed 
the actual length of this trial may vary from our estimates 
additionally  glaxosmithkline is the sponsor of this trial and  as such  has control over the clinical trial schedule and progress 
we are funding a portion of the cost of this on going phase i clinical trial 
in june  glaxosmithkline informed us that they have elected not to advance cantuzumab mertansine into phase ii clinical development under the present terms of our license agreement 
we intend to renegotiate with glaxosmithkline 
however  should we determine that it is not in the best interests of the company to enter into a revised agreement with glaxosmithkline  or we cannot reach satisfactory terms on a revised agreement  the rights to cantuzumab mertansine will be returned to immunogen and we will either develop and or re license the product as we consider most appropriate 
british biotech is currently conducting two phase i clinical trials of hun dm bb the first phase i study is being conducted at two clinical sites in the united states 
british biotech is also conducting a second phase i clinical trial of hun dm bb at two sites in the united kingdom 
we anticipate that both trials of hun dm bb will be completed in calendar year however  the actual length of the trials may vary from our estimates 
additionally  british biotech is the sponsor of both trials and  as such  has control over the clinical trial schedule and progress 
in addition to retaining worldwide commercial rights to hun dm bb excluding the european union and japan  we retain worldwide manufacturing rights 
under the terms of the contract  we are responsible for all clinical and commercial manufacturing process development 
we continue process development efforts to improve clinical hun antibody production 
under an arrangement with genzyme transgenics corporation  we are investigating the viability of commercial production of hun using transgenic goats 
we also continue to develop various other processes related to the commercial manufacture of the hun dm bb conjugate 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote significant financial and human resources to these efforts over the next five years 
our three internally developed  wholly owned product candidates that are most advanced at june  are humy dm  an anti igf r antibody and a third product 
humy dm is a humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated to dm and is directed against acute myeloid leukemia 
humy dm is in early preclinical development 
we intend to continue to conduct preclinical safety and efficacy studies on humy dm pending the successful preclinical development of humy dm and favorable outcome of preclinical safety and efficacy studies and any other studies  we expect to be prepared to file an investigational new drug application ind for humy dm in the next to months 
the actual filing of this ind is dependent upon the development of humy dm and the results of any and all preclinical studies and the financial and human resources that we are able to direct to the development of the product and completion of the ind application 
as a result  the timing of the filing of this ind  if it occurs at all  may vary from our estimates 
anti igf r antibody is a naked antibody directed against a target found on certain breast  lung and prostate cancers 
we are performing preclinical experiments to evaluate candidate antibodies and  pending the results of these studies  expect to move one antibody into preclinical development in calendar year our third  undisclosed  potential product is directed at a specific cancer and is in the early stages of preclinical development 
the cost to develop new products and advance those products to the ind stage can be significant 
worldwide antibody manufacturing capacity is currently constrained  and generally  manufacturing capacity must be reserved months in advance of production 
as such  we may out license any of our preclinical product candidates at any time 
if we develop any of these three products and test them in human clinical trials  we anticipate that we will incur substantial costs to reserve and manufacture humanized antibody 
further  if we develop these products internally  we would expect to devote substantial financial and human resources to these development efforts for the foreseeable future 
we review the results of all preclinical studies and tests to evaluate the viability of products under development 
we evaluate the value of each potential product at each stage of development to determine when  if ever  we should consider out licensing the product 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop our potential products as a result of the uncertainties related to preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of our product candidates will move into clinical development 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the medical indications  the timing  size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
in many cases  we are unable to determine what  if any  indication a particular product candidate will treat until we have completed extensive preclinical and animal studies 
given the uncertainties related to new drug development  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our potential product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
dm is the cytotoxic agent that we currently use in the manufacture of all of our collaborators and our own conjugates 
in order to make commercial manufacture of dm conjugates viable  we have devoted substantial resources to improve the strain of the microorganism that produces ansamitocin p  the precursor to dm  to enhance manufacturing yields 
we also continue to devote considerable resources to improve other dm manufacturing processes 
in connection with these efforts  we anticipate that we will incur research and development expense of million to million over the next twelve months 
we generally have not tracked our historical research and development costs by project  rather  we track such costs by department and expense category 
for this reason  we cannot accurately estimate with any degree of certainty what our historical costs have been for any particular research and development project 
we believe that our research and development costs by project would be confidential and the disclosure of such costs could have a material negative effect on our ability to negotiate with our suppliers  collaborators and potential collaborators and  accordingly  will not disclose our individual project research and development costs 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense for the year ended june  was million 
included in research and development expense for the year ended june  is a charge of million to record cantuzumab mertansine inventory at its estimated net realizable value 
during the year ended june   glaxosmithkline was conducting their second and third phase i clinical trials of cantuzumab mertansine 
glaxosmithkline reimbursed us the cost of clinical materials in the second trial 
this trial reached its primary endpoints and achieved its additional objectives earlier than anticipated 
the trial  therefore  used less clinical material than originally projected 
as a result of the early conclusion of the second trial  we had more cantuzumab mertansine inventory on hand than glaxosmithkline would reimburse 
as a result  in the quarter ending march   we wrote down the value of the inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the inventory valuation allowance was charged to research and development expense in the three month period ended march  in the quarter ended june   enrollment and dosing were completed in the second phase i clinical trial 
as the second phase i clinical trial was complete  at june   we wrote down the cantuzumab mertansine inventory against the valuation allowance previously established 
the write down did not result in any additional charge or reversal of any portion of the previously established valuation allowance 
in the other on going trial  we provide clinical material at our cost 
under the terms of our shared product license collaboration with british biotech  we are responsible for certain manufacturing and process development costs 
our actual cost to manufacture hun antibody exceeded our original estimates 
in the quarter ended march   we recorded a valuation allowance of  to reduce the amount of prepaid antibody to our estimate of its net realizable value 
in june  we agreed in principle that immunogen and british biotech would share in the costs of antibody in excess of our estimates 
based upon this oral agreement with british biotech  we determined that a valuation allowance of  was required to reduce the value of the prepaid material to our estimate of the realizable value at june  during the quarter ended june   approximately  of the previously established valuation allowance was reversed and recorded as a reduction in research and development expense to reflect an oral agreement between immunogen and british biotech 
on august   immunogen and british biotech executed a supplemental letter agreement finalizing this oral agreement 
in september  november  january  and march  we entered into process development collaborations with morphosys ag  genzyme transgenics corporation  avalon  inc and raven biotechnologies  inc  respectively 
these agreements relate to our internal research and development efforts and our collaboration with british biotech 
in september  we entered into an agreement with another party related to dm process development 
during the year ended june   we entered into several other agreements with other parties related to dm process development and production of antibody and dm included in the year ended june    and were million  million and  respectively  of expenses related to these agreements 
the number of research and development personnel increased to at june  compared to at june  research and development salaries and related expenses  including estimated fiscal bonuses that have been accrued have increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  we expect future research and development expenses to increase as we continue development of our product candidates and technologies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
as discussed above  we have established a valuation allowance to record the cantuzumab mertansine inventory at its estimated realizable value 
approximately  of the valuation allowance was recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  general and administrative salaries and related expenses  including estimated fiscal year bonuses that have been accrued  have increased  in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  professional services including legal and accounting fees  insurance costs and travel expenses increased  for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the approximate million  or  increase in general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to increased administrative and business development personnel costs  increased expenditures associated with investor relations and business development as well as the calendar year bonus awarded by the board of directors and the estimated eighteen month fiscal year bonuses that were accrued 
interest income interest income for the year ended june  decreased to million from million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   our average cash and investment balances were higher than during the same period in the prior year  resulting from our november public stock offering  a collaborator investment of million in september  receipt of million in warrant exercise proceeds in september  and receipt of million and million in collaborator payments during the year ended june  and the year ended june   respectively 
rates of return during the year ended june  were lower than during the comparable period in the prior year 
the impact of higher average cash and investment balances was offset by lower rates of return  so that our interest income during the year ended june  declined compared with that of the same period in the prior year 
interest income increased from to as a result of higher average cash and investment balances combined with higher rates of return 
realized gains on investments realized gains on investments were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in realized gains is attributable to the timing of investment sales 
there were no realized gains on investments during the year ended june  other income other income for the year ended june  decreased to  from  for the same period in the prior year 
other income in the year ended june  included our receipt of a cash payment in settlement of a securities litigation case filed on our behalf 
liquidity and capital resources june  cash and short term investments    working capital    stockholders equity    as of june   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
in november  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
net proceeds of the offering were million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes  including research and development 
since july   we have received million from collaborative and other financing sources 
these sources include milestone revenues earned under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline  genentech  abgenix  millennium and boehringer ingelheim  the sale of equity securities to abgenix and the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
net cash used in operations during the year ended june  was million compared to net cash used in operations of million in the year ended june  this increase in operational cash use is largely due to the increase in operating expenses discussed previously as well as the increase in clinical materials inventory produced on behalf of our collaborators 
during  we received million in upfront and milestone payments compared to million received in net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended june  and primarily represents the sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  and primarily represents our investment of excess cash in marketable securities 
capital purchases were million for the fiscal year ended june  and consisted primarily of costs associated with the build out of our existing norwood  massachusetts  development and pilot scale manufacturing facility 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million for the year ended june  versus million provided by financing activities for the year ended june  for the year ended june  net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from the exercise of  warrants and  stock options 
our total net proceeds from all common stock issued for the year ended june  were million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  includes proceeds from our november public offering of million shares of common stock as well as the exercise of  warrants and  stock options and the september  issuance of  shares of our common stock to abgenix 
our total net proceeds from all common stock issued for the year ended june  were million 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaborator payments  if any  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next three years 
we believe that the proceeds from our november public stock offering in addition to our established collaborative agreements will provide funding sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations under all collaborative agreements while also allowing us to develop product candidates and technologies not covered by collaborative agreements 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized 
should we not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
on august   we announced that  effective immediately  our board of directors had authorized the open market repurchase of up to million shares of immunogen common stock 
the repurchases are to be made at the discretion of management and as market conditions warrant 
no time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program 
as of september   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million 
we anticipate that we will purchase additional shares of our common stock and that the total cost of the shares repurchased will be significant 
as our repurchases are at management s discretion and subject to market conditions  we are unable to estimate the total cost of the repurchase program or the period during which such repurchases may take place 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the uncertainties associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the early stage of our initial product development and lack of product revenues  our history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  our lack of commercial manufacturing experience and commercial sales  distribution and marketing capabilities  reliance on suppliers of key materials necessary for production of our products and technologies  the potential development by competitors of competing products and technologies  our dependence on existing and potential collaborative partners  and the lack of assurance that we will receive any funding under such relationships to develop and maintain strategic alliances  the lack of assurance regarding patent and other protection for our proprietary technology  governmental regulation of our activities  facilities  products and personnel  the dependence on key personnel  uncertainties as to the extent of reimbursement for the costs of our potential products and related treatments by government and private health insurers and other organizations  the potential adverse impact of government directed health care reform  the risk of product liability claims  and economic conditions  both generally and those specifically related to the biotechnology industry 
as a result  our future development efforts involve a high degree of risk

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
