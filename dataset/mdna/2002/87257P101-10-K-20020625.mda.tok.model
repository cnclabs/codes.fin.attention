item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and critical accounting policies since  the principal business of the company has been the contract drilling of domestic onshore oil and gas wells 
in  the company began acquiring oil and gas properties and participating in the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
contract drilling operations drilling revenues from footage and daywork contracts are recognized as work is performed utilizing the percentage of completion method 
costs under footage and daywork contracts are recognized in the period they are incurred 
the company utilizes the completed contract method to recognize drilling revenues and expenses relating to turnkey contracts 
expected losses on all in process contracts are recognized in the period the loss can reasonably be determined 
drilling equipment is depreciated on a units of production method based on the monthly utilization of the equipment 
drilling equipment which is not utilized during a month is depreciated using a minimum utilization rate of approximately 
estimated useful lives range from four to eight years 
other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method of depreciation with estimated useful lives of three to seven years 
the contract drilling industry is currently experiencing a decrease in demand and downward pressure on prices for contract drilling services due to the uncertainty surrounding oil and gas prices 
the company has been and will continue to be affected by oil and gas industry conditions but cannot predict either the future level of demand for its contract drilling services or future conditions in the contract drilling industry 
the contract drilling industry remains highly competitive 
the company believes it owns a sufficient number of drilling rigs to remain competitive within its areas of operation 
in addition  the company believes it competes favorably with respect to the depth capabilities of its rigs  the experience level of its personnel  its reputation and its relationship with existing customers 
however  the company s operating results will continue to be directly affected by the level of drilling activity in the company s service areas 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s contract drilling operations for the periods indicated year ended march  in thousands  except s contract drilling revenues    contract drilling expenses    contract drilling expenses as a percent of drilling revenues rig utilization oil and gas operations the company s oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting 
accordingly  the company capitalizes all costs incurred to acquire oil and gas properties proved and unproved  all development costs  and the costs of successful exploratory wells 
the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
geological and geophysical costs  including seismic costs  are charged to expense when incurred 
in cases where the company provides contract drilling for oil and gas properties in which it has an ownership interest  the company s proportionate share of costs is capitalized as stated above  net of its working interest share of profits from the related drilling contracts 
capitalized costs of undeveloped properties  which are not depleted until proved reserves can be associated with the properties  are periodically reviewed for possible impairment 
such unevaluated costs totaled approximately  and  as of march   and march   respectively 
for properties with proved or proved developed oil and gas reserves  depletion  depreciation and amortization of capitalized costs was calculated for fiscal  and by applying the units of production method to the estimated amount of such reserves 
in fiscal  and  the company recognized non cash charges of approximately million  million and 
million  respectively  due to writedowns of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties 
the writedowns are the result of the adoption in of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties on a property by property basis 
according to sfas  if an impairment is indicated based on undiscounted future cash flows  then it is to be recognized to the extent that net capitalized costs exceed discounted future cash flows 
many assumptions are required for the company s impairment assessment when impairment indicators are present  including future prices and expenses  production volumes and drilling results 
changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on whether specific oil and gas properties fail the impairment test 
prices used for the impairment analysis at march  were per bbl and per mcf 
future impairment expense may be required on current properties if the company changes its pricing or cost assumptions in the future or if estimated future recoverable reserves decline 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s oil and gas operations for the periods indicated year ended march  in thousands oil and gas revenues    production expenses   dry holes and abandonments  exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization    writedown of properties   the company has not entered into hedging arrangements and does not have any delivery commitments 
while hedging arrangements reduce exposure to losses of resulting from unfavorable price changes  they also limit the ability to benefit from favorable market price changes 
results of operations comparison of year ended march  to year ended march  contract drilling revenues for fiscal increased by from fiscal rig utilization rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
the increase in contract drilling revenues was due to an increase in the average prices received for contract drilling services 
rig utilization in the company s operating market is difficult to project because of wide fluctuations in drilling activity 
in addition  the number of rigs industry wide that are actually available for work cannot be accurately determined 
contract drilling expenses were and of contract drilling revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in contract drilling expenses was primarily due to higher labor and trucking costs 
however  costs did not increase at the same rate as average rig rates 
oil and gas revenues remained relatively flat when comparing fiscal and although quantities produced of oil and gas on an equivalent barrel of oil basis increased by approximately  oil and gas revenues for fiscal were negatively affected by a decrease in prices received for crude oil and natural gas 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to oil and gas revenues fiscal year ended march  quantities oil bbls   gas mcf   average price oil bbls gas mcf oil and gas production expenses increased by and is a result of start up expenses for new wells coming on line coupled with an increase in the number of producing properties 
in addition  the company has experienced a general rise in the cost of services and supplies which are included in production expenses 
the company participated as a working interest owner in the drilling of wells during fiscal  of which three were dry holes 
in fiscal  the company participated as a working interest owner in the drilling of wells  of which nine were dry holes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased due to several factors 
the company has been purchasing drill pipe and drill collars and has updated and refurbished drilling rigs and engines 
the depreciable base of the company s assets increased by approximately million in fiscal and by approximately million in fiscal depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on oil and gas properties increased as a result of the increase in quantities of oil and gas produced as oil and gas properties are depleted using the units of production method 
also  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on oil and gas properties increased as a result of the number of oil and gas producing properties in which the company has an ownership interest a total of wells in fiscal versus wells in 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in payroll and insurance expenses 
the company recognized a non cash charge of million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to the writedown of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties 
net working capital was million at march   compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in cash and a decrease in trade payables and other current liabilities 
comparison of year ended march  to year ended march  contract drilling revenues for fiscal increased by from fiscal rig utilization rates in fiscal and were and  respectively 
the increase in contract drilling revenues and utilization rates was due to an increase in oil and gas prices which in turn positively impacted demand for contract drilling 
drilling prices have steadily increased during the year ended march  availability of experienced personnel has become a problem industry wide and certainly affects rig utilization 
historically  rig utilization in the company s operating market is difficult to project because of wide fluctuations in drilling activity 
in addition  the number of rigs industry wide that are actually available for work cannot be accurately determined 
contract drilling expenses were and of contract drilling revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease can be attributable to high start up costs that occurred in high start up costs are associated with putting rigs into service afer being idle or stacked for a period of time 
additionally  the decrease is a result of higher revenues due to increasing drilling prices 
oil and gas revenues increased by in fiscal this increase is a result of an increase in prices received for crude oil and natural gas 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to oil and gas revenues fiscal year ended march  quantities oil bbls   gas mcf   average price oil bbls gas mcf the decline in natural gas production from the prior year is due to the plugging and abandonment of two non operated natural gas wells in ward county  texas 
also  a recompletion of one well in pecos county  texas has negatively affected the current year s natural gas production 
in addition  the company s interest in a natural gas well in lea county  new mexico was reduced by because the well reached pay out status 
oil and gas production expenses increased by approximately 
this increase in production expenses can be attributed to the increased water production and workover on one well in gaines county  texas 
in addition  the company has experienced a general rise in the cost of services and supplies which are included in production expenses 
severance taxes increased along with the increase in oil and gas revenue 
also  the prior years results are affected by a recovery of an insurance claim concerning the loss of a well bore in lea county  new mexico 
the production expenses in the prior year reflect this recovery 
the company participated as a working interest owner in the drilling of wells during fiscal  of which nine were dry holes 
in fiscal  the company participated as a working interest owner in the drilling of wells  of which were dry holes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased due to several factors 
the increase in rig utilization rates caused an increase in depreciation expense as drilling equipment is depreciated using the units of production method based on the monthly utilization of the equipment 
during the year ended march   the company purchased a bdw rig with a depth capacity of approximately  feet 
this rig was put in service on february  the addition of the rig brought the company s available fleet to rigs

this amount is included in miscellaneous income 
the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately million in fiscal and 
million in fiscal related to the writedown of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties 
net working capital was million at march   compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in accounts receivable which relates to the increase in drilling activity 
income taxes at march   the company had approximately million of unused net operating loss nol carryforwards for tax purposes

liquidity and capital resources in june   the company entered into a second amended and restated loan agreement with wells fargo bank texas  na the loan agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit facility  of which million was available at june  the facility is secured by the company s drilling rigs and related equipment  accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank s base rate  or at june  accrued and unpaid interest on outstanding principal is payable monthly 
the loan facility matures on august   at which time all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full 
at march   no amounts were outstanding under the loan facility 
the principal amount outstanding at any one time may not exceed the lesser of million or one third of the borrowing base amount 
the borrowing base amount is the sum of the company s accounts receivable and the value of its inventory  drilling rigs  drill pipe and related equipment 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined quarterly by the company  except that the bank may  in its discretion  make its own determination of the borrowing base which will be the controlling borrowing base amount 
at march   the borrowing base amount was  in addition to certain customary affirmative covenants  the loan agreement contains restrictions with respect to i incurring additional debt  incurring or permitting liens to exist on any of the company s property  assets or revenues  ii declaring or paying dividends or other distributions on its capital stock or acquiring any of its capital stock  iii issuing capital stock  iv entering into transactions with affiliates  v disposing of assets  and vi certain other matters

the company anticipates that funds for its capital expenditures in fiscal will be available from a combination of sources  including i borrowings under the line of credit  ii funds raised through issuances of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  and iii internally generated funds 
the following table sets forth information regarding the capital expenditures made by the company during the last three fiscal years 
year ended march  in thousands oil and gas exploration and development    drilling rigs  drill pipe and related equipment    other total    the company presently anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million in its fiscal year 
of this amount  the company expects that approximately million will be spent for the acquisition of drill pipe  drill collars and related equipment  and approximately million for oil and gas exploration and development activities 
it is the company s policy  however  to make capital expenditures based on prevailing economic conditions  the results of its drilling activities  and other factors affecting its business 
accordingly  the amounts actually spent in fiscal could differ substantially from the amounts estimated 
trends and prices the contract drilling industry is currently experiencing decreased demand and decreasing prices for contract drilling services due to the instability of oil and gas prices 
the company will be affected by price fluctuations in the industry  but cannot predict either the future level of demand for its contract drilling services or future conditions in the contract drilling industry 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as by actions of state and local agencies  the us and foreign governments and international cartels 
the company has no way of accurately predicting the supply of and demand for oil and gas  domestic or international political events or the effects of any such factors on the prices received by the company for its oil and gas 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary sources of market risk for the company include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rate fluctuations 
at march   the company had not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other similar agreements relating to crude oil and natural gas 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
as a result  its operating results are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces 
historically  the company has not entered into hedging arrangements for its oil and gas production and it does not have any delivery commitments 
the company may  in the future  attempt to reduce its exposure to the volatility of oil and gas prices by hedging a portion of its production 
in a typical hedge transaction  the company would have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedge 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  the company would be required to pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
in the case  the company would be required to pay the difference regardless of whether it had sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require the company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging could also prevent the hedging party from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil and gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
interest rate risk at march  the company had no borrowings outstanding under its loan agreement 
however  when it does have outstanding borrowings  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from short term changes in its bank s prime rate
