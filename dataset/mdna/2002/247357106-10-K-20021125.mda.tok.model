item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the decrease in planted cotton acreage in the us during adversely impacted our results for the fiscal year ended august  in a report dated june   the united states department of agriculture reported planted cotton acreage in the us was expected to total million acres 
this represented an drop from the previous year s estimate of million acres 
however  our estimate of actual planted cotton acreage in ranges from to million acres 
the combined effect of low cotton commodity prices and relatively higher soybean and corn prices  along with the late enactment of the farm security and rural investment act of the farm bill on may   resulted in many growers not planting cotton for the crop year 
the late passage of the farm bill coupled with lower cotton prices were especially felt in areas where stripper cotton varieties are grown 
because the revenue potential per acre for stripper cotton varieties is significantly lower than the potential for picker cotton varieties  farmers in the stripper areas used cost cutting measures  including reduced seeding rates per acre and planting conventional seed and or farmer saved seed 
our earnings for fiscal were also negatively impacted by crop destruct program claims  which were significantly higher than in the prior year due to wet and unusually cool conditions that existed in the mid south early in the growing season 
under the crop destruct program  if a farmer plants transgenic seed and his crop is destroyed within sixty days of planting  then monsanto  after field inspection  will forgive or waive the technology fee on the affected acreage 
in addition  seed production problems early in the year related to certain roundup ready cottonseed varieties reduced seed availability which also affected our earnings  since we were unable to fill the demand for certain varieties 
on a positive note  we were able to increase our gross margin percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal  principally due to price increases for certain of our cotton planting seed 
the price increases  coupled with the factors noted above  contributed to a reduction in unit sales and market share 
these price increases were partially offset by higher costs for fuzzy cotton seed  our raw material 
results from our international operations were negatively affected by lower planted acreage in key cotton producing countries where we operate 
we have also felt the impact of farmers planting saved seed and or counterfeit seed in china and argentina 
soybean sales for the year exceeded both sales and expectations  due primarily to improved product performance in  more competitive pricing and marketing programs in and a increase in soybean acreage in our primary marketing area 
strategic transactions and events in may  we signed a product development agreement with syngenta whereby syngenta will pay us for development work  including introgression  testing and evaluation  of syngenta s insect resistance technology in our elite cotton germplasm 
if appropriate testing indicates that syngenta technology combined with our germplasm is competitive and if a commercialization agreement is reached  our elite varieties containing syngenta s technology could potentially be available for introduction to growers as early as  subject to syngenta obtaining us government regulatory approval and other factors 
in may  we established deltamax cotton  llc  a limited liability company jointly owned with verdia  a wholly owned subsidiary of maxygen  inc deltamax cotton  llc was formed to create  develop and commercialize value enhancing traits for the cottonseed market that will complement and or compete with traits available today 
d pl and verdia each own of deltamax cotton  llc and we expect to invest in the aggregate up to million over the next five to eight years to fund our portion of deltamax cotton  llc  which includes estimated expenses of million in  and million in in may  we acquired the interest in d m international  llc we did not own from pharmacia for approximately million 
pharmacia activated a cross purchase provision in the operating agreement for d m international  llc  and we elected to have d m international  llc redeem pharmacia s interest in d m international  llc  rather than having d m international  llc redeem our interest 
in june  we announced that murray robinson would retire as president and chief executive officer effective august   and that wt jagodinski  who was named executive vice president effective june   would succeed robinson as president and chief executive officer  effective september  in addition  rick greene  d pl vice president of business development  was named vice president finance  treasurer and assistant secretary  effective june  effective september   w 
t 
jagodinski became a member of the d pl board of directors 
his term will last until d pl s annual meeting when shareholders will vote upon his re election 
his addition to the board brings the total number of directors to seven 
other matters we completed the plant closing and reorganization of the corporate staff announced in august  which resulted in us taking a million charge in the prior year 
essentially all severance payments were made by the end of the prior fiscal year 
the changes were made to reduce plant capacity  production costs  and corporate overhead by eliminating positions and realigning our soybean breeding efforts 
with respect to our suit against pharmacia and monsanto company  the parties remain in discovery 
the judge in the case has ruled that all discovery  depositions  and pre trial motions must be completed by september with a trial date set for january our earnings for the fiscal year were impacted by legal expenses of per share during the year  as the discovery and other pre trial activities have intensified 
as discussed in item and the footnotes to the financial statements  we collected in fiscal after we filed a lawsuit the million termination fee and recorded it net of related expenses as an unusual item 
outlook future growth in sales and earnings will be dependent on a cotton acreage in the us and around the world  b our ability to continue to profitably expand our international operations  c the successful development and launch of new technologies obtained from third parties with fee sharing arrangements that are more beneficial to us than current fee sharing arrangements and d our ability to successfully develop and launch technologies that we will own or have more control over such as those being developed by deltamax cotton  llc 
due to our market position in the us  us cotton acreage has a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
although we expect the farm bill to stabilize and potentially increase us cotton acreage  other factors such as weather and commodity prices at or near the time farmers plant will have a significant effect on farmer planting decisions and  ultimately  our operating results 
as we have previously announced  we expect to provide earnings guidance later this year 
even though we believe the farm bill will have a positive effect on acreage  it is too early to predict with confidence the level of cotton acreage  since the farm bill is only one of the many elements a farmer considers when making planting decisions 
internationally  we continue to expand our global reach and we seek to improve the operating results of our existing ex us operations 
in  planted cotton acreage declined in many key international markets where we operate due to low fiber prices 
in fiscal  we acquired the interest in d m international  llc from pharmacia 
this strategic step will make it easier for us to introduce new technologies from third parties when they become available and gain regulatory approval in the countries where the joint ventures  partially owned by d m international  llc  operate 
we will continue to develop new businesses in markets such as india  pakistan and portions of africa 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we had signed letters of intent with two parties in china to form two new joint ventures there  one each in hubei and henan provinces 
however  in april  china announced rules prohibiting new foreign investment in seed companies that intend to sell genetically modified seed which will restrict the ability of non chinese companies  including us  from investing in such joint ventures 
we have  however  signed a distribution agreement with a party in the henan province and will be distributing seed there in fiscal from our joint venture in hebei province  ji dai 
we expect to continue to expand our business in china through our existing joint ventures  ji dai and an dai 
we continue to review and evaluate alternative sources and types of technology that could bring valuable products to farmers 
as agreements are reached with those parties  announcements will be made 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to rapidly introduce new technologies to both us and us cotton farmers due to the strength and breadth of our breeding programs and germplasm base  and our technical services capabilities  know how  brand recognition and market position 
share repurchase program dividend policy our board of directors has previously approved a common stock repurchase plan of up to million 
we expect to continue purchasing shares in the open market subject to market price and other considerations 
currently  the quarterly dividend is per share 
the board reviews the dividend policy quarterly 
assuming the dividend rate is maintained through  the aggregate payments will be million to the holders of the million common shares outstanding and million to the holder of the million preferred shares outstanding 
see risks and uncertainties located in this item net sales and licensing fees in  our consolidated net sales and licensing fees decreased to million from sales of million 
this decrease was mainly attributable to a a reduction in planted cotton acreage in the us that reduced domestic sales to million in from million in  b a reduction in international sales to million in from million in  c a loss in market share caused primarily by a price increase and the inability to fill demand for certain roundup ready picker cotton varieties  and d higher marketing program costs 
the effects of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in soybean seed sales and licensing fees  which increased approximately in from sales of transgenic cotton seed comprised approximately of total domestic cotton seed sales  up from approximately in in  our consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
this increase was primarily the result of a a continued market penetration of our stacked gene products in the domestic segment  b price increases in the domestic cotton segment  c increased export sales to mexico  greece  and brazil and d increased sales by our joint ventures in china and brazil 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by lower than expected sales of soybeans 
in  domestic transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in mexico  greece  china  and brazil 
in  soybean sales and licensing fees decreased from gross profit our consolidated gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to in from in this was primarily attributable to price increases for certain of our cotton seed  partially offset by higher costs of fuzzy seed 
our consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to continued penetration of transgenic cottonseed varieties in the us  a price increase in the us market  and increased sales in our international segment as discussed above  the positive effects of which were partly offset by lower soybean margins 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was mainly attributable to cost savings realized from the plant closing and staff reductions announced in  as well as reduced health insurance claims and a reduction in the discretionary bonus pool 
operating expenses before special charges increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative and research costs which were partially offset by continued cost savings generated from our reorganization of the sales and marketing staff and the related synergies of our advertising and promotional efforts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the restructuring of third party research contracts  as well as cost savings realized from the reorganization announced in contributed to the decrease experienced in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional breeding programs in georgia and texas  advanced breeding programs  evaluation of new technologies  and additional international seed testing 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased to million in from million in the reorganization announced in produced cost savings in the selling function  as did a reduction in our advertising expenditures 
selling expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to our previous reorganization of the sales and marketing staff and the related synergies of combining our advertising and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in health insurance claims and a decrease in the discretionary bonus pool  offset by higher legal costs primarily related to structuring and negotiating agreements to access and license new technologies 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily consisted of an increase in property  casualty and health insurance costs 
special charges and unusual item in  in connection with the closing of our chandler  arizona delinting facility and the reduction in our domestic operations and corporate staffs  we recorded a million charge associated with these actions 
of the million  million was related to the write down of fixed assets and million to severance pay and related benefits 
no special charges were recorded in in fiscal  we reported  as an unusual income item  the million merger termination fee  net of related expenses  which was paid by monsanto to us pursuant to the terms of the may   merger agreement 
interest income expense net interest income decreased to million in  compared to net interest income of million in in  interest income was million and interest expense was million 
lower interest rates earned on our cash resulted in lower interest earnings during international interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in interest rates incurred on debt at our joint venture in argentina 
net interest income was and million in and  respectively 
in  interest income was million and interest expense was million 
in  interest income was million and interest expense was million 
the interest income was primarily earned on cash generated from operating activities and the million merger termination fee collected from monsanto in early net income and earnings per share net income after special charges and unusual items applicable to common shares was  million and million in  and  respectively 
net income per share diluted after special charges and unusual items was  and in  and  respectively 
net income per share diluted before legal  special charges and unusual items was  and in  and  respectively 
legal expenses related to our suit against pharmacia and monsanto totaled per diluted share in and per diluted share in the cost of the reorganization was per share 
the number of shares used in diluted earnings per share calculations was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
application of critical accounting policies overview management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified below the accounting policies that involve those estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below 
since application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition as discussed elsewhere in this document  all of our domestic seed products including those containing bollgard and roundup ready technologies are subject to return and credit risk  the effects of which vary from year to year 
the annual level of returns and  ultimately  net sales are influenced by various factors  principally commodity prices and weather conditions occurring in the spring planting season during our third and fourth quarters 
we provide for estimated returns as sales occur 
to the extent actual returns differ from estimates  adjustments to our operating results are recorded when such differences become known  typically in our fourth quarter 
all significant returns occur or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
therefore  the application of this estimate primarily affects our quarterly information 
we also offer various sales incentive programs for seed and participate in such programs related to the bollgard and roundup ready technology fees offered by monsanto 
generally  under these programs  if a farmer plants his seed and the crop is lost usually due to weather by a certain date a portion of the price of the seed and the technology fees is forgiven or rebated to the farmer 
the amount of the refund and the impact to d pl depends on whether the farmer can replant the crop that was destroyed 
we record estimates monthly to account for these events  the majority of which occur during the second and third quarters 
essentially all material claims under these programs have occurred or are accounted for by fiscal year end 
provision for damaged  obsolete and excess inventory each year  we record a provision related to inventory based on our estimate of seed that will not pass our quality assurance qa standards at year end  or is deemed excess based on our desired seed stock level for a particular variety dump seed 
seed can fail qa standards based on physical defects ie  cut seed  moisture content  discoloration  etc  germination rates  or transgenic qualities 
the amount recorded as inventory provision in a given year is calculated based on the total quantity of inventory that has not passed qa standards at any fiscal period end  any seed that is expected to deteriorate before it can be sold and seed deemed to be excess and is valued at the average cost of inventory 
in establishing the provision we consider the scrap value of the seed to be disposed 
an initial estimate of the needed provision is made at the beginning of each year and recorded ratably over the course of the year 
adjustments are made monthly  as necessary 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further details about inventory reserves 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are estimated based upon temporary differences between the income and losses that we report in our financial statements and our taxable income and losses as determined under applicable tax laws 
we estimate the value of deferred income taxes based upon existing tax rates and laws  and our expectations of future earnings 
we estimate our composite statutory income tax rate to be approximately 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income that will enable us to realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
if  in our judgment  we determine that we will not realize deferred tax assets  then valuation allowances are recorded 
as of august   we had recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we estimate that our deferred tax assets will be realized  therefore we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of august  we use management judgment and estimates when estimating deferred taxes 
if our judgments and estimates prove to be inadequate  or if certain tax rates and laws should change  our financial results could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources in the united states  we purchase seed from contract growers in our first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal cash needs normally begin to increase in the first fiscal quarter and cash needs peak in the third fiscal quarter 
cash is generated and loan repayments  if necessary  normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
in some cases  we offer customers financial incentives to make early payments 
to the extent we attract early payments from customers  bank borrowings  if any  are reduced 
in the u 
s  we record revenue and accounts receivable for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales upon shipment  usually in our second and third quarters 
receivables from seed sales are generally due from may to july 
in september  the licensing fees are due at which time we receive payment 
we then pay monsanto its royalty  which is recorded as a component of cost of sales  for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees 
as a result of the timing of these events  licensing fees receivable and royalties payable peak at fiscal year end 
the seasonal nature of our business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
historically  we have maintained credit facilities  and used early payments by customers and cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
in the past  we have borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
however  in  we used cash generated from operations and other available cash to meet working capital needs 
we continue to evaluate potential uses of our cash for purposes other than for working capital needs 
one potential such use is the acquisition or funding of alternative technologies such as deltamax cotton  llc that could be used to enhance our product portfolio and ultimately our long term earnings potential 
another potential use is the repurchase in the open market of our shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program 
for the twelve months ended august   we repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
once the evaluation of certain transactions that are currently being considered is brought to conclusion  we may consider other potential uses of the remaining cash  including repurchasing shares more aggressively depending on market considerations and other factors 
in april  we entered into a syndicated credit facility with three lenders  which provided for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement provided a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the base commitment was a long term loan that could be borrowed upon at any time and was due april  the seasonal commitment was a working capital loan that could be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year 
each commitment offered variable and fixed interest rate options and required d pl to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
this agreement expired on april  d pl and the lenders are negotiating a replacement facility that will provide for aggregate borrowings sufficient to meet working capital needs that will contain terms and conditions similar to the facility 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate to million in the board of directors anticipates that quarterly dividends of per share will continue to be paid in the future  however  the board of directors reviews this policy quarterly 
aggregate preferred and common dividends paid in were million and should approximate million in cash provided from operations  cash on hand  early payments from customers and borrowings under a loan agreement  if necessary  should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
in february  the board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the shares repurchased under this program are to be used to provide for option exercises  conversion of our series m convertible non voting preferred shares and for other general corporate purposes 
at august   we had repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million under this program 
we purchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of million under this plan during the year ended august  between september  and october   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of million 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  we may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  new technologies  research and development activities  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business include those noted elsewhere in this filing and the following demand for our seed will be affected by government programs and policies and by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  cottonseed oil  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and our products face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
our seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of our competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than we 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments 
particular policies which may affect our domestic and international operations include the use of and the acceptance of products that were produced from plants that have been genetically modified  the testing  quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact our international operations 
the publicity related to genetically modified organisms gmos or products made from plants that contain gmos may have an effect on our sales in the future 
in  approximately of our cottonseed that was sold in the united states contained either or both of monsanto s bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  and of our soybean seed sales contained the roundup ready gene technology 
although many farmers have rapidly adopted these technologies  the concern of some customers and governmental entities over finished products that contain gmos could impact demand for crops and ultimately seed raised from seed containing such traits 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which we operate and because of factors within the particular international markets we target  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth 
furthermore  recent action taken by the us government  including that taken by the us military in the aftermath of the tragic events of september   and conflicts between major cotton producing nations may serve to further complicate our ability to execute our long range ex us business plans because those plans include future expansion into uzbekistan  pakistan and india 
overall profitability will depend on the factors noted above as well as weather conditions  government policies in all countries where we sell products and operate  worldwide commodity prices  our ability to successfully open new international markets  our ability to successfully continue the development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and d pl are working  our technology partners ability to successfully defend challenges to proprietary technologies licensed to us and our ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure relative to fluctuations in the price of soybean raw material inventory  foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
from time to time we enter into various agreements that are considered derivatives to reduce our commodity price risk 
during the year ended august   derivative instruments have not been used to manage foreign currency or interest rate risks  except in a specific instance in which one of our foreign subsidiaries entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate our risk associated with currency fluctuations in foreign currency denominated debt 
we do not enter into speculative hedges or purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item further information on our exposure to market risk is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item the fair value of derivative commodity instruments outstanding as of august   was  a adverse change in the underlying commodity prices upon which these contracts are based would result in a  loss in future earnings  arising from these contracts not counting the gain on the underlying commodities 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
we conduct non us operations through subsidiaries and joint ventures in  primarily  argentina  australia  brazil  china  south africa and turkey 
at august   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would not cause a material impact on earnings 
we utilize fixed and variable rate debt to maintain liquidity and fund our business operations  with the terms and amounts based on business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
at august   a basis point change in interest rates with all other variables held constant on the portion of our debt with variable interest rates would not result in a material change to our interest expense or cash flow 
for the year ended august   a adverse change in the interest rate that we earned on our excess cash that we invested would not have resulted in a material change to our interest expense or cash flow
