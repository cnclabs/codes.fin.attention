we discontinued the practice of providing a free wash to lube customers resulting in decreased lube revenues but improved overall site gross margin performance 
the decline in fuel and merchandise gross revenues is the result of instituting certain minimum sale margin criteria which reduced gross fuel sales and the sale of certain low margin merchandise 
during a portion of and  we managed several car wash locations under operating agreements  under which we were entitled to all profits generated from the operation of those locations

selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to the million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the primary reason for this increase is the infrastructure established during the months ended december  in order to effectively enter the car care industry and execute our growth strategy

this increase is partially offset by cost controls placed on previously private companies and favorable pricing for supplies  insurance  other indirect costs due to economies of scale  and the elimination of costs at our security products facility

during the year ended december   the costs of previously capitalized expenditures related to proposed acquisitions totaled approximately  these costs  which principally related to several possible acquisitions we pursued outside the car wash industry  are primarily related to due diligence costs

interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is principally the result of borrowings for acquisitions during and other income and expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was primarily due to a pre tax gain of approximately  on the sale of our facility in morrisville  pennsylvania in  offset partially by a reduction in certain rental income in other income for the year ended december  was  as compared to other income of  in this increase in other income was due primarily to additional rental income received from renting out excess space at wash facilities acquired during and income taxes we recorded income tax expense benefit from continuing operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

at december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
components of the net operating loss carryforwards include million from continuing operations and million from acquired net operating losses attributable to the colonial full service car wash  inc acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires substantial amounts of capital  most notably to pursue our acquisition strategy and for equipment purchases and upgrades 
we plan to meet these capital needs from various financing sources  including borrowings  internally generated funds  and the issuance of common stock as the market price of our stock improves 
we estimate aggregate capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  of approximately  for the year ending december  as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was approximately million  net cash used in financing activities was approximately million and net cash provided by investing activities was approximately  resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year of approximately million 
capital expended during the period included  for the purchase of operating equipment and real estate 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million 
we had two letters of credit outstanding at december   totaling  as collateral relating to worker compensation insurance policies 
we do not have a revolving credit facility 
during  we refinanced on a long term basis under favorable terms the majority of our short term debt related to our and acquisitions 
in february  we entered into a million term loan with bank one  texas  na bank one to refinance the remaining balance of a short term promissory note related to the genie acquisition and entered into several new loan agreements with bank one to finalize the assumption of notes held by bank one relating to the colonial acquisition 
additionally  in november  we entered into a million three year term note year amortization basis with bank one to refinance a million convertible promissory note to bullseye properties assumed in connection with the acquisition of eager beaver  a million southtrust bank note scheduled to mature in may  and a million promissory note related to the red baron truck wash acquisition 
the bank one term note also provided approximately  for the purchase of the leased beneva car wash property and approximately million of additional funding  net of loan closing costs  for capital improvements and working capital 
we also had various other long term mortgage notes up for periodic review during which we have been successful in renewing 
several of our debt agreements  as amended  contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and require the maintenance of certain levels of tangible net worth and the maintenance of certain debt coverage ratios on an individual subsidiary and consolidated level 
on april   we executed a master facility agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion pursuant to which fusion agreed to enter into up to two equity purchase agreements  each with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the equity purchase agreements allow us to suspend the purchasing of our common stock by fusion if the price of our common stock is less than per share 
we are currently not permitting the purchase of our common stock under the equity purchase agreement due to the current low trading value of our common stock and the potentially dilutive effect of such stock purchases 
if and when we agree to the purchase of our stock  fusion has the right to purchase from us shares of common stock up to million at a price equal to the lesser of of the average of the closing bid prices for our common stock during the trading days prior to the date of the applicable equity purchase agreement or  whichever is greater or a price based upon the future performance of the common stock  in each case without any fixed discount to the market price 
as long as we have not suspended fusion from purchasing our stock  the equity purchase agreement requires that at the beginning of each month  fusion will pay us million as partial prepayment for the common stock 
once the million has been applied to purchase shares of our common stock  fusion will pay the remaining principal amount upon receipt of our common stock 
the first equity purchase agreement was executed by fusion on april  proceeds from purchased shares through december  totaled approximately million 
the first equity purchase agreement was extended to february  the second equity purchase agreement will be executed after delivery of an irrevocable written notice by us to fusion stating that we elect to enter into such purchase agreement with fusion 
the second equity purchase agreement may be entered into only after the principal amount under the first equity purchase agreement is fully converted into our common stock 
seasonality and inflation we believe that our car washing and detailing operations are adversely affected by periods of inclement weather 
we have mitigated and intend to continue to mitigate the impact of inclement weather through geographic diversification of our operations 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are not materially exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
interest rate exposure a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  and as such  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results unless and until such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
all of our variable rate debt obligations are tied to the prime rate  as is our incremental borrowing rate 
therefore  a one percent increase in the prime rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of our variable rate debt at december
