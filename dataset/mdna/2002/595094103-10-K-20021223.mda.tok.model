products and technology micromuse provides a suite of software products that enables service and business assurance for enterprises and service providers 
our netcool solutions include the flagship netcool omnibus application  which collects  consolidates  de duplicates and correlates information from more than network management platforms and devices and presents realtime user configurable views of faults  network  service and business status 
the application allows network operations personnel to react to problems in the network infrastructure before they cause outages in service availability and or to identify outages and their probable causes 
these capabilities enable network managers to improve the reliability and functionality of their networks  thereby enhancing operating efficiencies  productivity and profitability of network operators and users 
the components of netcool omnibus are described in the section entitled netcool omnibus components 
micromuse also provides enhanced applications that work in conjunction with the netcool omnibus application 
these include the netcool service monitors suite  the netcool reporter application  the netcool impact application  the netcool visionary application  the netcool precision application and the netcool service level agreement management slam application 
the netcool service monitors suite not only manages network and system devices  but also looks at service and application availability from the customer s perspective 
collectively  the suite monitors the real time availability  throughput  latency rates  utilization levels  and other key performance metrics for internet based services and protocols  wireless services and applications  mainframe and distributed server environments  and data equipment including switches  routers  and hubs 
netcool service monitors can be configured to measure performance against pre defined thresholds  allowing operators to ensure compliance with service level agreements 
the netcool reporter application takes netcool omnibus data and provides historical reports on events occurring within a network infrastructure 
the netcool impact application facilitates policy based management and helps determine how netcool omnibus collected faults will impact the availability of services 
the netcool visionary application facilitates network problem diagnosis 
the netcool precision application provides infrastructure inventory  discovery and topology data  and relays realtime information about the underlying sources of connectivity based failures 
the netcool slam application allows users to define  model and monitor end to end services 
furthermore  netcool slam monitors adhere to defined service level thresholds  providing warnings when thresholds are about to be breached as well as measuring the length of periods of non compliance 
in addition  the netcool suite includes a series of software solutions targeted to specific customer environments 
these solutions include netcool for voice networks netcool for security management netcool for enterprise management 
table of contents netcool omnibus components netcool omnibus is based on an open  client server architecture 
it consists of four primary components the netcool objectserver  which is at the heart of the architecture  netcool probes gateways  netcool desktops  and netcool webtop 
netcool probes collect fault information from network element management systems  network devices  computing systems  applications or legacy systems 
netcool probes then normalize and consolidate this data into the netcool objectserver  a high speed  memory resident database  optimized for realtime fault monitoring and building views of network status and service availability 
by manipulating the data in the netcool objectserver  netcool desktop and webtop users can access customized views of event data to monitor segments of the infrastructure as well as services that span the entire infrastructure 
netcool gateways permit data to be shared between multiple objectservers for load balancing or fail over facilities  exported to common relational database management systems oracle  sybase  etc 
for historical service level views  or integrated with other applications such as helpdesk applications remedy  clarify  etc netcool objectserver the netcool objectserver is a realtime  object oriented  memory resident  active database that stores and manages the collected network faults and service status data 
the netcool objectserver consolidates  associates and de duplicates normalized data from the netcool probes monitors  converting events  such as faults and alarms  into event objects that can be easily manipulated to create associations and filters 
the active components of the netcool objectserver include its de duplication capability and its ability to correlate event objects with other event objects  make decisions on information  automate operator responses and facilitate problem resolution 
the netcool objectserver  which has been designed and optimized for handling large volumes of events messages  can process hundreds of alarms per second and can collect data from multiple netcool probes concurrently 
the netcool objectserver architecture also permits multiple authenticated users to view all the events throughout the enterprise 
in addition  since one network fault can impact several locations in a distributed environment and can therefore trigger multiple events  the netcool objectserver is designed to automatically de duplicate repeated events so that network operators can easily identify the root cause 
the netcool objectserver architecture provides us with a competitive advantage in both the speed with which it collects network events and the ability to associate event information with the services it manages 
netcool probes netcool probes are passive supersets of software code that collect network event data including messaged network data such as faults  alerts  and traps from elements on the network or from domain based network management systems 
these probes can collect information from management platforms eg hp openview and aprisma spectrum  specific devices eg switches  routers  hubs  lans wans  signaling systems and optical networks and standard protocols eg screen oriented ascii character streams  application log files ie syslog tl  snmp  and most other standard methods of management information provision 
netcool probes recognize management information base mib information from leading vendors  including cisco  ericsson  nortel  alcatel  lucent  siemens  marconi and many others 
they use rules and lookup tables to categorize and add information to events 
as a result  network data collected by the netcool probes is normalized into a common alert format and then passed to the netcool objectserver 
netcool gateways netcool gateways are interfaces to third party applications that allow sharing of netcool event data 
for example  netcool objectserver data can be exported through netcool gateways to relational databases for historical analysis and reporting  or to trouble ticketing packages for automated ticket generation 
in addition  multiple netcool objectservers can share data using a netcool gateway to offer customers load balancing and failover facilities 

table of contents netcool desktop the netcool desktop is an integrated suite of software tools designed for use by operators and administrators to create filters  customize views of network event data  monitor several services simultaneously  and automatically resolve service problems 
network operators can quickly build filters by responding to simple onscreen queries about user preferences 
operators can also associate events with services through the use of simple drag and drop technology that automatically creates the boolean logic and software query language required to retrieve the data from the netcool objectserver 
in this way  non programmers can manipulate the data in the netcool objectserver to custom design views of event data 
in addition  each operator can use netcool desktops to resolve element problems directly or automate responses to common network problems when critical thresholds are reached 
operators can use netcool desktops to monitor services through netcool eventlists  netcool eventlist dashboards summary or netcool maps 
the netcool eventlist presents a configurable spreadsheet like view of the de duplicated faults and acts as the primary interface through which operators access problem resolution tools 
the netcool eventlist dashboard summary depicts a concise view of the eventlists for several services while the netcool map provides a graphical view of the network or services that depend upon it 
administrators can use desktops to configure the netcool objectserver and the operator s netcool desktop environment 
netcool desktops run on multiple platforms  including web browsers  unix motif  and microsoft windows nt 
netcool webtop the netcool webtop is a highly functional  web enabled version of netcool desktop 
the netcool webtop allows netcool event and service views to be disseminated to wide  remote and distributed audiences via the internet 
after gaining password protected access to a netcool webtop  users can interact with the event data contained within a netcool objectserver in virtually the same way that they would through a proprietary desktop client 
sales and marketing we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organization with american offices in chicago  dallas  new york  san francisco  and mclean  virginia  and international offices in australia  austria  brazil  china  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  poland  singapore  spain  the united arab emirates  and the united kingdom  among other locations 
additionally  we have a growing channel consisting of oems  value added resellers and systems integrators 
typically  the sales process will include an initial sales presentation  a product demonstration  at times a proof of concept evaluation  a closing meeting and a purchase process 
the sales process can take up to nine months  although we have experienced longer and less predictable cycles 
companies often start with a moderate deployment of certain netcool software components  and upon its demonstrated effectiveness subsequently make additional and larger purchases 
a majority of our sales are from repeat customers who generally purchase additional software as their networks expand  or as additional sites within a customer learn of the services provided by  and the benefits of  netcool 
we have a number of marketing programs designed to inform potential customers about the capabilities and benefits of our products 
our marketing efforts include investing in our technical leadership  participation in industry trade shows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  analyzing returns on investment in our software  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals and advertising 
if we are to achieve significant revenue growth in the future  we must successfully train and retain our existing sales force and recruit additional premier sales personnel  if needed  and increase their productivity 

table of contents competition for such individuals is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to either retain and adequately train our current sales force or attract qualified sales personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain  train or hire such people and make them productive on a timely basis  our business  operating results or financial condition would be adversely affected 
to achieve significant growth in revenues in the future we must continue to expand and improve the performance of our network of distribution partners 
our network of distribution partners currently includes vars  systems integrators and oem partners  such as cisco systems  ericsson data services  nortel  alcatel and sun microsystems 
these partners license our products at a discount to list price for re licensing and may provide training  support and technical and customer services to the end users of the our products 
at times  members of our technical services organization will assist a channel partner with training and technical support 
we offer a comprehensive channel partnering program consisting of training  certification  technical support  priority communications regarding upcoming activities and products  and joint sales and marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain vars  systems integrators and oems or that such organizations will be able to market and sell our products effectively 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our existing or future channel partners will continue to represent our products 
see risk factors we need to continue to expand our distribution channels and retain our existing third party distributors 
in part  because we first sold our software in the united kingdom and were previously domiciled in london  sales of our software outside of the united states ie  international sales have historically comprised a significant portion of our total revenue 
international sales accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
a majority of these international sales were made to customers in the united kingdom and continental europe 
while we believe there are significant opportunities in europe  we expect international revenues from europe as a percentage of total revenues to decline in future periods as we more fully exploit opportunities in the united states and in the pacific rim 
see risk factors our business is subject to risks from global operations and we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
technical services our technical services organization provides customers with a broad range of support services including pre sales demonstrations  evaluations  implementations  consulting services  training and ongoing technical support 
in addition  the technical services organization serves a variety of internal functions  including drafting support and training documentation  product management  product testing  research and development related to specific customer industries 
our expansion of the customer base of netcool has increased the demands on our technical services organization 
competition for qualified technical personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the current resources in our technical services organization will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business 
the failure to align our technical services organization at least commensurate with the expansion in the installed base of netcool products would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see risk factors we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
customer support the customer support organization is responsible for providing ongoing technical support for our customers after implementation of the product and for training the next generation of our software engineers and technical services personnel 
based on feedback by customers  we believe that the quality and responsiveness of our customer support organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage 

table of contents for an annual maintenance fee  a customer will receive toll free telephone and email support  as well as certain new releases of our products 
we offer two support packages to our customers hours a day  days a week support or hours a day  days a week support 
while support personnel generally answer the technical support calls and resolve most problems over the phone  we will deploy one of our technical support personnel in the event that an on site visit is necessary 
as our installed base of netcool customers has grown  revenue from maintenance fees has grown 
due to more recent general economic and specific customer factors and the reliability of our products  some customers have chosen to reduce or forego their maintenance coverage 
we are implementing initiatives to counter these trends but there can be no assurance that maintenance revenue will continue at its current level or will continue its historic growth 
the failure to grow maintenance revenue would have a material adverse impact on our business results and financial condition 
research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop new products that maintain technological and operational competitiveness and leadership and deliver a rapid roi to our customers 
we have historically developed and expect to continue to develop our products in conjunction with our existing and potential customers 
extensive product development input is obtained through customers  through our monitoring of end user needs and changes in the marketplace and through partnerships with leading research institutes 
our research and development organization spans the united states and united kingdom  and includes team members who have joined micromuse through our acquisitions of calvin alexander networking  netops  and riversoft plc 
research and development teams are organized around specific products and product families 
these teams work closely with customers  product managers  technical service engineers  and salespeople to ensure that product specifications and enhancements are aligned to market requirements 
we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
our total expenses for research and development  exclusive of purchased research and development costs  for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
to date  our development efforts have not resulted in any capitalized software development costs 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or our competitors embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and features  or that our new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
see risk factors rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete and our products operate on third party software platforms  and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
in addition  software products as complex as ours may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements are 
table of contents released 
see risk factors if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance or our products and our reputation will be harmed  and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
competition as noted above  our products are designed for use in the evolving business and service assurance and enterprise network management markets 
competition in these markets is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  new and evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the slm service level management and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories i customer s internal design and development organizations that produce homegrown slm and network management applications for their particular needs  ii vendors who provide enterprise network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc ca and bmc software  inc  iii vendors who provide service provider network and systems management frameworks including agilent and tti  and iv vendors who provide niche management applications  such as managed objects and smarts 
in the future  as we enter new markets  we expect that such markets may have additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  we have become aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space and we expect additional competition from these and other established and emerging companies 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
some of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having management functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the service and business assurance market through strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include management functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is significantly dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such protections may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and 
table of contents trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that we will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
although we believe alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in our product shipments until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see risk factors our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate  or a third party could claim that we are infringing its proprietary rights and we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
employees as of september   we had employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages 
on october   the company announced plans to reduce headcount by approximately during the first quarter of fiscal  from a base of employees as of september  we have also announced changes in our senior management 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to align our employee skills and population with market requirements  including our ability to retain and even attract highly skilled managerial  sales  technical services  customer support and product development personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in retaining and recruiting qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining such personnel 
failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
see risk factors failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business  our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business  and we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
item properties our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in san francisco  under a lease that expires in january our principal product development operations as well as our european headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in london pursuant to a lease that expires in april we also maintain offices in atlanta  chicago  dallas  new york  mclean  virginia  beijing  dubai  dusseldorf  frankfurt  hong kong  madrid  mexico  milan  paris  sao paulo  singapore  sydney  taipei  tokyo  utrecht  vienna and warsaw

overview micromuse inc develops  markets and supports a family of scalable  highly configurable  rapidly deployable software solutions that enable fault management and service assurance the effective monitoring and management of multiple elements underlying an information technology infrastructure  including network devices  computing systems and applications  and the mapping of these elements to the business services they impact 
the company was founded in in london  england  and initially operated a systems integration business  reselling computer hardware and software products and providing consulting services  principally for managing networks 
leveraging our expertise in network management  we developed our netcool omnibus software  which we began shipping in january in march  the company was reorganized in delaware and relocated its headquarters from london to san francisco 
in order to further the growth of the netcool business  we completed an initial public offering of common stock on february  with the proceeds from 
table of contents the financings  we expanded operations and substantially increased development  sales and administrative headcount for the netcool business 
all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool related revenues will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our netcool products and enhancements thereto 
as of september   we had licensed our netcool products to nearly  customers worldwide 
we license our software through our direct sales force  oems and value added resellers 
revenues from oems and resellers combined accounted for approximately  and of our total license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant additional revenue growth in the future will depend substantially on our success in recruiting and training sufficient sales and technical services personnel  maintaining our current distribution relationships and establishing additional relationships with oems  resellers and systems integrators 
as a result of our multinational operations and sales  our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies  particularly the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
for example  while our united states headquarters is located in san francisco  california  our principal product development operations are located in london  england 
as a result  a substantial portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  license  maintenance and service revenues outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
see note geographic and segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from license revenues for our netcool family of products  as well as associated maintenance  consulting and training services revenues 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  maintenance and professional services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement to be based on the renewal 
table of contents price charged to the customer when maintenance is sold separately or the option price for annual maintenance renewals included in the underlying customer contracts 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize revenue for the delivered elements when the basic criteria of sop have been met 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that these elements are delivered 
for all of our software arrangements  we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize revenue for the delivered elements when the basic criteria of sop have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we evaluate each as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists for license arrangements with end users  an arrangement is evidenced by a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
sales to our resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
for certain of our oem arrangements  an arrangement is evidenced on receipt of a delivery notification to the end user 
delivery has occurred delivery is considered to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
in the case of arrangements with resellers and oem s  revenue is recognized upon sell through 
evidence of sell through usually comes in the form of a purchase order or contract identifying the end user and sell through shipping reports  usually identifying the ship to location 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  the company recognizes the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
payments for maintenance fees on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
revenues for professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
deferred revenue includes revenue not yet recognized as a result of deferred maintenance  professional services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all the requirements of sop are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the size of the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on its risk category 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on each day age category 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience by region and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability 
table of contents to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
however  historically the reserve has proven to be adequate 
circumstances that have caused revisions to the allowance calculation have been primarily due to the contraction of the overall economy 
continued deterioration in the economy may result in more customers being placed in the specific account reserve category  thereby increasing our reserve estimate and negatively impacting operating results 
impairment assessments 
we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
significant changes in circumstances can be both internal to our strategic and financial direction  as well as changes to the competitive and economic landscape 
changes in circumstances that are considered important for asset impairment include  but are not limited to  decrease in our market capitalization  contraction of the telecommunications industry  reduction or elimination of geographic economic growth  reductions in our forecasted growth and significant changes to operating costs 
as part of our impairment assessment  we examine economic conditions  products  customer base and geography 
based on these criteria  we determine which products we will continue to support and sell and  thereby  determine which assets will continue to have future strategic value and benefit 
we then estimate the value of the goodwill based on the sum of the expected future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
restructuring related assessments 
as a result of our desire to improve our cost structure and profitability  we announced a restructuring plan in july that reduced our workforce by employees during the fiscal year ended september  in connection with the implementation of the restructuring plan  we incurred million in restructuring costs relating to the reduction in workforce and an additional million in charges related to the planned closing of certain facilities under the restructuring plan 
the remaining accrual as of september  of million consists of million of severance and employment related charges expected to be paid during the year ended september  and million of facility costs expected to be paid on various dates through to determine the facility costs  which is the loss after the company s cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building  certain estimates were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant  sublease terms  and sublease rates  including common area charges 
the lease loss is an estimate and represents the low end of the range 
the company has estimated that if we were unable to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities until expiration of the leases  we would incur a maximum additional amount of approximately million 
in october  as a result of the continued downturn in our targeted market and in an effort to further improve and align cost structure and profitability  we announced another restructuring plan that will reduce our workforce by approximately by december  as a result of this plan  we expect to incur an additional restructuring charge in fiscal pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs and executive recruiting costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases

license revenues were  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in license revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to the economic slowdown that continues to limit the overall capital spending of our existing and potential customers especially the telecommunications market 
the increase in license revenue in fiscal from fiscal was primarily as a result of an increase in the number of product licenses sold and in average transaction size  reflecting the increased acceptance of netcool omnibus  the expansion of our sales organization and the growing sales of netcool internet service monitors  netcool impact  netcool reporter  netcool precision and netcool visionary 
maintenance and service revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in maintenance and service revenue in fiscal from fiscal was mainly as a result of lower services revenue 
the increase in maintenance and services revenue in

revenues from us operations were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues include all revenues other than those from the united states and are based on location of customer 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
to date  our revenues have resulted primarily from sales to the telecommunications industry  including isps 
license revenues from telecommunications industry customers and isps combined accounted for  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
also  one third party distributor  cisco systems  inc  accounted for approximately and of revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
no one third party distributor or end user customer accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal no one end user customer accounted for more than of total revenue for the year ended september   or cost of revenues cost of license revenues consists primarily of technology license fees paid to third party software vendors and the costs of software media  packaging and production 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues were in fiscal and in both fiscal and the increase in fiscal over the prior years was mainly as a result of the company entering into a time based royalty contract for fiscal  in which the royalty cost as a percentage of license revenue increased as license revenue declined 
cost of maintenance and service revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing maintenance  consulting and training to customers 
cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased as a percentage of maintenance and service revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal this improvement was principally due to a proportionally greater percentage of higher margin maintenance revenues as compared to services revenue 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by personnel engaged in sales  technical presales and marketing activities  as well as the costs of trade shows  public relations  marketing materials and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due mainly to the decrease in sales commission as a result of lower revenue and a decrease in personnel related costs as a result of lower headcount and travel expenditure 
however  the increase in fiscal from fiscal reflected the increase in sales commission as a result of increasing revenue and the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the building of our sales force 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses in the coming year will decrease in absolute dollars but will vary as a percentage of revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  exclusive of purchased research and development costs  consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and the costs of computer systems and software development tools 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the decreases in headcount and travel related expenditures but was offset by the write off of the costs of unused software tools and also due to higher costs as a result of the us dollar weakening against the british pound  as 
table of contents our principal product development operations are based in the united kingdom 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to the increased personnel  additional facilities and an increase in the computer systems and software development tools required by the additional personnel 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses in the coming year will decrease in absolute dollars but will vary as a percentage of revenues 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for administration  finance  information systems  legal and human resources  as well as professional fees  other general corporate expenses and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from was primarily due to a lower bad debt expense and a decrease in headcount offset by an increase in professional fees 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to increased staffing  facilities costs and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal and in both fiscal and this percentage increase was primarily due to the decreased scale of operations 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in the coming year will decrease in absolute dollars but will vary as a percentage of revenues 
purchased in process research and development for each of our acquisitions  we allocated part of the purchase price to developed technology and in process research and development ipr d 
this allocation was based on whether or not technological feasibility had been achieved and whether there was an alternative future use for the technology 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  sets guidelines for establishing technological feasibility 
technological feasibility is determined when a product reaches the working model stage  which is generally when a product is classified as a beta version release 
for the acquisitions of calvin alexander networking  inc can in december  netops corporation netops in july and riversoft plc riversoft in august  we concluded that the purchased ipr d of million  million and million  respectively  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use 
therefore  we expensed these costs at the time of the purchase  according to the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of sfas no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets results from the acquisition of can  netops and riversoft 
on december   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of can  a privately held developer of network auto discovery technology  and we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of netops  a privately held developer of diagnostic technology  and we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of riversoft  a publicly held developer of flexible object modeling and root cause analysis technology  and we recorded goodwill of million and other intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal goodwill on the riversoft acquisition was not amortized but instead is to be tested for impairment 
other intangibles were being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of six months to two years 

table of contents amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to our acquisitions of can  netops and riversoft were  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to additional amortization of other intangibles of the newly acquired company  riversoft in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to the effect of a full year s amortization in fiscal as opposed to a partial year in fiscal  as both can and netops were acquired during fiscal restructuring costs during the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million in restructuring costs 
see restructuring related assessment under critical accounting policies and also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
executive recruiting costs the executive recruiting costs million in fiscal were primarily costs incurred in the recruitment of a new chief financial officer 
the costs relate to the fair value of a warrant issued to an executive recruiting firm  fees paid to the recruiting firm and certain relocation costs 
other income  net other income predominately relates to the interest earned from our holdings of cash equivalents and investments 
other income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates in the year 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to increasing cash and investment holdings 
income taxes income taxes were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was mainly as a result of losses in the current year as opposed to income in the prior year 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was as a result of increased income in fiscal from fiscal although we had a loss before income tax  we had a tax expense as we had income in certain tax jurisdictions  which could not be offset against losses in other tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities  acquisitions  capital expenditures and the decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
these outflows of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by net loss adjusted for non cash expenses  the decrease in billed receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  up from million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was due primarily to net income adjusted for non cash expenses  the increase in accrued expenses and deferred revenue  the increase in accounts payable  the maturity of investments and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
these sources of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by capital expenditures  the increase in billed receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets  the purchase of investments and the repurchase of treasury stock in september the increase in accrued expense  deferred revenue  and accounts receivable reflects the growth in the business 

table of contents as of september   the company s principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases 
see note commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
the decision to sell additional equity or debt securities could be made at any time and would likely result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents risk factors the following factors  in addition to the other information contained in this form k  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and our prospects

consequently  forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include  but are not limited to  those discussed below elsewhere in this form k 
readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of the this form k 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of the form k 
our operating results may vary as a result of the current economic slowdown 
we face uncertainty in the degree to which the current economic slowdown will negatively affect growth and capital spending by our existing and potential customers 
we continue to experience increased instances of customers delaying or deferring licenses of our software and maintenance agreement  and longer lead times needed to close our customer sales 
in addition  recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may not be able to accurately anticipate the magnitude of these impacts on future quarterly and annual results 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations 
our quarterly revenues and operating results in geographic segments that we track fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
it is possible that in some quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or financial markets generally  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we realize a significant portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are difficult to forecast because it is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  varies substantially from customer to customer 
further  we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities  and sales and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 

table of contents because of these fluctuations we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of our future performance 
a number of other factors are likely to cause these variations  including changes in the demand for our software products and services and the level of product and price competition that we encounter  the timing of new hires and our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including changes in our sales incentives  the mix of products and services sold  including the mix of sales to new and existing customers and through third party distributors and our direct sales force  changes in the mix of  and lack of demand from  distribution channels through which our products are sold  the length of our sales cycles and the success of our new customer generation activities  spending patterns and budgetary resources of our customers on network management software solutions  product life cycles and the timing of introductions or enhancements of products  or delays in the introductions or enhancements of our products and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products  changes in the renewal rate of maintenance agreements  fluctuations in our gross margins  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of certain assets  liabilities and other items reflected in our financial statements  expansion of international operations  including gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations and the mix of international and domestic revenue  the extent of market consolidation  and software defects and other product quality problems 
therefore  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or others discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business 
over the past few years  we have added customers  personnel and expanded the scope and geographic area of our operations that has placed and will continue to place a significant strain upon our management and our operating and financial systems and resources 
however  we have reduced our headcount from employees on september  to employees on september  as a result of planned reductions and attrition 
on october   the company announced plans to reduce headcount by approximately during the first quarter of fiscal  from a base of employees as of september  given the uncertainties discussed in this risk factors section  together with factors that might affect our ability to quickly expand or contract our work force around the world  it is difficult to predict future requirements for the number and type of employees in the fields and geographies in which we operate 
failure to align employee skills and populations with revenue and market requirements would have a material adverse impact on our business and its operating results 

table of contents our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business 
in the quarter ending september   and also more recently in october  we initiated plans to streamline operations and reduce expenses  which included cuts in discretionary spending  reductions in capital expenditures  reductions in the work force and consolidation of certain office locations  as well as other steps to reduce expenses 
the implementation of our restructuring plans has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial  employee and other resources 
additionally  the restructurings may negatively affect our employee turnover as well as recruiting and retention of important employees 
it is possible that these reductions could impair our marketing  sales and customer support efforts or alter our product development plans 
if we experience difficulties in carrying out the restructuring plans  our expenses could increase more quickly than we expect 
if we find that our planned restructurings do not achieve our objectives  it may be necessary to implement further reduction of our expenses  to perform additional reductions in our headcount  or to undertake additional restructurings of our business 
we may fail to support our operations 
to succeed in the implementation of our business strategy  we must execute our sales strategy and further develop products and expand service capabilities  while managing future operations by implementing effective planning and operating processes 
if we fail to manage effectively  our business could suffer 
to manage  we must successfully manage the business with fewer employees due to the restructuring plans  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire  train and retain qualified personnel  especially if the business climate improves  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies  effectively manage multiple relationships with various oem s  resellers and system integrators  and successfully integrate the businesses of our acquired companies 
we need to continue to expand our distribution channels and retain our existing third party distributors 
we need to continue to develop relationships with leading network equipment and telecommunications providers and to expand our third party channels of distribution through oems  resellers and systems integrators 
we currently invest significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution  which could reduce our ability to generate profits 
third party distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our business will be harmed if we are not able to retain and attract additional distributors that market our products effectively 
further  many of our agreements with third party distributors are nonexclusive  and many of the companies with which we have agreements also have similar agreements with our competitors or potential competitors 
our third party distributors have significantly greater sales and marketing resources than we do  and their sales and marketing efforts may conflict with our direct sales efforts 
in addition  although sales through third party distributors result in reduced sales and marketing expense with respect to such sales  we sell our products to third party distributors at reduced prices  resulting in lower gross margins on such third party sales 
we believe that our success in penetrating markets for our fault and service level management applications depends substantially on our ability to maintain our current distribution relationships  in particular  those with cisco systems  ibm  ericsson  unisphere siemens  sun microsystems and others 
our business will be harmed if network equipment and telecommunications providers and distributors discontinue their relationships with us  compete directly with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors 
we are dependent on the market for software designed for use with advanced communications services  and the size of this market is unproven 
the market for our products is in an early stage of development or is developed but not highly penetrated 
although the rapid expansion and increasing complexity of computer networks in recent years and the resulting 
table of contents emergence of service level agreements has increased  the demand for fault and service level management software products  the awareness of and the need for such products is a recent development 
therefore  it is difficult to assess the size of this market  the appropriate features and prices for products to address this market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
we are substantially dependent upon telecommunications carriers and other service providers continuing to purchase our products 
telecommunications carriers  including internet service providers  that deliver advanced communications services to their customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  these providers are an important focus of our sales strategy 
if these customers cease to deploy advanced communications services for any reason  the market for our products will be harmed 
also  delays in the introduction of advanced services or the failure of such services to gain widespread market acceptance or the decision of telecommunications carriers and other service providers not to use our products in the deployment of these services would harm our business 
consolidations in  or a continued slowdown in  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant growth and consolidation in the past few years  although over the recent year trends indicate that capital spending by this industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
our business is highly dependent on the telecommunications industry and on continued capital spending by our customers in that industry 
in the event of further significant slowdown in capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
we cannot be certain that consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunication industry will not harm our business 
our business depends on the continued growth in use and improvement of the internet 
a significant portion of our revenues comes from telecommunications carriers  internet service providers and other customers that rely upon or are driven by the internet 
as a result  our future results of operations substantially depend on the continued acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication 
our business could be harmed if this growth does not continue or if the rate of technological innovation  deployment or use of the internet slows or declines 
recent data and reports indicate that both the growth of significant portions of the internet and technological innovations have slowed 
if these trends continue  they will likely have an adverse impact on our business 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for internet based services may prompt the introduction of new laws and regulations 
laws  which impose additional burdens on those companies that conduct business online  could decrease the expansion of the use of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business  which could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we face intense competition  including from larger competitors with greater resources than our own  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in gross margins 
we face intense competition in our markets 
as we enter new markets  we encounter additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because the software market has relatively low barriers to entry  we are aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions and may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share 

table of contents further  many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the fault and service level management market by strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the fault and service level and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories customer s internal design and development organizations that produce service level management and network management applications for their particular needs  in some cases using multiple instances of products from hardware and software vendors such as compaq  hewlett packard company and cabletron systems  inc  vendors of network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc  vendors of network and systems management applications including hewlett packard company and bmc software  inc  providers of specific market applications  and systems integrators serving the telecommunications industry which primarily provide programming services to develop customer specific applications including tcsi corporation  tti and agilent technologies  inc many of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 
if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed  and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
complex software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
because of defects  we could continue to experience delays in or failure of market acceptance of products  or damage to our reputation or relationships with our customers 
any defects and errors in new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments would harm our business 
in addition  because our products are used to monitor and address network problems and avoid failures of the network to support critical business functions  any design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from network elements or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
further  although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the liability and costs associated therewith 

table of contents the sales cycle for our software products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
the sales cycle is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the software requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of our software 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our software is generally used for division wide or enterprise wide  business critical purposes and involves significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and requires us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
licensing of our software products often requires an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to license such software generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
on december   the company announced that mr 
brown is resigning as chairman and chief executive officer effective december   to assume a position as executive vice president of motorola  inc and president and ceo of motorola s communications  government and industrial solutions sector 
michael l 
luetkemeyer  senior vice president and chief financial officer  has been appointed chief executive officer of micromuse on an interim basis effective january   and will retain his responsibilities as chief financial officer 
the company s board of directors anticipates undertaking a search for the chief executive officer position in early  and the company has previously stated in its public conference call on december   that mr 
luetkemeyer is expected to be a potential candidate for that position 
on september   katrinka mccallum resigned her position as chief operating officer 
the company does not currently intend to appoint an individual to fill that position 
our success is substantially dependent upon a limited number of key management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key employees could harm our business 
we do not generally have employment contracts with key personnel 
in addition  we are dependent upon our continuing ability to attract  train and retain additional highly qualified management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
also  the volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees  who often expect to realize value from stock options 
because we face intense competition in our recruiting activities  we may be unable to attract and or retain qualified personnel 
mr 
brown s resignation creates uncertainties attendant to the search process for a non interim chief executive officer  including the length of time that may be needed for that purpose  whether our board of directors will ultimately select our interim chief executive officer or another candidate for that position  our ability to attract and employ on acceptable terms an individual who will successfully follow mr 
brown  and the ability of our continuing management team and ultimate chief executive officer to maintain continuity with our existing customers  manage our employees  and execute our ongoing and future business strategies 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
in august  we completed the 
table of contents acquisition of riversoft plc  a developer of flexible object modeling and root cause analysis software 
because of this acquisition  we are integrating distinct products  customers and corporate cultures into our own 
these past and potential future acquisitions create numerous risks for us  including failure to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of our management s attention from other matters  loss of key employees of acquired companies  substantial transaction costs  substantial liabilities or exposures in the acquired entity that were not known or accurately evaluated or forecast by us  and substantial additional costs charged to operations as a result of the failure to consummate a potential acquisition 
further  some of the products we acquire would require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at levels we anticipate 
moreover  our future acquisitions  if any  may result in issuances of our equity securities which dilute our stockholders  the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization and impairment expense 
it is possible that our efforts to consummate or integrate acquisitions will not be successful  which would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of products for a significant portion of our revenues 
all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool omnibus related revenues will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenues beyond fiscal and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
although we have netcool omnibus for voice networks  netcool precision  netcool visionary and other products  our future operating results  particularly in the near term  are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of netcool omnibus  improvements to netcool omnibus and new and enhanced netcool omnibus applications 
our business will be harmed if netcool omnibus does not continue to achieve market acceptance or if we fail to develop and market improvements to netcool omnibus or new or enhanced products 
the life cycles of netcool omnibus  including the netcool omnibus applications  are difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent emergence of many of our markets  the effect of future product enhancements and competition 
a decline in the demand for netcool omnibus as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period from a limited number of customers 
see concentration of credit risk in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
if a significant customer  or group of customers  cancels or delays orders for our products  or does not continue to purchase our products at or above historical levels  our business will be harmed 
for example  pre existing customers may be part of  or become part of  large organizations that standardize using a competitive product 
the terms of our agreements with our customers typically contain a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of maintenance fees 
the maintenance agreement is renewable annually at the option of the customer and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  we generally do not have long term customer contracts upon which we can rely for future revenues 

table of contents our business is subject to risks from global operations and we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we license our products in foreign countries 
in addition  we maintain a significant portion of our operations  including the bulk of our software development operations  in the united kingdom 
fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the united states dollar have adversely impacted our results in the past and may do so in the future 
see note geographic and segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning revenues outside the united states 
we expect that international license  maintenance and consulting revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies and do not currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
our international operations and revenues involve a number of other inherent risks  including longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulty in staffing and generally higher costs associated with managing foreign operations  an even lengthier sales cycle than with domestic customers  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world generally are adversely affected in the quarter ending september  as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
if our international sales become a greater component of total revenue  these seasonal factors may have a more pronounced effect on our operating results  changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and tariffs and other trade barriers  changes in or failure to be aware of or to account for payroll  stock option  employee stock purchase and business related taxation  political  economic or terrorism induced instability  lack of acceptance of non localized products  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  and immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy our employees 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states 
such expansion will require significant management attention and expenditure of significant financial resources and could adversely affect our ability to generate profits 
if we are unable to establish additional foreign operations in a timely manner  our growth in international sales will be limited  and our business could be harmed 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate and we must constantly develop  market and sell new and enhanced products 
if we fail to do so  our business will be harmed 
for example  the widespread adoption of new architecture standards for managing telecommunications networks would force us to adapt our products to such standard  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
further  the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors may cause our customers to defer licensing of our existing products 

table of contents our products operate on third party software platforms  and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products operate on third party software platforms and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms employed by our customers in their networks 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by systems vendors  particularly sun microsystems  inc  international business machines corporation  hewlett packard company  cabletron systems  inc and cisco systems  inc and by vendors of relational database software  particularly oracle corporation and sybase  inc  could harm our business 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate  or a third party could claim that we are infringing its proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  patents  trademarks or other proprietary information or intellectual property  our business could be harmed 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so as our international operations expand  the risk that we will fail to adequately protect our intellectual property increases 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  other parties may assert that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights or we have not fulfilled the terms of agreements with them 
any such claims  with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty  licensing or other agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by us until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
our stock price is volatile  exposing us to possible risks of costly and time consuming securities class action litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  
table of contents developments with respect to intellectual property rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired such that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable  and we may be required to record an impairment charge impacting our financial position 
as of september   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which relate to the acquisitions of can  netops and riversoft 
the company regularly performs reviews to determine if the carrying value of assets is impaired 
as part of our impairment assessment  we examine economic conditions  products  customer base and geography 
based on these criteria  we determine which products we will continue to support and sell and  thereby  determine which assets will continue to have future strategic value and benefit 
no such impairment has been indicated to date 
asset impairment charges of this nature could be large and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and reported results of operations 
future sales of our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock 
as of september   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  excluding approximately million shares subject to options outstanding as of such date under our stock option plans that are exercisable at prices ranging from approximately to per share 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options  or the perception such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for common stock 
in addition  tax charges resulting from the exercise of stock options could adversely affect the reported results of operations 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a change in control of micromuse that a stockholder may consider favorable 
the provisions include blank check preferred stock that could be used by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  and a classified board of directors with staggered  two year  terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors in addition  section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which is applicable to us  and our stock incentive plans  may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of micromuse 
changes in effective tax rates could affect our results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 

table of contents our business is especially subject to the risks of earthquakes  floods and other natural catastrophic events  and to interruption by manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism 
our corporate headquarters are located in san francisco  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc on september  disrupted commerce throughout the world and intensified the uncertainty of the us and other economies 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to these economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenues and operating expenses in the uk however  as of september   no hedging contracts were outstanding 
we operate internationally and thus are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on receivables  payables and intercompany balances denominated in a nonfunctional currency 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with the gains and losses of the foreign exchange forward contracts 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through earnings in the period of change in their fair value 
fixed income investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with less than three months to maturity at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less are considered cash equivalents  investments with maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments  investments with maturities in excess of twelve months are considered to be long term investments 
the weighted average pre tax interest rate on the investment portfolio is approximately
