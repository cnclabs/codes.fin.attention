see the financial services operation section herein for additional detail 
with the discontinuance of the property and casualty insurance operation during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized net income of million from these operations for the period in prior to their classification as a discontinued operation 
the discontinued insurance operations are accounted for using the liquidation basis of accounting as prescribed under apb opinion no 
as no loss is expected in the future under liquidation accounting from the run off of the property and casualty insurance operation  no loss was reported for the discontinuance of this business 
any gain from 
table of contents discontinued insurance operations will be recognized only when fully realized 
using an effective discount rate that is less than the discount rate of being utilized for statutory purposes see item business discontinued insurance operations property and casualty insurance and claim and expense payment patterns established through actuarial analysis as of december   the present value of the loss and lae reserves are estimated to be less than the present value of the dedicated assets supporting them 
the company believes that the loss and lae reserves of the discontinued insurance operations are adequate  on a discounted basis  as of december   and that the assets of these operations  and all related future cash inflows  will be adequate to fund all future policy obligations 
the substantial net loss for the year ended december  for the discontinued insurance operations is predominantly the result of the recognition of an increase of million in the gross liability for loss and lae reserves during the quarter ended june   and the recognition of million in certain charges during the quarter ended december  associated with the restructuring of the workers compensation insurance operation  which was announced on december  the discontinued insurance operations net loss for the year ended december  was due primarily to the impact of two actions 
first  in the third quarter of  a charge in the amount of million was recognized on a pre tax basis  for the adverse effect on incurred loss and lae of a lower than expected level of certain reinsurance recoverables than had been actuarially predicted at the inception of certain reinsurance agreements 
second  the recognition of a settlement agreement with reliance insurance company reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december   which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
in addition  during  a million pre tax charge was incurred for an observed increase in reported asbestos and environmental claims in excess of previous estimates in its discontinued assumed treaty and facultative reinsurance operation 
the aforementioned increase in gross loss and lae reserves  restructuring charges and reinsurance actions  are explained in more detail in the discontinued insurance operations section herein 
unallocated corporate interest and other expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of investment income revenue  offset by unallocated corporate expenses consisting primarily of interest expense  net of any affiliate interest income  and general and administrative expenses  net of subsidiary reimbursement 
the unallocated corporate interest and other expense loss before taxes for the year ended december   was million as compared to million and million  for and  respectively 
the increase in  as compared to  is due primarily to decreased revenues at fremont 
management fees comprised of the allocation of certain costs incurred by fremont for the rendering of various services to its subsidiaries  substantially all from fremont comp  decreased approximately million  as the size of the workers compensation insurance operation was reduced and  under the agreement of november  with the doi  a significant amount of these fees were deferred  and not recognized by fremont as income due to the uncertainty of their ultimate collection 
fremont has historically not charged applicable management fees in any significant amount to fgcc 
lower interest rates on investments at fremont resulted in investment income declining million in from as discussed further in this paragraph  there was no affiliate interest income in  compared to million in this was offset by reductions of million in interest expense due to the reduced level of principal outstanding under the senior notes and million in other corporate expenses 
the significant increase in as compared to is due primarily to lower affiliate interest income from the downstream holding company subsidiaries 
the lower affiliate interest income resulted from the conversions on january  and april  of approximately million and million  respectively  in notes receivable due from these subsidiaries to common equity in the subsidiaries  thereby establishing capital contributions to them 
the january  conversion transaction affected fgcc  the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the industrial bank subsidiary 
the april  conversion transaction impacted fremont comp  which is the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the discontinued insurance subsidiaries 
with these debt conversions  beginning january   and to a larger extent april   the unallocated corporate interest expense is  and will continue to be  higher 

table of contents after these conversions  there is no affiliate debt due from the downstream holding company subsidiaries 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
during the year ended december   fremont extinguished million and million  respectively  in principal amount of its publicly traded senior notes due and senior notes due senior notes  which were originally issued by fremont pursuant to an exchange offer in the second quarter of during the year ended december   fremont extinguished million and million  respectively  in principal amount of its publicly traded senior notes due and senior notes due in addition  during  fremont extinguished million of principal amount at maturity of its publicly traded liquid yield option notes due the lyons 
after tax gains of million and million  respectively  were recognized from these actions during and the after tax gain is reported as an extraordinary item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income tax expense of million  million and million for  and  represents effective tax rates of   and  respectively  on income before taxes from continuing operations 
the effective tax rates for the three periods presented are different than the federal enacted tax rate of  due mainly to higher state income tax provisions within the financial services operation  and  to a lesser extent  tax exempt goodwill amortization  which is excluded from deductible expenses 
the significant change in effective tax rates in  as compared to and  is a result of a decision to increase by million an accrual for certain pending state tax issues 
in  million of the accrued amount was reversed as a result of the expected favorable resolution of certain of these matters

the primary factors related to the increase in earnings in is as follows net interest income increased to million in from million in on an increase in net interest earning assets 
net interest earning assets averaged billion in  up from an average of billion in net interest income  as a percentage of average net interest earning assets  decreased slightly in to from in the primary 
table of contents reason for the increase in the average net interest earning assets for was a increase in the average balance of commercial real estate loans in the portfolio 
net gains on the sales of residential real estate loans increased significantly from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in the amount of loans sold  an increase in the prices realized on the sale of these loans  and a slight decrease in the allocable cost of the loans sold 
loans sold in totaled billion  up from billion in this is reflective of an increase in total residential real estate loans originated 
during  billion in residential real estate loans were originated  as compared to billion in loans held for sale also increased from million at december  to million at december  the gross premium on loan sales during was  up from in this is reflective of improved market conditions and acceptability of the loans originated by the company 
lower net operating expense levels as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
this percentage was in  as compared to in this reflects the implementation in and of various cost reduction programs and various operating efficiencies associated with increased volumes of loan originations and outstandings 
the increase in earnings in was offset by significantly increased provisions for loan losses 
the provision for totaled million  up from million in the increase in the provision is due in part to an increase in the loan portfolio outstanding from billion at december  to billion at december   but is primarily due to the company increasing its allowance for loan losses in response to its evaluation of expected  and often uncertain  future trends in general economic conditions and their impact upon the commercial real estate market in particular 
non accrual loans in the loan portfolio increased during  however loan losses  except for the syndicated commercial loan portfolio  remained relatively consistent at million for and million for loan charge offs totaled million in for the syndicated loan portfolio  as compared to no charge offs in the net charge offs from the syndicated loan portfolio occurred primarily from the company s decision to significantly downsize this business during and from the effect of economic conditions in on this portfolio 
the financial services operation s income before taxes was million for the year this is a increase when compared to s income before taxes  excluding the gain on the sale of fremont financial and its million in income before taxes for this increase in earnings is a result of the following net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets increased to for as compared to for this increase reflects improved pricing for the various lending products  lower relative costs of funding and a more favorable mix of higher yielding lending products 
increased levels of net gains recognized on residential real estate whole loan sales 
lower net operating expense levels as a percentage of average earning assets 
this percentage was in  as compared to in net charge offs  as a percentage of the average loan portfolio  were only  resulting in a lower provision for loan losses in than in

the net interest margin as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased to for  as compared to for the slight decrease for is due primarily to the effect of an increase in non interest accruing loans and the differential between the repricing of variable rate loans receivable and the deposits which fund the loans when interest rates were declining during the margin between interest income and expense increased in as compared to due mainly to the combined effect of an increase in the net yields on commercial real estate loans  and to a lesser degree  increases in net yields on syndicated commercial loans 
the net yields on residential real estate loans decreased slightly 
as indicated in the table above  the average outstandings of commercial real estate loans increased by in and created a significant positive impact on the overall net interest income margin

as of december   non accrual commercial real estate loans and reo had increased to million and million  respectively  from million and million  respectively at december  these balances were comprised of thirteen non accrual commercial real estate loans and three reo properties at december  as compared to eleven non accrual commercial real estate loans and two reo properties at december  consideration must be given that  due to the secured nature of the company s loans and the presence of larger balance loans  the classification  and the timing thereof  of an individual loan as non performing or reo can have a significant impact upon the level of total non performing assets  without necessarily a commensurate increase in loss exposure 
the increase in non performing assets from december  to december  is due to a few loans being either classified as non accrual and becoming reo through foreclosure for example  at december  there was no commercial reo  as compared to two reo properties at december  with a balance of million 
as of december   non accrual residential real estate loans including loans held for sale and reo had decreased to million and million  respectively  from million and million  respectively at december  the decrease in non accrual loans is primarily the result of a concerted effort by the company to reduce these non performing assets through sales to other financial institutions 
the increase in residential real estate non performing loans from december  to december   was primarily attributable to increased levels of loan originations and general trends for sub prime loans 
the syndicated loan group had no loans in non performing status at december   and only one each at december  and  with balances of million and million  respectively  at december  and see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on non performing assets

whole loan sales are cash transactions made without recourse to the company or its subsidiaries 
no net gain on sale was recognized on the residual interests retained from the three securitizations in discontinued insurance operations the property and casualty insurance operation  which was primarily represented by the underwriting of workers compensation insurance policies  was classified as discontinued during the fourth quarter of the intention is to allow the liabilities primarily loss and lae reserves related to the discontinued insurance business to run off and the company estimates that the dedicated assets primarily cash  investment securities  and reinsurance recoverables supporting these operations  and all related future cash inflows  will be adequate to fund all future policy obligations 
as a result  the property and casualty insurance operation is accounted for as a discontinued operation using the liquidation basis of accounting and  accordingly  the company s operating results have been restated to reflect reporting in this manner for all periods presented 
for additional detail on the discontinuance of the property and casualty insurance operation see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the property and casualty insurance operation segment posted net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements for results of operations from discontinued insurance operations 
special discussion concerning the loss and lae reserve increases in in the second quarter of  the company increased its gross loss and lae reserves under workers compensation insurance policies effective in or prior to by million 
the reserve action was determined through an evaluation of several factors  including increased severity trends observed since december  relating to the and prior accident years  increased variability of actuarial indications  and increased uncertainty within the workers compensation industry as to the underlying causes and consequent ultimate impact of both increases in claim severity and an acceleration in the payment of claims 
the adequacy of these provisions for loss and lae incurred for the accident year were evaluated by taking into consideration the actuarial indications as of december   the severity development potential for reinsurance recoveries  assumptions regarding changes in the development pattern of claims incurred on the accident year  as well as other factors 
with respect to the million total loss and lae reserve increase in the second quarter of  million related to loss and directly allocated lae alae  with the remaining reserve increase 
table of contents of million relating to that portion of the company s gross lae reserves that provide for the unallocated general and administrative costs of settling estimated claims and which are not allocated to specific claims ulae 
special discussion concerning reinsurance transactions and reserve adjustments recognized in the net loss from discontinued insurance operations in resulted primarily from the combined adverse effect on incurred loss and lae of a lower than expected level of reinsurance recoverables than had been actuarially predicted at inception  coupled with the recognition of the settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  with regard to the lower than expected reinsurance recoverables  which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of  the company lowered its estimate of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses for the and accident years by approximately million 
this decrease was in recognition of a lower than actuarially predicted level of incurred losses ceded under certain reinsurance contracts that were in effect from january  through december  these reinsurance contracts reduced the company s net loss exposure from a historical retention of million per loss occurrence to  per loss occurrence 
also contributing to the loss before taxes in the fourth quarter of was the recognition of million in lower reinsurance recoverables on the and accident years pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on february  between the company and reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  under the settlement agreement  the company received approximately million in cash and no longer has any involvement with the reliance workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the million decrease in reinsurance recoverables represented the adjustment necessary to bring the estimated reinsurance recoverables relating to the and accident years under the reinsurance contract with reliance to a present value basis at december  market risk the company is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
changes in interest rates can affect net investment income  loan interest income  gains or losses on loan sales  interest expense and total stockholders equity 
the objective of the asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest and investment income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
no derivative financial instruments were owned at december  and  consequently  the company is not subject to market risk for such off balance sheet financial instruments 
furthermore  there is no exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
financial services operation interest rate risk the financial services operation is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans receivable and loans held for sale and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance its loans such as thrift deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  it does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives

during  the company securitized certain of its residential real estate loans 
a securitization has the effect of reducing interest rate risk since the securitized loans are typically removed from the balance sheet 
however  a residual interest is retained in the securitized loans  and this residual interest is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value million at december  
residual interests do not have a stated maturity or amortization period and the expected amount of the net cash flow  as well as the timing of such cash flow  depends on the performance of the underlying collateral supporting each securitization

critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to investments  income taxes  loan and insurance loss reserves  and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  
table of contents economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable loan losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
income taxes the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income 
management s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  loan loss experience  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
discontinued insurance operations discontinued insurance operations are accounted for using the liquidation basis of accounting whereby all future cash inflows and outflows are considered in determining whether the dedicated assets are sufficient to meet all future obligations 
the adequacy of the dedicated assets are determined by i estimating the ultimate remaining liabilities  ii discounting these liabilities using estimates of payment patterns and investment yields derived from the dedicated investment portfolio  and iii comparing and limiting this discounted estimate of liabilities to the dedicated assets 
any gains from discontinued insurance operations would be recorded only at such time as their realization is certain 
if  due to economic conditions or other various factors  management concludes that the dedicated assets supporting these operations  and all related cash inflows  are not adequate to fund future policy obligations  then management would record a loss on discontinued insurance operations at that time
