the following is a discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
general our principal business objective is to generate income for distribution to our unitholders from the transportation of natural gas through our gathering systems 
we completed an initial public offering of our common units in february and used the proceeds of that offering to acquire the gathering systems formerly owned by atlas america  inc and its affiliates  all subsidiaries of resource america 
the acquisition agreement provided that operations of the gathering systems from and after january  would be for our account and  accordingly  we deem january  to be the commencement of our operations 
the gathering systems gather natural gas from wells in eastern ohio  western new york  and western pennsylvania and transport the natural gas primarily to public utility pipelines 
to a lesser extent  the gathering systems transport natural gas to end users 
the results of operations discussed below are for the year ended december  and the period ended december  in january  we acquired the gas gathering system of kingston oil corporation 
the gas gathering system consists of approximately miles of pipeline located in southeastern ohio 
the purchase price consisted of  of cash and  common units valued at per unit 
in march  we acquired the gas gathering system of american refining and exploration company 
the gas gathering system consists of approximately miles of pipeline located in fayette county  pennsylvania 
the purchase price consisted of  of cash and  common units valued at per unit 
we drew on our million line of credit in order to make both cash payments 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly we allocated the purchase prices to the assets acquired based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
following the end of fiscal  on january  we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the equity interests in triton from new vulcan coal holdings and vulcan intermediary 
the vulcan entities will contribute of the equity interests in triton and million in cash to us in exchange for  common units   newly created subordinated units and  newly created deferred participation units 
the deferred participation units will convert into subordinated units only if our combined operations meet specified target levels for distributions and available cash from operations 
in addition  new vulcan coal holdings will acquire our general partner 
triton is a coal mining company that owns and operates two large  union free surface coal mines located in the southern powder river basin near gillette  wyoming that produce environmentally compliant  sub bituminous coal for use by electric utilities 
triton is one of the ten largest domestic producers of coal in total tons produced 
upon the closing of the triton acquisition  we will make a special  one time distribution of per common unit to holders of common units as of the date of the special meeting of unitholders called to approve the acquisition 
in addition  the  outstanding subordinated units held by our general partner will be transferred to resource america and will convert into  common units 
as a result of these transactions  the vulcan entities will own approximately of our outstanding common units  approximately of our outstanding common and subordinated units in the aggregate  and approximately of our common and subordinated units in the aggregate if all deferred participation units convert into subordinated units 
as conditions to the completion of the triton acquisition  we will also o amend and restate our limited partnership agreement and the limited partnership agreement of our operating subsidiary  atlas pipeline operating partnership  o amend  restate and consolidate our master natural gas gathering agreement and omnibus agreement with atlas america  which will allow atlas america to continue to operate our pipeline systems and include a new commitment from resource america and atlas america to drill and connect wells to our gathering systems  o terminate our distribution support agreement with our general partner  and o enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the common units we will issue to the vulcan entities and resource america 
we will need the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding common units and outstanding subordinated units  each voting separately as a class  to approve the triton acquisition 
our general partner holds all of our outstanding subordinated units and has agreed to vote all of them in favor of the proposal 
accordingly  the class vote for the subordinated units approving the triton acquisition is assured 
we filed a preliminary proxy statement  which describes the triton acquisition  with the securities and exchange commission on february  results of operations our income for the year ended december   other than interest income  was transportation and compression revenue 
two variables which affect our transportation and compression revenues are o the volumes of natural gas transported by us  which are in turn a function of the demand for natural gas in the regions served by our gathering systems  and o the transportation fees paid to us 
the following table sets forth the average volumes transported  average transportation rates and revenues received by us for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  average daily throughput volumes in mcf   average transportation rate per mcf 

total transportation and compression revenues   year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our transportation and compression revenue increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  the increase of  resulted from an increase in both the volumes of natural gas we transported and an increase in the average transportation fees paid to us 
our average daily throughput volumes were  mcfs in the year ended december  as compared to  mcfs in the year ended december   an increase of  mcfs 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume resulted principally from volumes associated with pipelines acquired during the three months ended march  and new wells added to our pipeline system  wells were turned on line in the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes inherent in the life of a well 
our transportation rates are primarily at fixed percentages of the sales price of natural gas transported 
our transportation rates for natural gas produced by atlas america and its affiliates also have specified minimums 
our average transportation rate was 
per mcf in the year ended december  as compared to 
per mcf in the year ended december   an increase of 
per mcf 
the increase in our average transportation rate resulted from the increase in the average natural gas price received by producers for gas transported through our pipeline system 
transportation rates had increased significantly during the year  but had fallen back to an average of 
per mcf for the month ended december  interest income of  consists of interest earned on funds temporarily invested in short term money market accounts  an increase of  from  for the year ended december  costs and expenses 
our transportation and compression expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
our average cost per mcf of transportation and compression was 
in the year ended december  as compared to 
in the year ended december   an increase of 

this increase primarily resulted from an increase in compressor expenses  including lease payments  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due to upgrades and additions  and increased costs approximating  associated with operating pipelines acquired in the three months ended march  our general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase primarily resulted from an increase in allocated compensation and benefits  and legal and professional fees  due to the increased level of activity associated with acquisitions  and an increase in our insurance  reflecting an increase in our operating activities and assets and the insurance market 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  
this increase resulted from the increased depreciation associated with pipeline extensions and acquisitions 
our interest expense increased to  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  this increase of  resulted from borrowings on our credit facility in january and march of to fund two acquisitions and an additional draw in june to fund capital expenditures associated with pipeline extensions 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  subordinated unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements through borrowings under our credit facilities or through contributions from our general partner pursuant to the distribution support agreement 
the following table summarizes our financial condition at december  and december  current ratio to to working capital in thousands   ratio of long term debt to total partners capital 
to n a during  net cash provided by operations of  was derived principally from  of income from operations before depreciation and amortization 
this increase of  in cash provided by operations from fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in income from operations before depreciation and amortization of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities of  the increase in cash flow provided by operations was principally due to and increase in transportation revenue of  due to an increase in both the volumes transported by us and the average price per mcf received by us in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in revenue was partially offset by increases of  in transportation and general and administrative expenses due to an increase in our operating activities 
the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses in the prior year of  which represents two months of transportation fees  was a result of fiscal being our initial year of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was  a decrease of  from cash used in investing activities in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during consisted of the acquisition of two small pipelines from third parties  and capital expenditures associated with extensions and compression upgrades to our existing pipeline systems 
in the prior year  we used  for the initial acquisition of our gathering system 
net cash used in financing activities was  a change of  from cash provided by financing activities of  in the prior year 
distributions paid to partners during amounted to  an increase of  over the year ended december  net borrowings of  were used to acquire two gas gathering systems and fund pipeline extensions 
in the prior year  we had received proceeds from our initial public offering of  commitments through december   we have incurred costs of approximately  and estimate that total costs associated with the triton acquisition  for which we will be responsible if the transaction does not close  will ultimately exceed million 
we would then have the right to seek reimbursement of up to million from the vulcan entities if triton had not obtained the million of financing that is a condition of closing 
our obligation to pay any remaining un reimbursed costs could adversely affect our ability to pay future minimum quarterly distributions 
if the transaction closes  we expect to use the triton financing to pay the transaction costs  which we estimate will be million 
debt obligations and credit facilities we entered into million revolving credit facility in october for a description of the terms of this facility  you should read note to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal purpose in obtaining the facility was to help fund the expansion of out existing gathering systems and the acquisitions of other gas gathering systems 
in the year ended december   we used million of the facility to fund  in part  the acquisitions of two gas gathering systems and  of the facility to fund capital expenditures for expansions of our existing gathering systems 
at december    was outstanding on this facility 
capital expenditures our property and equipment was approximately and of our total consolidated assets at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  other than for the initial acquisition of the gathering system in  and the acquisitions of two pipelines in  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures principally consisted of costs relating to expansion of our existing gathering systems as a result of new wells connected to our system and compressor upgrades 
we anticipate capital expenditures for of million for further expansion of our gathering systems  including approximately million for a major trunk system expansion in fayette county  pennsylvania  and upgrading of our compressor facilities 
these capital expenditures will be funded by a combination of cash generated from operations and from our existing line of credit 
as of december   however  we did not have any specific commitments to make any capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures could increase materially from our estimate if the number of wells connected to our gathering systems in fiscal exceeds our current estimate 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the operating expenses of the gathering systems 
increases in those expenses are not necessarily offset by increases in transportation rates that the gathering operations are able to charge 
we have not been materially affected by inflation because we were formed relatively recently and have only a limited period of operations 
while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs  we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects 
in addition  the value of the gathering systems has been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations which we are unable to control or accurately predict 
environmental regulation a continuing trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has generally resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry 
we monitor environmental and safety laws and we believe are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  however  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we believe  however  that environmental and safety costs will increase in the future 
we cannot assure you that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase combination completed after june will not be amortized  but will be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate existing accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july will continue to be amortized until we adopt sfas  which is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the impact of adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the date of adoption  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was  for the year ended december  sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets was issued  addressing financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
implementation will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect o the amount we report for assets and liabilities  o our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and o the amounts we report for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular position circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  provisions for uncollectable accounts receivable  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have exposure to currency exchange risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions  and as a result  we do not have exposure to derivatives risk 
market risk inherent in our debt is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates 
changes in variable rate debt usually do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we have a million revolving credit facility to fund the expansion of our existing gathering systems and the acquisition of other gas gathering systems 
the carrying value of our debt was approximately million at december  at our option  the facility bears interest at either the lending institution s prime rate plus basis points or the euro rate  which is defined as an average of specified london interbank offered rates libor plus or basis points  depending upon atlas leverage ratio 
at december   the weighted average interest rate was 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately  in our net income and would not affect the market value of this debt
