item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  our financial statements and the notes thereto  which are found elsewhere in this form k  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and operation of oil and gas properties onshore and in shallow waters of the gulf of mexico and in several basins in the rocky mountains 
we have been active in the gulf coast basin since  which gives us extensive geophysical  technical and operational expertise in this area 
our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas 
over the last few years  the prices of oil and gas have been highly volatile 
the increased volatility was attributable to a variety of factors impacting supply and demand  including seasonal  political and economic events we can neither control nor predict 
oil and gas prices generally peaked at the beginning of and generally declined throughout the remainder of the year 
our realized gas equivalent price for the fourth quarter of was less than our realized gas equivalent price in the first quarter of historically  the cost to acquire oil and gas properties moves in relation to the prices of oil and gas 
when prices began to fall in early  we set out to acquire a package of properties that fit our strategic characteristics 
over the last several years  we have financed our capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
by not burdening our capital structure with a high percentage of debt  we were able to access the credit markets to quickly complete the million conoco property acquisition on december  our capital expenditures budget is currently approximately million  or less than s capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
the decline in estimated capital investment is due to our outlook on oil and gas prices and our intent to once again finance our capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
the decline in drilling and operating costs and services should enable us to evaluate wells at a much lower cost than in to the extent that cash flow from operations exceed our estimated capital expenditures  we plan to pay down a portion of our existing debt 
in the event that cash flow from operations during is not sufficient to fund estimated capital expenditures  we believe that our bank credit facility  under which we have million of available borrowings at march   will provide us with adequate liquidity 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations and summary information with respect to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves

compared to for the year  we reported a net loss totaling million  or per share  compared to net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
the variance in annual results was due to the following components production 
during  production volumes totaled bcfe compared to bcfe produced during natural gas production during decreased to approximately billion cubic feet compared to gas production of billion cubic feet  while oil production during totaled approximately million barrels compared to million barrels produced during the decrease in production rates  compared to  was the combined result of our drilling program providing less than expected production growth and normal production declines 
prices 
prices realized during averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas compared to average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
all unit pricing amounts include the cash effects of hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
hedging transactions increased the average price we received during for oil by per barrel and decreased the average price received for natural gas by per mcf  compared to net decreases of per barrel and per mcf realized during oil and gas revenue 
as a result of higher realized prices on a mcfe basis  oil and gas revenues increased to million in from million during expenses 
normal operating costs during increased to million  compared to million during on a unit of production basis  operating costs were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in operating costs was due primarily to industry wide increases in the costs of oil field products and services 
production tax expense for decreased to million from million in primarily due to decreased production volumes from onshore properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on our oil and gas properties totaled million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe  for higher drilling costs  higher unit reserve replacement costs and declining oil and gas prices used in computing amortization under the future gross revenue method contributed to the increased dd a expense during we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
based upon low oil and gas prices at the end of the third quarter of  we recognized a ceiling test write down of our oil and gas properties totaling million  or million after taxes 
this expense did not impact our cash flow from operations but did reduce net income and stockholders equity 
as a result of having no outstanding obligations on our bank debt for a majority of and an increase in capitalized interest on unevaluated properties  interest expense for decreased to million  compared to million during due to enron corp s financial difficulties  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a allowance for a production accounts receivable due from enron corp 
this allowance resulted in a charge of approximately million to bad debt expense 
our merger with basin was completed on february  in connection with the completion of the merger  we incurred expenses during totaling million 
merger expenses incurred by basin during totaled million 
reserves 
at december   our estimated proved oil and gas reserves totaled bcfe  compared to december  reserves of bcfe 
estimated proved gas reserves grew to bcf at the end of from bcf at year end  and estimated proved oil reserves grew to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year 
the increases in our estimated proved reserve volumes were primarily attributable to drilling results and acquisitions during the year 
the reserve estimates were prepared by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
adherence to these guidelines limited us in booking reserves on successfully drilled wells to the extent of the base of known productive sands 
actual limits of the productive sands will ultimately be determined through production or additional drilling 
our present values of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
you should not assume that the present values of estimated future net cash flows represent the fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
as required by the sec  we determine the present value of estimated future net cash flows using market prices for oil and gas on the last day of the fiscal period 
the average year end oil and gas prices on all of our properties used in determining these amounts  excluding the effects of hedges in place at year end  were per barrel and per mcf for and per barrel and per mcf for compared to for the year  we reported record net income totaling million  or per share  compared to net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
the favorable results in net income were due to improvements in the following components production 
during  production volumes reached a record high totaling bcfe compared to bcfe produced during natural gas production during increased to approximately billion cubic feet compared to gas production of billion cubic feet  while oil production during increased to approximately million barrels compared to million barrels produced during the increase in production rates  compared to  was due to drilling results at several of our fields  the most significant of which were eugene island block and east cameron block prices 
prices realized during averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a increase  on a mcfe basis  over average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
all unit pricing amounts include the effects of hedging 
due to increases in commodity prices throughout  hedging transactions reduced the average price we received during the year for oil by per barrel and for gas by per mcf  compared to net decreases of per barrel and per mcf realized during oil and gas revenue 
as a result of higher production rates and realized prices  oil and gas revenue increased to million  compared to oil and gas revenue of million 
expenses 
normal operating costs during increased to million  compared to million during on a unit of production basis  operating costs were per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the increase in operating costs was due primarily to industry wide increases in the costs of oil field products and services 
during  we performed significant workover operations on nine wells at three fields 
as a result  major maintenance expenses for the year totaled million compared to million for due to increased onshore production volumes combined with higher oil and gas prices  production revenue from onshore properties increased 
as a result  production tax expense increased to million from million in included in the amount was a million production tax refund related to the abatement of severance taxes for certain wells under louisiana state law 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on our oil and gas properties totaled million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe  for the higher dd a rate was partially attributable to the rising costs of oil and gas exploration and development activities during salaries  general and administrative expenses for increased in total to million  or per mcfe  from million  or per mcfe  during due to our operational and financial results and our stock price performance during the year  incentive compensation expense for increased to million compared to million in interest expense for decreased to million  compared to million during  due primarily to the repayment of approximately million of borrowings under stone s bank credit facility in august reserves 
at december   our estimated proved oil and gas reserves totaled bcfe  compared to december  reserves of bcfe 
estimated proved gas reserves grew to bcf at the end of from bcf at year end  while estimated proved oil reserves declined to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year 
our reserve estimates at december  were prepared by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
adherence to these guidelines limits our recognition of proved reserves on successfully drilled wells to the extent of the base of known productive sands 
actual limits of the productive sands will ultimately be determined through production or additional drilling 
our present values of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes were billion and million at december  and  respectively 
you should not assume that the present values of estimated future net cash flows represent the fair value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
as required by the sec  we determine the present value of estimated future net cash flows using market prices for oil and gas on the last day of the fiscal period 
the average year end oil and gas prices on all of our properties used in determining these amounts  excluding the effects of hedges in place at year end  were per barrel and per mcf for and per barrel and per mcf for liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital 
net cash flow from operations before working capital changes for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  reported for working capital at december  totaled million 
our working capital balance is not a good indication of our liquidity because it fluctuates as a result of borrowings or repayments under our credit facility and the timing of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during totaled million and included million of capitalized general and administrative costs  net of reimbursements  and million of capitalized interest 
these investments were financed by borrowings under our bank credit facility  net proceeds from the december bond offering  cash flows from operations and working capital 
our capital expenditures budget is currently approximately million  or less than s capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
the decline in estimated capital investment is due to our outlook on oil and gas prices and our intent to once again finance our capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
the decline in drilling and operating costs and services should enable us to evaluate wells at a much lower cost than in to the extent cash flow from operations exceed our estimated capital expenditures  we plan to pay down a portion of our existing debt 
in the event that cash flow from operations during is not sufficient to fund estimated capital expenditures  we believe that our bank credit facility will provide us with adequate liquidity 
we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are currently evaluating several opportunities that fit our specific acquisition profile 
one or a combination of certain of these possible transactions could fully utilize our existing sources of capital 
although we have no plans to access the public markets for purposes of capital  if the opportunity arose  we would consider such funding sources to provide capital in excess of what is currently available to us 
bank credit facility 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and letters of credit totaling million had been issued pursuant to the facility 
during december  we increased our credit facility to million 
we currently have a loan base under the amended credit facility of million with availability of an additional million in borrowings as of march  stone s borrowing base under the amended credit facility  which is redetermined periodically  is based on an amount established by the bank group for stone s oil and gas properties 
our credit facility provides for certain covenants  including restrictions or requirements with respect to debt to ebitda ratio  net worth  disposition of properties  incurrence of additional debt  change of ownership and reporting responsibilities 
these covenants may limit or prohibit us from paying cash dividends

new accounting standards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstances and also requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur between annual tests indicating that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired 
the standard establishes a new method for testing goodwill for impairment based on a fair value concept and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas nos 
and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements  because we do not have any goodwill recorded 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement will require us to record the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
on january  upon adoption  we will be required to recognize cumulative transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
we have not yet determined the transition amounts 
forward looking statements certain of the statements set forth under this item and elsewhere in this form k are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
see item business forward looking statements and risk factors 
accounting matters and critical accounting policies basis of presentation 
the financial statements include our accounts  the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and our proportionate share of certain partnerships 
on december   these partnerships were dissolved after their assets were transferred to us 
all intercompany balances and transactions that existed prior to these dissolutions have been eliminated 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition and development costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs  incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
we amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through dd a using the future gross revenue method 
under this method  the annual provision for dd a is computed by dividing revenue earned during the period by future gross revenues at the beginning of the period  and applying the resulting rate to the cost of oil and gas properties  including estimated future development  restoration  dismantlement and abandonment costs 
we capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
we also capitalize the portion of employee  general and administrative costs that are attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under the full cost method of accounting  we are required to periodically compare the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves based on period end commodity prices to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties 
we refer to this comparison as a ceiling test 
if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves  we are required to write down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows 
reserves 
estimates of our oil and gas reserves are prepared by our independent petroleum and geological engineers 
proved reserves and the cash flow related to these reserves are estimated based upon a combination of historical data and estimates of future activity 
reserve estimates are used in calculating dd a and in preparation of the full cost ceiling test 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are used primarily when accounting for depreciation  depletion and amortization  unevaluated property costs  estimated future net cash flows  taxes  reserves of accounts receivable  capitalized employee  general and administrative costs  fair value of financial instruments  the purchase price allocation on properties acquired and contingencies 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 as amended  the nature of a derivative instrument must be evaluated to determine if it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as an asset or liability measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  to the extent the hedge is effective 
instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in the balance sheet and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes have been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had deferred taxes of million which was calculated based on our assumption that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize certain tax attribute carryforwards 
for a more complete discussion of our accounting policies see our notes to consolidated financial statements on page f item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and natural gas  which fluctuate widely 
oil and gas price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
in order to manage our exposure to oil and gas price declines  we occasionally enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements to secure a price for a portion of our expected future production 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for trading purposes 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions  depending on the hedging instrument used  may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which o our production is less than expected  o there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  o the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform the contracts  or o a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or gas prices 
our hedging policy provides that not more than one half of our production quantities can be hedged without the consent of the board of directors 
hedging 
during  we realized a net reduction in revenue from our hedging transactions of million 
our contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for the year 
during  we realized a net reduction in revenue from our hedging transactions of million 
our contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for that year 
the net reduction in revenue from hedging transactions for was million 
our contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for that year 
our oil put contracts are with bank of america  na and our gas put contracts are with j 
aron co 
put contracts are purchased at a rate per unit of hedged production that fluctuates with the commodity futures market 
the historical cost of the put contracts represents our maximum cash exposure 
we are not obligated to make any further payments under the put contracts regardless of future commodity price fluctuations 
under put contracts  monthly payments are made to us if prices fall below the agreed upon floor price  while allowing us to fully participate in commodity prices above that floor 
during  we recognized million of hedge premium expenses  which represents amortization of the historical cost associated with oil and gas put contracts that settled during the year 
fixed price swaps typically provide for monthly payments by us if nymex prices rise above the fixed swap price or to us if nymex prices fall below the fixed swap price 
since over of our production has historically been derived from the gulf coast basin  we believe that fluctuations in prices will closely match changes in the market prices we receive for our production 
oil contracts typically settle using the average of the daily closing prices for a calendar month 
natural gas contracts typically settle using the average closing prices for near month nymex futures contracts for the three days prior to the settlement date 
the following tables show our hedging positions as of january  puts gas oil volume cost volume cost bbtus floor millions bbls floor millions fixed price gas swaps volume bbtus price adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 as amended  the nature of a derivative instrument must be evaluated to determine if it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
our hedges are designated as cash flow hedges when entered into 
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as an asset or liability measured at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  to the extent the hedge is effective 
instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in the balance sheet and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december   our oil put contracts were reflected as assets at a historical cost of million and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect at year end  our fixed price gas swap contracts were not reflected in the financial statements since they were costless 
our gas put contracts were purchased in january and therefore were not reflected in the december  balance sheet 
at december   the fair values of our oil put contracts and fixed price gas swaps were million and million  respectively 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  the after tax increase in fair value over historical cost of our oil put contracts of million was a transition adjustment that was recorded as a gain in equity through other comprehensive income 
in addition  the fair market value of the fixed price gas swaps was recorded as a liability and the corresponding after tax loss of million was recorded in equity through other comprehensive income 
our put contracts at december  were considered effective cash flow hedges and changes in fair value of these contracts are reflected in other comprehensive income  net of related taxes 
our natural gas swap contracts are with a subsidiary of enron corp 
due to enron s financial difficulties  there is no assurance that we will receive full or partial payment of any amounts that may become owed to us under these contracts 
accordingly  these swaps no longer qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
as a result  the changes in fair value for each period will now be recorded through earnings and amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income will be amortized through earnings over the remaining life of the swaps 
at december   other comprehensive income included million related to the ineffective gas swaps that will be amortized over the remaining life of the swaps 
included in the non cash derivative expense is a million gain from amortization of other comprehensive income and a million gain related to the change in fair value of the swaps 
stone uses sensitivity analysis techniques to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market prices of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity hedging instruments 
stone had open oil and gas put positions at december  with a positive fair value of million 
as of march   a increase in the underlying price of oil would have reduced the fair value of the oil puts by approximately million 
a increase in the underlying price of natural gas as of march   would have reduced the fair value of our gas puts by approximately million 
at december   we also had open natural gas swap positions with a negative fair value of million 
as of march   a increase in the underlying price of natural gas would have increased the negative fair value of the swaps by approximately million 
the fair value of our derivative instruments was based upon quotes obtained from the counterparties to the hedge agreements 
interest rate risk at december   stone had long term debt outstanding of million 
of this amount  million  or  bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
the remaining million of debt outstanding at the end of bears interest at a floating rate 
because the majority of our long term debt at december  were at fixed rates  we consider our interest rate exposure at such date to be minimal 
at december   we had no open interest rate hedge positions to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable  accounts payable and bank debt approximated book value at december  at december   the fair value of the senior subordinated notes due totaled million and the fair value of the senior subordinated notes due totaled million 
the fair values of the notes have been estimated based on quotes from brokers
