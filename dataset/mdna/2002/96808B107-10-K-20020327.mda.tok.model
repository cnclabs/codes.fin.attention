overview fresh look program 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  we conducted extensive consumer research to determine how to broaden our customer base and increase per customer sales 
based on the results of the research  we formulated our fresh look program a comprehensive advertising  pricing and merchandising program 
in the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal  the company commenced the test of a modified fresh look program in our colorado stores 
the results of such program were encouraging  and we initiated a phased roll out of the complete fresh look program to the colorado stores and an additional stores in connecticut  florida  kansas  massachusetts  missouri  nebraska  new jersey  ohio  oklahoma  oregon and washington over the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the program includes weekly  as opposed to monthly  flyer advertising through direct mail  in store distribution and newspaper insertion  remerchandising to emphasize produce  grocery and meat and seafood offerings  and lowered pricing on selected merchandise throughout the stores 
as part of the program  we are also consolidating our banner names in selected areas across the country to convert stores bearing individually different names to the wild oats market name  to increase advertising synergy and brand awareness 
in the short period in which the program has been in place  we have seen encouraging increases in customer counts and comparable store sales results although average transaction size has remained relatively flat 
we will continue to evaluate the data being produced from the fresh look program stores to determine whether to proceed on a long term basis with the program in its current format or in a modified format 
we currently have stores operating on the program 
we have seen increases in comparable store sales results in most of the stores on the program  for those on the program weeks or more the stores in colorado  the results have been most pronounced 
for stores in the fresh look program for weeks or more  through the end of february  comparable store sales results have increased  from a comparable store sales from january through mid july   to through february these stores have also shown a increase in comparable customer counts  from prior to the commencement of the program to for the period thereafter 
in comparison  for those wild oats market stores not on the fresh look program excluding the farmers market format stores and our capers community market tm stores  for similar periods  overall comparable store sales increased while comparable customer counts increased 
store format and clustering strategy 
we operate two store formats the natural foods supermarket and farmers market formats 
the natural foods supermarket format store  operated under the wild oats r natural marketplace and nature s r a wild oats market tradenames  is generally  to  gross square feet  and the farmers market store  operated under the henry s marketplace r and sun harvest tm tradenames  is generally  to  gross square feet 
our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by the mix of natural foods supermarkets and farmers market stores opened  acquired or relocated and whether stores are being opened in markets where we have an existing presence 
as part of the ongoing comprehensive review of the company s business operations and strategic plan  we are evaluating our current natural foods store format and design  and may make significant changes in the future 
we also plan to expand the henry s marketplace farmers market store format as our second  parallel store format 
we believe this format  which is primarily located in metropolitan san diego  california and texas  appeals to a more value conscious customer 
the format has historically produced higher comparable store sales results than the natural foods supermarket format stores  although margins are lower 
the format also appears to perform better in the face of new competition  whether from conventional or natural foods supermarket competitors 
in the past  we have pursued a strategy of clustering stores in each of our markets to increase overall sales  reduce operating costs and increase customer awareness 
in prior years  when we opened a store in a market where we had an existing presence  our sales and operating results declined at certain of our existing stores in that market 
however  over time  the affected stores generally achieved store contribution margins comparable to prior levels on the lower base of sales 
certain new stores opened in the past two years have caused a greater degree of cannibalization than previously expected  and at this time it does not appear that the store contribution margins at the older  affected stores in these regions will rebound to their prior levels 
in certain existing markets  the sales and operating results trends for other stores may continue to experience temporary declines related to the clustering of stores 
we are currently reevaluating our clustering strategy in response to greater than expected sales cannibalization in certain existing markets where we opened new stores 
comparable store sales results 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations for new  relocated and acquired stores 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales results  including  among others general economic conditions the opening of stores by us or by our competitors in markets where we have existing stores the relative proportion of new or relocated stores to mature stores the timing of advertising and promotional events store remodels store closures our ability to effectively execute our operating plans changes in consumer preferences for natural foods products availability of produce and other seasonal merchandise 
past increases in comparable store sales may not be indicative of future performance 
substantial uncertainty in the current us economy in the wake of the events of september  make it more difficult to determine future performance of certain of our stores  although generally  food sales are not dramatically impacted by economic recessions 
our comparable store sales results have been negatively affected in the past by  among other factors  planned cannibalization  which is the loss of sales at an existing store when we open a new store nearby  resulting from the implementation of our store clustering strategy 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations store format and clustering strategy 
comparable store sales results in previous years were negatively affected by higher than expected cannibalization due to the openings of new or relocated stores in several of our existing markets 
the farmers market format stores  which depend heavily on produce sales  are more susceptible to sales fluctuations resulting from the availability and price of certain produce items 
as a result of operational improvements in some recently acquired stores  the fresh look marketing program in selected regions and store closures of certain weaker stores  comparable store sales increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the third quarter of fiscal  in the second quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal we expect comparable store sales to increase  although as the company expands the implementation of its fresh look program to additional natural foods supermarket stores  the company projects that comparable store sales in those regions in which the initiatives are implemented may increase slightly more as such initiatives increase total store sales 
there can be no assurance that comparable store sales for any particular period will not decrease in the future 
store openings  closings  sales  remodels  relocations and acquisitions 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we opened four new stores in cleveland  ohio  irvine  california  westport  connecticut  and omaha  nebraska 
we postponed the opening of five additional stores originally planned to be opened in fiscal  to allow for the redesign of the interiors of such stores to incorporate feedback received during extensive customer interviews and focus groups conducted in the second quarter of fiscal  to improve the operating efficiency of certain departments and to shift the guests focus to the meat and seafood  produce and grocery departments 
one of the postponed stores is currently planned to open in long beach  california in the first half of fiscal we negotiated a termination of one lease in kansas city  missouri  the opening dates for the remainder have been rescheduled during fiscal or early fiscal in fiscal we closed one natural foods store in denver  colorado and terminated our lease obligation in one location in west palm beach  florida 
we also sold two underperforming stores in san anselmo and sacramento  california  in related transactions 
as of the date of this report  in fiscal we have closed two underperforming stores in boca raton  florida and chesterfield  missouri  sold two additional stores in berkeley and sunnyvale  california to the same purchaser of the other stores in northern california  and sold a store in victoria  british columbia  canada 
we also terminated a lease obligation for one location never opened in kansas city  missouri 
in fiscal  we opened new stores in laguna niguel  san diego two and yorba linda  california  kansas city  kansas  st 
louis  missouri  reno  nevada  cleveland and cincinnati  ohio  bend and portland  oregon  and relocated three stores in west hartford  connecticut  las vegas  nevada  and salt lake city  utah 
we also acquired two operating natural foods stores in escondido and hemet  california 
the company currently has an inventory of vacant sites  comprising both closed store  kitchen and warehouse locations and excess unoccupied space acquired during acquisitions or other leasing transactions  for which we have rent obligations  appropriate accruals have been made for such obligations 
we are actively seeking subtenants or assignees for the spaces  although many of the sites are difficult to sublease or assign because of unusual site characteristics  surpluses of vacant retail space in the markets in which the sites are located  or because the remaining lease terms are relatively short 
in fiscal  we disposed of of our vacant sites  including closed store sites in scottsdale and tempe  arizona  mission viejo and santa barbara  california  denver  colorado  framingham  massachusetts  madison  new jersey  las vegas  nevada  dallas  texas and two smaller sites in salt lake city  utah 
in fiscal  through the date of this report  we have disposed of two additional locations  in santa fe  new mexico and west hartford  connecticut  both in transactions where the landlord took a reassignment of the space in exchange for payment to the company of cash or rent abatements 
in some cases we have negotiated lease terminations with the landlords in exchange for a cash payment by us 
where appropriate  we have made vacant space available for use by charitable organizations which cover the utilities costs for the space while we continue to pay the rent obligation 
our ability to increase the number of stores opened in fiscal and beyond may depend upon our ability to raise additional equity financings 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  we were in default under our million credit facility as a result of our violation of certain financial covenants in our loan agreement 
in october  we executed an amendment to our credit facility  pursuant to which all previous defaults under the credit facility were waived 
as part of such amendment  our borrowings have been limited to million  and we agreed to restrictive covenants  including covenants regarding our ability to enter into new leases and to make certain capital expenditures 
absent additional equity funding  the limitations on capital expenditures will not allow us to complete and open in fiscal all of the stores for which we currently have signed leases  therefore  some openings have been rescheduled into early fiscal we have proposed to raise million or more in equity financings  and have executed confidentiality agreements with and provided due diligence to a number of interested parties 
to date  we have received several offers for investment in the company 
the company is currently investigating other  less dilutive equity alternatives 
if the company is successful in raising additional equity financing of million or more  under the terms of the amended credit agreement we will be allowed to increase the number of new leases we may execute and new stores we may open  based on the amount of equity financings raised and the format of the stores proposed to be opened 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as has been our practice in the past  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition  and sales growth potential of all of our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
in fiscal  as part of restructuring and asset impairment charges taken in the second and fourth quarters  we identified stores for closure or sale  of which have been closed or sold 
changing facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal have led us to remove the remaining two stores from our list of closures or sales 
one of these stores was expected to be closed or sold by the end of fiscal in conjunction with the company s opening of a new store in the same city  however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company abandoned the new store site due to parking issues created during construction of the site 
due to this change in facts and circumstances  management decided to continue to operate the existing store in its existing location  therefore  the restructuring charges of  previously recorded for the existing store were reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal with regard to the other store  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed a competitive analysis of the market area and a re evaluation of the operations of the store  which showed that the store was achieving acceptable performance levels and demonstrating positive performance trends following the implementation of the fresh look program late in the third quarter of fiscal due to this change in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management decided to continue to operate the store in its existing location  therefore  the restructuring charges of million previously recorded for the store were reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we identified an additional three stores slated for closure or sale  including one location in west palm beach  florida where we terminated our leasehold interest in the second quarter of fiscal the other two stores were removed from our list of closures or sales due to changes in estimates related to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company had planned to close or sell both stores in conjunction with the company s opening of new stores in the respective trade areas  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company abandoned its plans for the new store sites and decided to continue to operate the existing stores in their existing locations and reversed  of restructuring charges previously recorded for the existing stores 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  advertising  utilities  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
historically  pre opening expenses for natural foods supermarket format stores have averaged approximately  to  per store  and farmers market format stores have averaged approximately  per store  although the amount per store may vary depending on whether the store is the first to be opened in a market or is part of a cluster of stores in that market 
as part of the fresh look advertising initiatives implemented by the company  we expect that pre opening expenses will increase to  per natural foods supermarket store  and  per farmers market store  as we boost grand opening and weekly advertising 
consolidation of store banners  which was implemented in the last half of fiscal  should improve advertising synergies in many regions of the country 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
as a result of the march transition to our new chief executive officer and a new management philosophy  the company has been and continues to conduct an extensive review of all components of our business  including our previously announced strategic repositioning initiatives  as well as current marketing  purchasing  merchandising and new store programs 
this comprehensive review is intended to aggressively reexamine all aspects of our business for opportunities to improve  strengthen  streamline and reposition our business operations 
as a result of this review  the company has and continues to make significant changes to our current business strategy and methods of operations with the goal of increasing comparable store sales  average transaction size and customer count 
initiatives implemented at of our natural foods supermarket stores as part of our fresh look program include reductions in many items everyday pricing  increases in frequency and distribution of advertising  modifications of staffing and remerchandising of selected stores 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s management made certain decisions relating to the company s operations which identified three stores to be closed or abandoned by the end of fiscal  reduced the company s regional offices and certain staff  changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges  and resulted in a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
see notes to consolidated financials statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges 
after a comprehensive review of the company s support facilities was completed by management during the third quarter of fiscal  management determined that the operations of certain support facilities should be eliminated 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of  resulting primarily from the closure of three support facilities a bakery in tucson  arizona  and two commissary kitchens in los angeles  california and santa fe  new mexico 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s management made certain decisions relating to the company s operations which identified three stores to be closed or abandoned by the second quarter of fiscal  changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges  and resulted in restructuring and asset impairment income of  see notes to consolidated financials statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates  including those related to asset impairment charges restructuring charges and store closing costs allowance for bad debt inventory valuation and reserves self insurance reserves reserves for contingencies and litigation goodwill valuation we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for potential impairment at the store level 
the triggering events for such evaluations include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  acquisition and construction costs in excess of budget  or current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses 
the company records an asset impairment charge when an impairment is identified 
future adverse changes in asset market values or store operating results could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby requiring an asset impairment charge in the future 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges  for an additional discussion of our policies regarding the calculation of asset impairments 
the company plans to complete store closures or sales within a one year period following the commitment date 
costs related to store closures and sales are reflected in the income statement as restructuring and asset impairment charges 
for stores the company intends to sell  the company actively markets the stores to potential buyers 
stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
for stores the company intends to close  a lease related liability is recorded for the present value of the estimated remaining noncancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income  or for estimated lease settlement costs 
in addition  the company records a liability for costs to be incurred after the store closing which are required under leases or local ordinances for site preservation during the period before lease termination 
the value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect recoverable values based on the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
severance costs incurred in connection with store closings are recorded when the employees have been identified and notified of the termination benefits to be made to the employees 
lease related liabilities and the recoverability of assets to be disposed of are reviewed quarterly  and changes in previous estimates are reflected in operations 
significant cash payments associated with closed stores relate to ongoing payments of rent  common area maintenance  insurance charges  and real property taxes as required under continuing lease obligations 
the company maintains allowances for bad debt for estimated losses resulting from the inability of third parties to make required payments 
if the financial condition of such third parties were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company maintains allowances for excess or unsaleable inventory as a percentage of its gross inventory balance based on historical experience and assumptions about market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the company expands its forward buying of inventory which will increase its inventory levels  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation claims and employee medical and dental benefits 
the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant levels of claims 
self insured losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the company s historical experiences 
if the company experiences an increase in claims  if actuarial assumptions are inaccurate  or if insurance industry costs increase beyond current expectations  then additional reserves may be required 
the company maintains reserves for contingencies and litigation based on management s best estimates of potential liability in the event of a judgment against the company  and possible settlement costs  as well as existing facts and circumstances 
future adverse changes related to current contingencies and litigation could necessitate additional reserves in the future 
results of operations the net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal in addition to the restructuring income of  recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of the company s strategic repositioning activities during fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of approximately million in the second and third quarters of fiscal excluding these charges  the company reported a pro forma net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared with pro forma net income of million  or per diluted share  excluding million in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the sale and closure of underperforming stores and the discontinuation of e commerce activities in fiscal the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges income loss from operations loss on investment interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the opening of four new stores in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as the inclusion of the stores opened or acquired in fiscal  offset by three stores closed or sold in fiscal and stores closed or sold in fiscal higher comparable store sales from existing stores contributed slightly more than half of the fiscal sales increase  with new stores contributing the balance 
comparable store sales increased for fiscal  as compared to a decrease for fiscal some of the comparable store sales increases are attributable to the phased roll out of a number of strategic initiatives as part of the fresh look program  which are projected to increase overall sales gradually in those regions in which the initiatives are implemented  through increased advertising  more frequent advertised specials and modified pricing 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the smaller percentage increase in gross profit is due primarily to lower merchandise margins resulting from the implementation of pricing reductions as part of the fresh look program as well as a shift in the sales mix between store formats 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to lower merchandise margins resulting from the implementation of the fresh look program  as well as a shift in the sales mix between store formats  increases in inventory reserves for slow moving goods  lower margins on certain categories of products sold in the stores  higher utilities expenses and higher than expected coupon activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal as the company expands the fresh look program to additional stores in fiscal  gross profit in fiscal may be negatively affected by lower margins on certain items 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases are primarily due to increased payroll associated with an increase in the number of stores in operation  enhanced customer service efforts as part of the fresh look program  additional benefit days due to a change in vacation policy in fiscal  increased health and dental  workers compensation  and general liability insurance costs related to general market conditions  and an increase in repairs and maintenance costs 
we anticipate that we will see increases in fiscal and beyond in the area of employee related insurance and general liability insurance costs 
on an absolute basis  we expect direct store expenses to increase with the addition of new stores  but on a percentage of sales basis to be consistent with fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increases are attributable to consulting and professional fees resulting from the comprehensive review of our business and strategic position million  severance costs for former senior executives million  recruiting and relocation costs  and expenses associated with the october amendment to our million credit facility  as well as increases in advertising and merchandising expenses related to the implementation of the fresh look program and expenses for expanded infrastructure at the company s headquarters to support the new advertising  merchandising and pricing initiatives 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as part of the company s expanded strategic repositioning  we expect to spend additional funds on marketing at the national level  as well as increased corporate and regional support staffs 
as a result of these increased expenditures  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal over fiscal levels in both absolute and percentage terms 
the increase is primarily due to increased marketing expense in conjunction with the continuing fresh look implementation  annualization of payroll expenses for staff additions in fiscal  and increased employee related insurance costs 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to the opening of four new stores in fiscal as compared to the opening of new and relocated stores in fiscal as part of the company s increase in marketing efforts relating to the fresh look program  we anticipate that pre opening expenses for new natural foods supermarket stores will increase from an estimated  historically to an estimated  per new store  and those of the farmers market format will increase from  historically to an estimated  in the future 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal  due to higher average borrowings in fiscal and higher swap related interest rates on the term portion of the credit facility in fiscal as part of the amendment to the credit facility  the interest rate on the facility was amended to either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates increase by starting january  and each six months thereafter through january  when the rate will remain constant through the end of the agreement in august due to the current state of the us economy  management believes that the variable interest rates will remain constant during the next six to months

restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal as a result of hiring a new chief executive officer just prior to the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  and a comprehensive review conducted by the new chief executive officer of our business and strategic repositioning efforts during the second quarter of fiscal  we identified and committed to a restructuring plan during the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million such asset impairments were recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets to be disposed of 
details of the significant components of the charge are as follows change in estimate related to fixed asset impairments for previously identified sites held for disposal million during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that certain fixed assets were not compatible with a new store design 
due to the new store design  such assets could not be relocated as contemplated under the original restructuring plan 
as a result  we determined we could not recover the previously estimated carrying value of these assets  and therefore recognized an impairment charge and disposed of the assets during the second quarter of fiscal change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for previously identified sites for closure million during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that additional periods of time were necessary to dispose of certain lease obligations 
this determination was driven by our results of current disposition efforts  and is attributable to deteriorating real estate markets in certain regions  existing lease obligations at above market rates  and unattractive site characteristics 
the charge for exit costs assumes  based on our current results of disposition efforts  that we will be successful in disposing of these long term lease obligations within the next five years 
facts and circumstances can change in the future with respect to the above attributes  affecting the ultimate resolution of these exit costs 
we will make appropriate adjustments to the restructuring liabilities contemporaneous with any change in facts and circumstances 
fixed asset impairments for three additional stores identified in the second quarter of fiscal to be abandoned  closed  or sold by the end of fiscal million during the second quarter of fiscal  we became involved in litigation filed by the landlord of a site under construction 
we decided not to proceed with the opening of the store and consequently abandoned the site and the related fixed assets leasehold improvements totaling million during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  the fixed assets of two other stores that were scheduled to be closed by the end of fiscal comprised the remaining  of the charge 
fixed asset impairments for subleased properties identified during the second quarter of fiscal million these asset impairments relate to leasehold improvements made by the company in subleased properties for specific subtenants 
during the second quarter of fiscal  certain subtenants either vacated the improved properties without prior notice or gave notice to us that they planned to vacate the properties shortly  and certain other subtenants were in financial distress and in one case  had filed for bankruptcy protection 
we determined that we could not recover the carrying value of these build to suit leasehold improvements and therefore recognized an impairment charge 
certain of these assets were disposed of during the second quarter of fiscal and the remainder were disposed of by the end of fiscal lease related liabilities for subleased properties identified during the second quarter of fiscal million during the second quarter of fiscal  certain subtenants either vacated the improved properties without prior notice or gave notice to us that they planned to vacate the properties shortly 
we also were informed in the second quarter that certain other subtenants were in financial distress and in one case  had filed for bankruptcy protection 
the lease related liabilities represent our estimate to dispose of these lease obligations based on current disposition efforts  and is attributable to deteriorating real estate markets in certain regions  existing lease obligations at above market rates  and unattractive site characteristics 
the charge for exit costs assumes  based on our current results of disposition efforts  that the company will be successful in disposing of these long term lease obligations within the next five years 
facts and circumstances can change in the future with respect to the above attributes affecting the ultimate resolution of these exit costs 
we will make appropriate adjustments to the restructuring liabilities contemporaneous with the change in facts and circumstances 
fixed asset impairments for regional and departmental office closures and consolidations during the second quarter of fiscal million as part of our reorganization during the second quarter of fiscal  we reduced our regional offices from to five offices  and eliminated much of our construction department 
in conjunction with these modifications to regional and departmental structures  we determined that we could not recover the carrying value of the fixed assets used by certain regional and departmental offices and our construction department  and therefore recognized an impairment charge and disposed of the assets during the second quarter of fiscal fixed asset impairments for store construction project discontinuation million during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that a new store design was required  and construction of new stores and expansion and remodel activities at existing stores based on the previously developed designs would be abandoned to incorporate the new store design changes 
assets in this charge included abandoned construction in progress primarily leasehold improvements 
we determined that we could not recover the carrying value of these fixed assets  and therefore recognized an impairment charge and disposed of the assets during the second quarter of fiscal severance for employees terminated during the second quarter of fiscal million during the second quarter of fiscal  of our  employees were terminated as part of the company s restructuring plan 
the terminated employee groups were regional store support  construction and new store development  and corporate office personnel 
as of december   million of involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees  the remaining benefits of  will be paid during the first half of fiscal in addition to the restructuring charges described above  in the second quarter of fiscal management also identified asset impairment charges of million in accordance with the provisions of sfas related to five stores held for use 
these assets became impaired in the second quarter of fiscal because the projected future cash flows of each store at that time were not sufficient to fully recover the carrying value of the stores long lived assets 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the store s future cash flows on an undiscounted basis  and if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  then the company uses a discounted cash flow based on a risk adjusted discount rate to adjust its carrying value of the assets  and records a provision for impairment as appropriate 
we believe the weak performance from the stores included in the asset impairment charge were caused by significant budget overruns in construction one store  poor site location two stores or insufficient advertising in new regional markets two stores 
we continually reevaluate our stores performance to monitor the carrying value of long lived assets in comparison to projected cash flows 
elements that could contribute to impairment of long lived assets include new competition  overruns in construction costs  or poor operating results caused by a variety of factors  including improper site selection  insufficient advertising  or changes in local  regional or national economies 
we are currently reevaluating the store format and construction procedures to reduce the likelihood of construction cost overruns  and have increased our projected pre opening costs per new store to increase the level of new store advertising 
site selection criteria are also being reevaluated in light of the results of the company s comprehensive review of all operations and ideal customer demographics 
there is no assurance that in the future  additional long lived assets will not be impaired 
after a comprehensive review of our support facilities was completed by management during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that the operations of certain support facilities should be eliminated 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of  resulting primarily from the closure of three support facilities a bakery in tucson  arizona  and two commissary kitchens in los angeles  california and santa fe  new mexico 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring income of million consisting of the following components change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale that were closed  sold or disposed of during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal million of restructuring income during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold two stores in san anselmo and sacramento  california  in related transactions  we subsequently sold two additional stores in berkeley and sunnyvale  california  to the same purchaser of the other northern california stores 
in conjunction with these transactions  the purchaser assumed the lease related obligations associated with these stores 
based on this change in facts and circumstances  we reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these stores and therefore recognized restructuring income of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  we also assigned to a third party or terminated lease obligations for sites in madison  new jersey and boca raton  florida  respectively  based on this change in facts and circumstances  we reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these stores and therefore recognized restructuring income of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal change in estimate related to fixed asset impairments for four stores previously identified for closure or sale million of restructuring income due to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that four stores previously identified as sites held for disposal would continue to operate in their existing locations 
three of the stores were expected to be closed in conjunction with the company s opening of new stores in the respective trade areas  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to abandon the new store sites and continue to operate the existing stores 
with regard to the fourth store  management decided in the fourth quarter of fiscal to continue to operate the store in its existing location after completing a competitive analysis of the market area and a reevaluation of the operations of the store in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which showed that the store was achieving acceptable performance levels and demonstrating positive performance trends following the implementation of the fresh look program late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we reversed the restructuring charge previously recorded for the fixed asset impairments related to these four stores and therefore recognized restructuring income of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for four stores previously identified for closure or sale million of restructuring income due to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that four stores previously identified as sites held for disposal would continue to operate in their existing locations 
three of the stores were expected to be closed in conjunction with the company s opening of new stores in the respective trade areas  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to abandon the new store sites and continue to operate the existing stores 
with regard to the fourth store  management decided in the fourth quarter of fiscal to continue to operate the store in its existing location after completing a competitive analysis of the market area and a reevaluation of the operations of the store in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which showed that the store was achieving acceptable performance levels and demonstrating positive performance trends following the implementation of the fresh look program late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we reversed the restructuring charge previously recorded for the long term lease obligations related to these four stores and therefore recognized restructuring income of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal fixed asset impairments for three additional stores and one support facility identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal to be closed or sold by the second quarter of fiscal million of restructuring expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to close two stores in fiscal following the negotiation of a lease obligation settlement for one store in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the completion of an operations analysis for the other store  which showed that the intensive fresh look marketing and merchandising efforts initiated at the store early in the fourth quarter of were not improving the store s sales and profit trends 
we also decided to close one support facility in the second quarter of fiscal after deciding in the fourth quarter of fiscal to outsource the operations of the support facility to an identified external food service supplier 
we determined that we could not recover the carrying value of the fixed assets at these locations and therefore recognized an impairment charge 
certain of these assets were disposed of during the first quarter of fiscal  and the remainder will be disposed of by the end of the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also decided to abandon construction of a new store in kansas city  missouri  due to location and parking related issues 
assets in this charge included abandoned construction in progress primarily leasehold improvements 
we determined that we could not recover the carrying value of these fixed assets and therefore recognized an impairment charge and disposed of the assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal lease related liabilities for three additional stores and one support facility identified during the fourth quarter of fiscal to be closed or sold by the second quarter of fiscal million of restructuring expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to close two stores in fiscal following the negotiation of a lease obligation settlement for one store in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the completion of an operations analysis for the other store  which showed that the intensive fresh look marketing and merchandising efforts initiated at the store early in the fourth quarter of were not improving the store s sales and profit trends 
we also decided to close one support facility in the second quarter of fiscal after determining in the fourth quarter of fiscal to outsource the operations of the support facility to an identified external food service supplier 
the lease related liabilities for these locations represent our estimate to dispose of these lease obligations based on current disposition efforts  and is attributable to deteriorating real estate markets in certain regions  existing lease obligations at above market rates  and unattractive site characteristics 
the charge for exit costs assumes  based on our current results of disposition efforts  that the company will be successful in disposing of these long term lease obligations within the next five years 
facts and circumstances can change in the future with respect to the above attributes affecting the ultimate resolution of these exit costs 
we will make appropriate adjustments to the restructuring liabilities contemporaneous with the change in facts and circumstances 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also decided to abandon construction of a new store in kansas city  missouri due to location and parking related issues 
we subsequently terminated the lease obligation for a commitment to pay up to  severance for employees terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  employees were terminated in conjunction with the closure of four support facilities 
the employees were notified of their involuntary termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december    of involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees  the remaining benefits of  will be paid during the first half of fiscal in addition to the restructuring charges described above  in the fourth quarter of fiscal management also identified asset impairment charges of million in accordance with the provisions of sfas related to four stores held for use 
these assets became impaired in the fourth quarter of fiscal because the projected future cash flows of each store at that time were not sufficient to fully recover the carrying value of the stores long lived assets 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the store s future cash flows on an undiscounted basis  and if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover carrying value  then the company uses a discounted cash flow based on a risk adjusted discount rate  to adjust its carrying value of the assets and records a provision for impairment as appropriate 
we believe the weak performance from the stores included in the asset impairment charge were caused by poor site location two stores or insufficient advertising in new regional markets two stores 
we continually reevaluate our stores performance to monitor the carrying value of long lived assets in comparison to projected cash flows 
elements that could contribute to impairment of long lived assets include new competition  overruns in construction costs  or poor operating results caused by a variety of factors  including improper site selection  insufficient advertising  or changes in local  regional or national economies 
we are currently reevaluating the store format and construction procedures to reduce the likelihood of construction cost overruns  and have increased our projected pre opening costs per new store to increase the level of new store advertising 
site selection criteria are also being reevaluated in light of the results of the company s comprehensive review of all operations and ideal customer demographics 
there is no assurance that in the future  additional long lived assets will not be impaired 
during fiscal and through the date of this report  the company terminated lease obligations for store sites in west palm beach  florida and kansas city  missouri and closed a store in boca raton  florida as part of the fiscal restructuring plans 
with regard to the current status of the six stores identified for closure or sale as part of the company s fiscal restructuring plans  as of march   three of the stores have been closed or sold  one remains to be closed or sold in the second quarter of fiscal the remaining two stores have been removed from the list of closures or sales due to changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we made certain decisions relating to the strategic repositioning of the company s operations which resulted in a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
these decisions included the closure of three natural foods stores during the second quarter of fiscal million  the planned sale or closure of seven stores during the remainder of fiscal million  exit costs of previously closed or abandoned sites million  and the discontinuance of e commerce activities 
the million charge related to changes in estimates for previously closed or abandoned sites 
the significant components of the million charge were a million of additional lease related liabilities  and b million of fixed asset impairments for previously closed stores 
components of the restructuring and asset impairment charge consist of impairment of fixed million and intangible assets million  and non cancelable lease obligations and liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expanded the strategic repositioning and  as a part of such expansion  decided to close or sell underperforming stores 
this decision resulted in an additional restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
this restructuring charge consists primarily of costs associated with the abandonment of fixed million and intangible assets million and non cancelable lease obligations and lease related liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges 
during fiscal and through the date of this report  two of the identified natural foods stores were closed in denver  colorado and chesterfield  missouri as part of the fiscal restructuring plans and five of the identified stores were sold 
with regard to the current status of the stores identified for closure or sale as part of the company s fiscal restructuring plans  as of march   of the stores have been closed or sold 
the remaining two stores have been removed from the list of closures or sales due to changes in estimates based on changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal as part of the strategic repositioning announced by the company in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company identified natural foods stores for closure or sale due to weak performance 
in fiscal  we closed and sold three of those identified stores 
in the second quarter of fiscal  as part of additional evaluation of the company s operations by new management  we identified an additional three stores for closure in fiscal  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we extended our evaluation and identified an additional three stores for closure in fiscal and in fiscal and through the date of this report  the company closed three of the identified stores  terminated its lease related obligations as to two of the identified locations and sold five of the identified stores  four in related transactions 
one store remains to be closed or sold in fiscal the company also closed two small vitamin stores in the second and third quarters of fiscal due to a change in estimates related to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to continue to operate four stores previously identified for closure or sale 
a summary of restructuring activity by store count is as follows restructuring store count fiscal year ending period ending march  stores remaining at commencement of period stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale identified stores closed or abandoned identified stores sold reversal of stores identified for closure or sale identified stores remaining at period end restructuring accruals 
the material changes in the liability balances of each significant type of exit cost included in the restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal were related to changes in estimates for lease defeasance costs and for the net realizable value of fixed assets 
the changes in estimates during the second quarter of fiscal for lease defeasance costs in the restructuring charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal resulted from the economic downturn during fiscal  which has made it more difficult to find sublease tenants and settle lease terminations with landlords particularly in the case of leases with above market rents 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received updated estimates from various external sources ie  landlords and real estate brokers of the costs to exit certain lease obligations 
due to the economic downturn that worsened during the second quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimates of the costs associated with subleasing properties or settling lease terminations with landlords 
due to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that four stores previously identified as sites held for disposal would continue to operate in their existing locations 
three of the stores were expected to be closed in conjunction with the company s opening of new stores in the respective trade areas  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to abandon the new store sites and continue to operate the existing stores 
with regard to the fourth store  management decided in the fourth quarter of fiscal to continue to operate the store in its existing location after completing a competitive analysis of the market area and a reevaluation of the operations of the store in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which showed that the store was achieving acceptable performance levels and demonstrating positive performance trends following the implementation of the fresh look program late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we reversed the restructuring accruals previously recorded for the long term lease obligations related to these four stores 
the material cash outlays associated with the company s exit plans are primarily for lease related obligations 
as of december   the components of the accruals related to the company s restructuring activities are accrued liabilities million and other long term obligations million 
employee severance benefits are another cash outlay that will be paid out during the next five months 
as of december   million of the million of involuntary termination benefits accrued during the second quarter of fiscal had been paid to terminated employees 
the employee severance benefits relate to the termination of employment of of our  employees 
income tax benefit 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a million income tax benefit  primarily as a result of the loss before taxes of million during the period 
the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
although realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
our assessment is based on projections that assume that the company can maintain its current store contribution margin 
furthermore  we expect to maintain the sales growth experienced over the past five years that would generate additional taxable income 
the primary uncertainty related to the realization of the deferred tax asset is the company s ability to achieve its four year business plan and generate future taxable income to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
we believe that the sales  gross margin  store contribution margin  and selling  general and administrative expenses assumptions in our four year business plan are reasonable and  more likely than not  attainable 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset and to the extent it is determined in the future that a valuation allowance is required  it will be recognized as a charge to earnings at that time 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal and fiscal each contained weeks of operations 
sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of two stores  the opening of new stores  and the relocation of three stores  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for the eight new stores opened  five stores relocated  and stores acquired in fiscal comparable store sales decreased for fiscal  as compared to a increase for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the acquisition of two stores  the opening of new stores and the relocation of three stores 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to acquisition integration difficulties in oregon  massachusetts and texas 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in direct store expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores operated by the company 
as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the increased number of acquired and newly opened stores in late fiscal  acquisition integration difficulties and significant investments that the company has made in employee benefit programs  particularly expanded health insurance offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to additions in the corporate and regional staff necessary to support the company s accelerated growth in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained constant at in fiscal from fiscal as part of the company s expanded strategic repositioning  we expect to spend additional funds on marketing at the national level  as well as increased corporate and regional support staffs 
as a result of these increased expenditures  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal pre opening expenses 
in april  the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of start up activities  which required that preopening expenses be expensed as incurred 
we adopted the policy in fiscal pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in pre opening expenses is attributable to the increase in the number of stores opened 
as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses remained constant at due to the opening of new stores including three relocations in fiscal as compared to new stores including five relocations in fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges 
restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the expenses for fiscal consisted of two separate strategic repositioning efforts 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s management made certain decisions relating to the strategic repositioning of the company s operations which resulted in a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
these decisions included the closure of three natural food stores during the second quarter of fiscal million  the planned sale or closure of seven stores during the remainder of fiscal million  exit costs of previously closed or abandoned sites million  and the discontinuation of e commerce activities 
the million charge related to changes in estimates for previously closed or abandoned sites 
the significant components of the million charge were a million of additional lease related liabilities  and b million of fixed asset impairments for previously closed stores 
components of the restructuring and asset impairment charge consist primarily of abandonment of fixed million and intangible assets million  and noncancelable lease obligations and lease related liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company expanded its strategic repositioning and  as a part of such expansion  decided to close or sell under performing stores 
this decision resulted in an additional restructuring charge of million 
this restructuring charge consists primarily of costs associated with the abandonment of fixed million and intangible assets million and noncancelable lease obligations and lease related liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges 
loss on investment 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a loss on investment of million related to the reduction in value of the company s investment in an e commerce nutritional company 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  net interest expense increased to from in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings on our line of credit to fund acquisitions  new stores  relocations and remodels 
interest expense may increase in the future as a result of increased borrowing and or an expected increase in the interest rate under our credit facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources below 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations which includes trade payables  bank indebtedness  and the sale of equity securities 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development  new store openings  relocations  remodels and acquisitions and repayment of debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal cash from operating activities decreased during this period primarily due to a pre tax loss  offset by changes in working capital items and restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we have not required significant external financing to support inventory requirements at our existing and new stores because we have been able to rely on vendor financing for most of the inventory costs  and we anticipate that vendor financing will continue to be available for new store openings 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in capital expenditures and acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the decrease reflects lower incremental borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we have a net deferred tax asset of million on our balance sheet  primarily as a result of the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal the net deferred tax asset will reduce cash required for payment of federal and state income taxes  as we believe we will generate sufficient taxable income for realization of the asset in the future 
the following is a summary of our lease and debt obligations  construction commitments and outstanding letters of credit as of december  summary of obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases construction commitments total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years other commercial commitments letters of credit total commercial commitments amendment to credit facility 
our current credit facility has two separate lines of credit  a revolving line and a term loan facility  each with a three year term expiring august  as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving line and million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan 
the credit agreement includes certain financial and other covenants  as well as restrictions on payments of dividends 
as of december   we were in violation of two financial covenants  and the lending group issued a notice of default  although it did not accelerate our repayment obligations 
the defaults were waived as part of the execution of an amendment to the credit facility on october  the amendment entered into with our lenders includes an initial increase in our interest rate  with additional increases each six months through january  increases in agency fees  and quarterly and yearly aggregate limits on the execution of new leases  opening of new stores and new store capital expenditures  as well as modification of other previously existing financial covenants 
our borrowings under the amended credit facility have been limited to million 
as part of the amendment  we have granted a security interest to our lenders in all of our cash  equipment and fixtures  inventory and other assets  other than the proceeds of any equity offering that may be concluded by us 
we also have an obligation to obtain leasehold mortgages on all new leases executed after the date of the amendment  and to maintain  from february  through the maturity date of the credit facility  leasehold mortgages on existing leases for stores generating at least of the total sales revenues of the company 
following the execution of the amendment  we requested and received a waiver of performance under the september stockholders equity covenant  and a modification of the performance requirements under the stockholders equity covenants for october and november  and executed amendments to the credit agreement reflecting such modifications in november and december we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure requirements in fiscal if we are successful in concluding an equity offering of at least million in net proceeds  the number of new leases that we will be permitted to sign and the number of new stores we will be permitted to open under our credit facility will be proportionately increased  based upon the format of the stores proposed to be opened natural foods supermarket stores are more expensive to build and open and therefore  under the credit agreement  fewer may be opened from equity proceeds 
as a result  the company s sales growth rate could accelerate as a portion of any equity financing proceeds are used to fund the construction of additional stores not currently planned 
the company s credit agreement contains certain monthly and quarterly financial covenants  which become more restrictive during fiscal and the company anticipates that it will continue to comply in fiscal and with the monthly and quarterly financial covenants in the credit agreement 
management s current business plans for the company anticipate significant improvement in financial position attributable to increases in revenues due to comparable store sales increases  improved working capital management  reduced capital spending  successful implementation of ongoing cost savings initiatives  and improved operating efficiencies 
in the event that business conditions worsen  management has identified contingency actions to enable the company to remain in compliance with the financial covenants 
such actions  including reductions in operating expenses together with lower capital spending  may result in fewer new store openings in fiscal  which may negatively impact revenues 
the company currently expects to meet the amended credit agreement covenants throughout fiscal and  however  if business conditions are other than as anticipated or other unseen events occur and the company s planned contingency actions are unsuccessful in countering such events  these may impact the company s ability to remain in compliance 
even if the company remains in compliance with its monetary covenants  a technical default could result due to a breach of the financial covenants 
in the absence of a waiver or amendment to such financial covenants  such non compliance would constitute a default under the credit agreement  and the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder 
in the event that such non compliance appears likely  or occurs  the company will seek approval  as it has in the past  from the lenders to renegotiate financial covenants and or obtain waivers  as required 
however  there can be no assurance that future amendments or waivers will be obtained 
the company is proposing to raise approximately million to million in a private placement of the company s equity to provide additional liquidity  although such equity financing is not a requirement of the amended credit facility 
a number of parties have conducted  and several parties are currently conducting  due diligence on the company related to the proposed private placement 
we have received several offers for investment in the company 
based on the company s overall improvement in operational results  and indications that other financing vehicles with a greater return and lower dilutive effects to the company may be available  the company is currently evaluating other financing alternatives 
the company provided projections through fiscal of the company s operational results to the potential investors conducting due diligence in connection with the private placement 
the projections were based on an assumed infusion of million in net common equity financing proceeds received in the first half of  combined with internally generated cash to accelerate new store openings 
based on such assumptions  the company projected the following new store openings in would number four or five with most of the openings occurring in the second half of the year 
in fiscal  additional new stores would number the number of new stores added would double to in fiscal and would approximate in fiscal the compound annual growth rate in comparable store sales results were projected  based on actual comparable store sales results  to increase to company wide 
company wide net sales were projected to increase on a compound annual rate of to  based on actual net sales 
net earnings were projected to turn positive in fiscal and achieve at least a after tax return on sales by earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation amortization ebitda were projected to average a compound annual growth rate of to from fiscal to with growth in any one year not falling below 
the projections provided to potential investors  including but not limited to the net income and ebitda projections  are subject to uncertainties  including but not limited to the following whether the company will complete an equity financing and  if completed  the timing of net proceeds and terms of such equity financing  the ability to locate suitable sites for new stores and successfully negotiate acceptable lease terms  the ability to open the projected number of stores  the success of the fresh look program in existing stores and our ability to successfully implement the fresh look program in additional wild oats stores  the ability to control and increase gross margins on products sold in our stores  the ability to successfully negotiate a new distribution agreement with a primary distributor on terms more favorable to the company  continued sales growth in excess of the increases in sales realized in fiscal  increases in the average transaction size per customer in all stores  receipt of vendor financial support for certain advertising initiatives  and our ability to leverage direct store and selling  general and administrative expenses as well as renegotiate our current credit facility  or enter into a new credit agreement with a new lending group at more favorable terms than those in our current agreement 
there is no assurance that any of the foregoing can be achieved or that the projections will be met 
we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy  which is required by our amended credit facility terms  that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates 
the company s specific goals are to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of some of its debt and lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
in accordance with the company s interest rate risk management strategy  and in accordance with the requirements of our credit facility  the company has entered into a swap agreement to hedge the interest rate on million of its borrowings 
the swap agreement locks in a one month libor rate of and expires in august capital expenditures 
we spent approximately million during fiscal for new store construction  development  remodels and other capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions 
capital expenditures originally planned for certain of the stores rescheduled to open in fiscal were incurred commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal the aggregate amount to construct all five originally scheduled stores was originally estimated at million to million  but may be revised downward as part of our comprehensive review of the business operations and strategic plan 
our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately million to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
as part of our reexamination of our operating strategies  we anticipate that the average capital expenditures to open a natural foods supermarket format store will be million to million in the future  partly because of our decision to reduce the size or simplify the format of our food service department in new stores  as well as our decision not to increase store size in the majority of geographic areas 
our average capital expenditures to open a farmers market format store are estimated at million to million in the future 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures and increased pre opening costs for the site  as well as lower than planned sales for the company 
under our amended credit facility  we are limited in our capital expenditures to million in the first quarter of fiscal  increasing to an aggregate million in the second quarter and an aggregate million in the third quarter 
proceeds from any equity offering in excess of million may be used to increase our total allowable level of capital expenditures by million per natural foods supermarket format store and million per farmers market format store 
if we are successful in raising the additional equity financing  we plan to use the equity proceeds to complete the early construction of two stores in fiscal and execute leases for and commence capital expenditures on up to new stores through fiscal although there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels  we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our budgeted capital expenditure requirements through the remainder of fiscal the cost of initial inventory for a new store is approximately  to  depending on the store format  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
pre opening costs currently are approximately  to  per store and are expensed as incurred 
pre opening costs for natural foods supermarket format stores in the future are projected to increase from  to  per store  and pre opening costs for farmers market format stores are projected to increase from  to  as a result of increased advertising for new stores 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels  although our amended credit facility contains aggregate limits on the amounts of capital expenditures we may make 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our budgeted cash requirements through fiscal cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this report on form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which involve known and unknown risks

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currency 
the company employs various financial instruments to manage certain exposures when practical 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company owns and operates three natural foods supermarkets and a commissary kitchen in british columbia  canada 
the commissary supports the three canadian stores and does not independently generate sales revenue 
sales made from the canadian stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars 
to the extent that those revenues are repatriated to the united states  the amounts repatriated are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations between the two currencies 
the company does not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt issued under its million revolving credit facility 
the facility has two separate lines of credit  a revolving line of up to million and a term loan of up to million  each with a three year term expiring august  as part of the october amendment of the credit facility  which had an original credit capacity of million  borrowings under the credit facility have been limited to million 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the million revolving line of this facility and million in borrowings outstanding under the million term note 
as part of the amendment to the credit facility  the interest rate on the facility was amended to either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates increase by starting january  and each six months thereafter through january because the interest rates on these facilities are variable  based upon the prime rate or libor  the company s interest expense and net income are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding debt as of december   would be an annual increase or decrease of approximately million in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of approximately  in the company s net income after taxes 
in september  as required by the company s credit facility  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure on variable rate debt positions 
variable rates are predominantly linked to libor as determined by one month intervals 
the interest rate provided by the swap on variable rate debt is 
at december   the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement was million  expiring in august the notional amount is the amount used for the calculation of interest payments which are exchanged over the life of the swap transaction on the amortized principal balance 
in fiscal  the loss  net of taxes  included in other comprehensive loss for this cash flow hedge was approximately million
