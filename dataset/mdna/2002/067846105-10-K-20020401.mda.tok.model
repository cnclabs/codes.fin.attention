recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires that  upon adoption of sfas  the company reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas requires the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
the company is also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas the company s previous business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method 
as of december   the net carrying amount of goodwill is  amortization expense during the year ended december  was  however  the goodwill balance as of december  reflects the amount expected to be recovered from anticipated cash flows from investments

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 and portions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this new standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
the company believes the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on the company s financial position and operating results
