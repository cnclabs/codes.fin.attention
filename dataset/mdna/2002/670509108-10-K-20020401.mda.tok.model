item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we began operations in as an independent oil and gas company and have grown through a series of acquisitions of oil and gas properties and the subsequent exploitation and development of these properties  and complemented these efforts with divestitures of non core assets and an exploration program 
results of operations our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
success in acquiring oil and gas properties and our ability to maintain or increase production through exploitation activities has also significantly affected our operating results

it is presented solely to improve the understanding of the impact of the charges 
revenues oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues increased to million in from million in principally due to higher commodity prices and lower hedging losses during  partially offset by lower production 
the realized oil price in was per bbl  an increase of per bbl from oil production averaged mbbls per day  a decrease of mbbls per day due to an eight month curtailment of steaming operations in california as well as production shut ins for facility repairs in our hedging losses were million in and million in natural gas production averaged mmcf per day in  declining from mmcf per day in the decline was due to lower domestic production onshore in the gulf coast and offshore california 
the realized natural gas price was per mcf  which increased from per mcf in gain on sale of assets 
our net gain from the sales of assets for was million  primarily related to the gain from our sale of real estate in brea  california of million 
the net gain on sale of assets for was million primarily representing a million gain on the sale of our working interest in the las cienagas field in california 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for of million includes million of interest income on the overnight investment of excess cash and a gain on derivatives of million 
interest and other income for of million includes million in interest income resulting from higher cash balances in plus million for a partial reimbursement of previously expensed funds  resulting from a negotiated settlement of a legal claim  as well as several individually insignificant items costs and expenses excluding non recurring items costs and expenses 
lease operating expenses loe for totaled million  as compared to million for the increase in loe from to is primarily due to a increase in gas prices in compared to we use gas as a feedstock to generate steam which is injected into reservoirs to facilitate the production of heavy california oil 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  dry hole costs and delay rentals  were million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to million of dry hole costs associated with non commercial wells drilled onshore california 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in due to higher depletion rates which were primarily driven by a lower reserve base 
general and administrative expense of million in was comparable to interest expense 
interest expense of million in increased compared to interest expense of million in the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of interest for our senior subordinated notes issued in september  offset by a decrease in the use of a line of credit and an increase of interest capitalized 
dividends 
dividends on the tecons were million in and the tecons pay dividends at a rate of and were issued in december see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit 
we had an income tax benefit of million in compared to an expense of million in our effective income tax rate was in and in non recurring items impairments 
during  we recorded an impairment totaling million on our santa clara  huntington beach  pitas point  masseko and point pedernales fields and certain other oil and gas properties 
sfas no 
requires an impairment loss be recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows 
we recognized an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of an oil and gas property equals the present value of expected future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves  utilizing a risk adjusted rate of return 
we had no impairments in see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring 
we incurred million of restructuring charges in related to the termination of two outsourcing contracts and the reorganization of our exploration and production operations 
these costs included termination fees and severance 
we had no such costs in see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on assets held for sale 
in  we made the decision not to proceed with our power plant project in santa barbara and kern county california and transferred our remaining equipment to assets held for sale and recorded a million loss representing the write down to estimated fair market value less estimated costs to sell these assets of million 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other 
we had other non recurring income and expenses of million in which were primarily related to the termination of hedging contracts with enron  the reversal of a royalty refund claim  insurance costs related to business interruption and various consulting and legal costs 
we had no such costs in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues oil and gas revenues for were higher than oil and gas revenues primarily due to a increase in average realized oil prices and a increase in average realized gas prices from to partially offsetting these increases in realized prices  our gas production decreased from to  and oil production decreased from to the production decreases were primarily a result of asset sales 
gain on sale of assets 
the net gain on sale of assets for was million  primarily representing a million gain on the sale of our las cienegas field in california  partially offset by a million net loss on the sale of several individually insignificant non core assets 
the net gain on sale of assets for was million  which is comprised of an million gain on the sale of our east texas natural gas assets in january  a million gain on the sale of our interest in onshore fields and a gas processing plant located in ventura county  california  in december  and a million net loss on the sale of other non core properties 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for the year ended december   of million includes million in interest income resulting from higher cash balances in plus million for a partial reimbursement of previously expensed funds  resulting from a negotiated settlement of a legal claim see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income for the year ended december   of million includes million associated with interest earned on the million in proceeds from the sale of the east texas natural gas properties funded into an escrow account to provide like kind exchange tax treatment in the event we acquired domestic producing oil and gas properties in the first half of the escrow account was liquidated in june  in connection with our june acquisition of certain california oil and gas properties from texaco  inc and the repayment of a portion of bank debt 
also included in interest and other income in is million related to the sale of an unconsolidated subsidiary 
costs and expenses costs and expenses 
loe for totaled million  as compared to million for the increase in loe from to is primarily due to a million increase in steam costs resulting from higher natural gas prices 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical g g costs  dry hole costs and delay rentals  were million and million for the years ended december  and exploration costs for the year ended included million of dry hole costs  million of g g costs  million of delay rentals and million of other exploration costs 
exploration costs for the year ended included million of dry hole costs million of which relates to onshore california  million of g g costs million of which relates to ghana  million of delay rentals and million of other exploration costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased in as compared to this decrease was driven by a lower depletion rate  which primarily resulted from a significant increase in reserve estimates attributable to higher commodity prices at year end versus year end general and administrative expenses increased only slightly in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense of million for year ended december   increased as compared to interest expense in the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during the year plus higher interest rates on those outstanding borrowings 
on september   all borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were paid off with net proceeds received from our issuance of the notes see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase is also due to higher interest rates as we exchanged our senior subordinated notes due for senior subordinated notes due in the third quarter of other expense 
other expense of million in includes a million settlement for a lawsuit see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  million for scientific information technology consulting  and million in costs to evaluate potential business transactions 
other expense of million in includes million in third party charges incurred in connection with the july exchange offer see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  million relating to the fraud discussed below  million for scientific information technology consulting  and other miscellaneous charges

dividends 
dividends on the tecons were million in and the tecons pay dividends at a rate of and were issued in december income tax expense 
income tax expense of million was recognized in  compared to a benefit of million in our effective income tax rate was and in and at december   we determined that it was more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets would be realized  based on commodity prices at year end  and the valuation allowance was decreased by million 
change in accounting principle 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission announced that commodity inventories should be carried at the lower of cost or market rather than at market value 
as a result  we changed our inventory valuation method to the lower of cost or market in the fourth quarter of  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to earnings  effective january   of million net of the related income tax benefit of million to value product inventory at the lower of cost or market 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity we have grown and diversified our operations through a series of disciplined  low cost acquisitions of oil and gas properties and the subsequent exploitation and development of these properties 
we have historically funded our operations and acquisitions with operating cash flows  bank financing  private and public placements of debt and equity securities  property divestitures and joint ventures with industry participants 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and we invested million  million and million in oil and gas properties in  and additionally  we spent million  million and million on gas plant and other facilities in  and in january  we acquired a producing property in california for million 
in june  we acquired working interests in oil and gas properties located onshore and offshore california for million from texaco inc texaco 
to purchase these assets  we used funds from a million interest bearing escrow account that was created with proceeds from our january sale of our east texas natural gas assets 
following the texaco transaction  the million remaining in the escrow account  which included million of interest income  was used to repay a portion of outstanding bank debt in early july we believe our working capital  cash flow from operations and available financing sources are sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due and to finance our capital budget through under our credit agreement which provides for secured revolving credit  we have a million borrowing base with million available at december  and had drawn million under the agreement 
in late december and early january  we entered into interest rate swaps totaling million  million on our notes and million on our notes

these notes have not been redeemed  in whole or in part  at december  we are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to these notes and they are unsecured general obligations  and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
operating leases we have operating leases in the normal course of business  which include those for office space and operating facilities and office and operating equipment  with varying terms from to at december   our total commitments under operating leases were approximately million 
minimum annual rental commitments at december   were as follows operating leases in thousands thereafter  total  capital commitments at december   we had capital commitments of million primarily relating to our international oil and gas exploration and development activity 
our other planned capital projects are discretionary in nature  with no substantial capital commitments made in advance of the actual expenditures 
commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments by date of expiration 
each of these commitments is discussed in further detail below amount of commitment expiration per period total less amounts than after committed year years years years in thousands bank credit facility   letters of credit total commercial commitments   lines of credit bank credit facility 
our third amended and restated credit agreement  dated june   provides for secured revolving credit availability of up to million from a bank group led by bank of america  na  bank one  na  and bank of montreal until its expiration on june  the borrowing base is subject to a semi annual borrowing base determination within days following march and august of each year and establishes the maximum borrowings that may be outstanding under the credit facility 
it is determined by a vote of the banks two thirds in the event of an increase in the borrowing base  each of which bases its judgement on i the present value of our oil and gas reserves based on their own assumptions regarding future prices  production  costs  risk factors and discount rates  and ii projected cash flow coverage ratios calculated under varying scenarios 
if amounts outstanding under the credit facility exceed the borrowing base  as redetermined from time to time  we would be required to repay such excess over a defined period of time 
we have a million borrowing base under our credit facility with million available at december  and had drawn million under the agreement 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus an amount which increases as the indebtedness to capitalization as defined under the credit agreement increases 
letters of credits we had one letter of credit outstanding at december  in the amount of million  which expires in february contingencies and other matters legal proceedings on september   during an annual inspection  we discovered fractures in the heat affected zone of certain flanges on our pipeline that connects the point pedernales field with onshore processing facilities 
we voluntarily elected to shut in production in the field while repairs were being made 
the daily net production from this field was approximately  barrels of crude oil and mmcf of natural gas  representing approximately of our daily production 
we replaced the damaged flanges  as well as others which had not shown signs of damage 
the cost of repair is expected to be partially covered by insurance 
we may have exposure to costs that may not be recoverable from insurance  including those associated with the repair of undamaged equipment 
production was back on in january on june   we experienced a failure of a carbon dioxide treatment vessel at the rincon onshore separation facility rosf located in ventura county  california 
there were no injuries associated with this event and the cause of the failure is under investigation 
crude oil and natural gas produced from three fields offshore california are transported onshore by pipeline to the rosf plant where crude oil and water are separated and treated  and carbon dioxide is removed from the natural gas stream 
the daily net production associated with these fields is  barrels of crude oil and mmcf of natural gas  representing approximately of our daily production 
crude oil production resumed in early july and full gas sales resumed by mid august 
the cost of repair  less a  deductible  is expected to be covered by insurance 
we may have exposure to costs that may not be recoverable from insurance 
on september   we were named as a defendant in the lawsuit thomas wachtell et al 
versus nuevo energy company in the superior court of los angeles county  california 
we successfully removed this lawsuit to the united states district court for the central district of california 
the plaintiffs  who own certain interests in the point pedernales properties  have asserted numerous causes of action including breach of contract  fraud and conspiracy in connection with the plaintiff s allegation that 
royalties have not been properly paid to them for production from the point pedernales field  
payments have not been made to them related to production from the pescado and sacate fields  and  
we have failed to recognize the plaintiff s interests in the tranquillon ridge project 
the plaintiffs have not specified damages 
we intend to vigorously contest these claims 
on april   we filed a lawsuit against exxonmobil corporation in the united states district court for the central district of california  western division 
the company and exxonmobil each own a interest in the sacate field  offshore santa barbara county  california 
we have alleged that by grossly inflating the fee that exxonmobil insists we must pay to use an existing exxonmobil platform and production infrastructure  exxonmobil failed to submit a proposal for the development of the sacate field consistent with the unit operating agreement 
we  therefore believe that we have been denied a reasonable opportunity to exercise our rights under the unit operating agreement 
we have alleged that exxonmobil s actions breach the unit operating agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
we are seeking damages and a declaratory judgment as to the payment that must be made to access exxonmobil s platform and facilities 
we have been named as a defendant in certain other lawsuits incidental to our business 
management does not believe that the outcome of such litigation will have a material adverse impact on our operating results  financial condition or liquidity above the amounts we have reserved to cover any potential losses 
however  these actions and claims in the aggregate seek substantial damages against us and are subject to the inherent uncertainties in any litigation 
we are defending ourselves vigorously in all such matters 
in march  it was discovered that a non officer employee had fraudulently authorized and diverted  for personal use  company funds of million  million in and the remainder in  that were intended for international exploration 
the board of directors engaged a certified fraud examiner to conduct an in depth review of the fraudulent transactions 
the investigation confirmed that only one employee was involved in the matter and that all misappropriated funds were identified 
we have reviewed and  where appropriate  strengthened our internal control procedures 
in august  we recorded million of other income for a partial reimbursement of these previously expensed funds  resulting from the negotiated settlement of a related legal claim 
in september  there was a spill of crude oil into the santa barbara channel from a pipeline that connects our point pedernales field with shore based processing facilities 
the volume of the spill was estimated to be bbls of oil 
repairs were completed by the end of and production recommenced in december the costs of the clean up and the cost to repair the pipeline either have been or are expected to be covered by our insurance  less a deductible of million 
we incurred clean up and repair costs of million  million and million during  and as of december   we had received insurance reimbursements of million  with a remaining insurance receivable of million 
for amounts not covered by insurance  including the million deductible  we recorded lease operating expenses of million in and million during no such expenses were recorded in we also have exposure to costs that may not be recoverable from insurance  including certain fines  penalties  and damages and certain legal fees 
such costs are not quantifiable at this time  but are not expected to be material to our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
our international investments involve risks typically associated with investments in emerging markets such as an uncertain political  economic  legal and tax environment and expropriation and nationalization of assets 
in addition  if a dispute arises in our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the united states 
we attempt to conduct our business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where we operate  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in so protecting ourselves 
a portion of our investment in the congo is insured through political risk insurance provided by the overseas private investment corporation opic 
the political risk insurance through opic covers up to million relating to expropriation and political violence  which is the maximum coverage available through opic 
we have no deductible for this insurance 
in connection with our february acquisitions of two subsidiaries each a congo subsidiary owning interests in the yombo field offshore congo  we and a wholly owned subsidiary of cms nomeco oil gas co 
cms agreed with the seller of the subsidiaries not to claim certain tax losses dual consolidated losses incurred by such subsidiaries prior to the acquisitions 
under the tax law in the congo  as it existed when this acquisition took place  if an entity is acquired in its entirety and that entity has certain tax attributes  for example tax loss carryforwards from operations in the republic of congo  the subsequent owners of that entity can continue to utilize those losses without restriction 
pursuant to the agreement  we and cms may be liable to the seller for the recapture of dual consolidated losses net operating losses of any domestic corporation that are subject to an income tax of a foreign country without regard to the source of its income or on a residence basis utilized by the seller in years prior to the acquisitions if certain triggering events occur  including 
a disposition by either us or cms of our respective congo subsidiary  
either congo subsidiary s sale of its interest in the yombo field  
the acquisition of us or cms by another consolidated group or 
the failure of cms s congo subsidiary or us to continue as a member of its respective consolidated group 
a triggering event will not occur  however  if a subsequent purchaser enters into certain agreements specified in the consolidated return regulations intended to ensure that such dual consolidated losses will not be claimed 
the only time limit associated with the occurrence of a triggering event relates to the utilization of a dual consolidated loss in a foreign jurisdiction 
a dual consolidated loss that is utilized to offset income in a foreign jurisdiction is only subject to recapture for years following the year in which the dual consolidated loss was incurred for us income tax purposes 
we and cms have agreed among ourselves that the party responsible for the triggering event shall indemnify the other for any liability to the seller as a result of such triggering event 
our potential direct liability could be as much as million if a triggering event with respect to us occurs 
additionally  we believe that cms s liability for which we would be jointly liable with an indemnification right against cms could be as much as million 
we do not expect a triggering event to occur with respect to us or cms and do not believe the agreement will have a material adverse effect upon us 
during  a new government was established in the congo 
although the political situation in the congo has not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations in the congo  no assurances can be made that continued political unrest in west africa will not have a material adverse effect on us or our operations in the congo in the future 
in  the previous congo government requested that the convention governing the marine exploitation permit be converted to a production sharing agreement psa 
preliminary discussions were held with the government in early we are under no obligation to convert to a psa  and our existing convention is valid and protected by law 
our position is that any conversion to a psa would have no detrimental impact to us  otherwise  we will not agree to any such conversion 
the new government established in the congo in has recently begun discussions with us and our partner concerning the conversion to a psa 
discussions with the new government are ongoing and  to date  no agreement has been reached concerning conversion to a psa 
contingent payment and price sharing agreements in connection with the acquisition from unocal in of the properties located in california  we are obligated to make a contingent payment for the years through if oil prices exceed thresholds set forth in the agreement with unocal 
any contingent payment will be accounted for as a purchase price adjustment to oil and gas properties 
the contingent payment will equal of the difference between the actual average annual price received on a field by field basis capped by a maximum price and a minimum price  less ad valorem and production taxes  multiplied by the actual number of barrels of oil sold that are produced from the properties acquired from unocal during the respective year 
the minimum price of per bbl under the agreement determined based on the near month delivery of wti crude oil on the nymex is escalated at per year and the maximum price of per bbl on the nymex is escalated at per year 
minimum and maximum prices are reduced to reflect the field level price by subtracting a fixed differential established for each field 
the reduction was established at approximately the differential between actual sales prices and nymex prices in effect in per bbl weighted average for all the properties acquired from unocal 
we accumulate credits to offset the contingent payment when prices are 
per bbl or more below the minimum price 
we paid million to unocal under this agreement on march  in connection with the acquisition of the congo properties in  we entered into a price sharing agreement with the seller 
there is no termination date associated with this agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  if the average price received for the oil production during the year is greater than the benchmark price established by the agreement  we are obligated to pay the seller of the difference between the benchmark price and the actual price received  for all the barrels associated with this acquisition 
the benchmark price was per bbl for  per bbl for and per bbl for the benchmark price increases each year  based on the increase in the consumer price index 
for  the effect of this agreement was that we only owned upside above per bbl on approximately of our congo production 
we were obligated to pay the seller million in and million in under this price sharing agreement 
this obligation was accounted for as a reduction in oil revenues 
no payment was due in we acquired a working interest in the point pedernales oil field from unocal in and the remainder of our working interest from torch in we are entitled to all revenue proceeds up to per bbl  with the excess revenue over per bbl  if any  shared with the original owners from whom torch acquired its interest 
we own amounts below per bbl with the other working interest owners based on their respective ownership interests 
for  the effect of this agreement is that we were entitled to receive the pricing upside above per bbl on approximately of the gross point pedernales production 
as of december   we had million accrued as our obligation under this agreement 
as of december   we had million accrued as our obligation under this agreement 
as of december   we had million accrued as our obligation under this agreement 
critical accounting policies oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method to account for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under successful efforts  oil and gas lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs associated with exploration efforts that result in the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated with development drilling  whether or not successful  are capitalized when incurred 
when a proved property is sold  ceases to produce or is abandoned  a gain or loss is recognized 
when an entire interest in an unproved property is sold for cash or cash equivalent  a gain or loss is recognized  taking into consideration any recorded impairment 
when a partial interest in an unproved property is sold  the amount received is treated as a reduction of the cost of the interest retained 
unproved leasehold costs are capitalized pending the results of exploration efforts 
significant unproved leasehold costs are reviewed periodically and a loss is recognized to the extent  if any  that the cost of the property has been impaired 
exploration costs  including g g expenses  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and proved leases are capitalized and depleted on a unit of production basis over the remaining proved reserves 
capitalized drilling costs are depleted on a unit of production basis over the remaining proved developed reserves 
total estimated costs of million net of salvage value for future dismantlement  abandonment and site remediation are included when calculating depreciation and depletion using the unit of production method 
at december   we had recorded million as a component of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved oil and gas properties accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting  on a depletable unit basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
sfas no 
requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows from proved reserves  utilizing a risk adjusted rate of return 
due to low commodity prices in the fourth quarter of  we estimated the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compared such undiscounted future net cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount was recoverable 
for some of our oil and gas properties  the carrying amount of the properties exceeded the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows  thus  we adjusted the carrying amount of the respective oil and gas properties to their fair value as determined by discounting their estimated future net cash flows 
the factors used to determine fair value included  but were not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity prices  timing of future production  future capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with our internal rate of return on our oil and gas properties 
as a result  we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of million million after tax related to the impairment of oil and gas properties in recognition of crude oil and natural gas revenue crude oil and natural gas revenues are recognized when title passes to the purchaser 
we use the entitlement method for recording sales of crude oil and natural gas from producing wells 
under the entitlement method  revenue is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production 
deliveries of crude oil and natural gas in excess of our net revenue interests are recorded as liabilities and under deliveries are recorded as assets 
production imbalances are recorded at the lower of the sales price in effect at the time of production or the current market value 
substantially all such amounts are anticipated to be settled with production in future periods 
we did not have a material imbalance position in terms of units or value at december  or approximately million  million and million is included as oil and gas revenues and operating expenses related to gas production used in our steam injection projects in  and derivative financial instruments we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective january  which requires all derivative instruments to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a cumulative effect transition adjustment of million  net of related tax benefit of million  in other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments at the date of adoption 
beginning on january   all of our derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we currently use swaps and options to hedge our exposure to material changes in the future price of crude oil and interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of our long term debt 
on the date the derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as either a hedge of fair value of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge  as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received cash flow hedge  or as a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as  and that is designated and qualifies as  a fair value hedge  along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk including losses or gains on firm commitments  are recorded in current period earnings 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
at december   we had both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet  with changes in its fair value recognized in earnings prospectively 
at december   we had recorded million  net of related taxes of million  of cumulative hedging gains in other comprehensive income  which will be reclassified to earnings within the next months 
the amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will vary due to changes in the fair value of the open derivative contracts prior to settlement 
as a result of hedging transactions  oil and gas revenues were reduced by million  million and million in  and the portion of our hedging transactions that were ineffective totaled million in and was recorded in interest and other income 
price risk management activities we use price risk management activities to manage non trading market risks 
we use derivative financial instruments such as swaps and put options to hedge the impact of market price risk exposure on our crude oil and natural gas production and to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for asset retirement obligations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their business 
the liability is discounted to its present value  and the related asset value is increased by the amount of the resulting liability 
over the life of the asset  the liability will be accreted to its future value and eventually extinguished when the asset is taken out of service 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effects of this pronouncement 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of historical net book value or fair value less cost to sell 
the standard also expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted the provisions of this statement effective january  and this statement does not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

volatility of oil and gas prices prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign oil imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves  borrowing capacity  our ability to obtain additional capital  and our revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
pricing of heavy oil production a portion of our production is california heavy oil 
the market price for california heavy oil differs substantially from the established market indices for oil and gas  principally due to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
as a result  the price received for heavy oil is generally lower than the price for medium and light oil  and the production costs associated with heavy oil are relatively higher than for lighter grades 
the margin sales price minus production costs on heavy oil sales is generally less than that of lighter oil  and the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil 
see hedging below for discussion of year crude oil contract 
reserve replacement risks our future performance depends upon the ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
without successful exploration  exploitation or acquisition activities  our reserves and revenues will decline 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
the successful acquisition and development of oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors 
such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
in addition  no assurances can be given that our exploitation and development activities will result in any increase in reserves 
our operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of lack of adequate capital and other factors  such as title problems  weather  compliance with governmental regulations or price controls  mechanical difficulties or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
in addition  the costs of exploitation and development may materially exceed initial estimates 
substantial capital requirements we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the exploitation  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and gas reserves 
historically  these expenditures were financed with cash generated by operations  proceeds from bank borrowings and the proceeds of debt and equity issuances 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit facility to fund planned capital expenditures 
if revenues or our borrowing base decreases as a result of lower oil and gas prices  operating difficulties or declines in reserves  we may have limited ability to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
uncertainty of estimates of reserves and future net cash flows estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  all of which are to some degree speculative and may vary considerably from actual results 
therefore  actual production  revenues  taxes  and development and operating expenditures may not occur as estimated 
future results of operations will depend upon our ability to develop  produce and sell our oil and gas reserves 
the reserve data included herein are estimates only and are subject to many uncertainties 
actual quantities of oil and gas may differ considerably from the amounts set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data 
operating risks our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  such as blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  earthquakes and other environmental risks 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations 
our offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions  to more extensive governmental regulation  including regulations that may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for pollution damage  and to interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental or other considerations 
our operations could result in liability for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
we could be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred  the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain insurance coverage for our operations  including limited coverage for sudden environmental damages and for existing contamination  but do not believe that insurance coverage for environmental damages that occur over time or insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost  and we may be subject to liability or may lose substantial portions of our properties in the event of certain environmental damages 
california natural gas and electricity markets the price of natural gas and the threat of electrical disruptions are factors that create volatility in our california oil and gas operations 
because of the recent developments in these commodities  we have made significant changes in our natural gas disposition and electricity production in california 
regarding natural gas  we have historically had a net long position in california producing more natural gas than consumed in thermal crude production 
moreover  as gas prices escalated in late  we began to exploit this gas position by diverting gas consumed in less economic cyclic steaming operations to gas sales 
in january and february  we sold an average of mmcf per day  or of our total daily gas production  which resulted in an increase in gas sales of 
as natural gas prices moderated later in  we resumed the use of previously diverted natural gas in our steam operations 
in california  we generate a total of megawatts mw of power at various sites 
in  two turbines came on line at our brea olinda field using gas previously flared 
three turbines in kern county produce mw of power and cogenerate of our total steam needs in thermal operation 
by self generating power consumption in kern county  we have reduced our exposure to rising electricity prices 
with the exception of the point pedernales field  for which we have contracted for firm electric power service  our facilities receive power under interruptible service contracts 
considering the fact that california has experienced shortages of electricity and some of our facilities receive interruptible service  we could experience periodic power interruptions 
in addition  the state of california could change existing rules or impose new rules or regulations with respect to power that could impact our operating costs 
foreign investments our foreign investments involve risks typically associated with investments in emerging markets such as uncertain political  economic  legal and tax environments and expropriation and nationalization of assets 
we attempt to conduct our business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where we operate  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting against such risks 
our international assets and operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including  among other things  the risks of war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  changing political conditions  international monetary fluctuations  currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
in addition  if a dispute arises with foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons  especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies  to the jurisdiction of the united states 
our private ownership of oil and gas reserves under oil and gas leases in the united states differs distinctly from our ownership of foreign oil and gas properties 
in the foreign countries in which we do business  the state generally retains ownership of the minerals and consequently retains control of and in many cases  participates in the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves 
accordingly  operations outside the united states  and estimates of reserves attributable to properties located outside the united states  may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments  export taxes and regulations  surcharges  value added taxes  production bonuses and other charges 
hedging we reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in a typical swap transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparty the difference 
we would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether our production was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
in addition  the index used to calculate the floating price in a hedge is frequently not the same as the prices actually received for the production hedged 
the difference referred to as basis differential may be material  and may reduce the benefit or increase the detriment caused by a particular hedge 
there is not an established pricing index for hedges of california heavy crude oil production  and the cash market for heavy oil production in california tends to vary widely from index prices typically used in oil hedges 
consequently  prior to  hedging california heavy crude oil was particularly subject to the risks associated with volatile basis differentials 
in february  we entered into a year contract  effective january   to sell substantially all of our current and future california crude oil production to tosco corporation 
the contract provides pricing based on a fixed percentage of the nymex crude oil price for each type of crude oil that we produce in california 
therefore  the actual price received as a percentage of nymex will vary with our production mix 
based on our current production mix  the price we receive for our california oil production is expected to average approximately of wti 
while the contract does not reduce our exposure to price volatility  it does effectively eliminate the basis differential risk between the nymex price and the field price of our california oil production  thereby facilitating the ability to effectively hedge our realized prices 
as a result of hedging transactions  oil and gas revenues were reduced by million  million and million in  and insurance as a result of the september  terrorist attack  the ability to secure certain insurance coverages at prices that we consider reasonable may be impacted and other coverages or endorsements may not be made available 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to duplicate our current insurance package when our policies come up for renewal 
risk management policy our risk management policy is based on the view that oil prices revert to a mean price over the long term 
to the extent that future markets over a forward month period are significantly higher than long term norms  we will hedge production volumes up to certain maximums set forth in our oil hedging policy approved by our board in march maximum hedged volumes increase as the price of oil increases 
variations from this policy require board approval 
the risk management policy states that hedging activity that is speculative or otherwise unrelated to our normal business activities is considered inappropriate 
we recognize the risks inherent in price management 
in order to minimize such risk  we have instituted a set of controls addressing approval authority  trading limits and other control procedures 
all hedging activity is the responsibility of our senior vice president of planning and asset management 
in addition  internal audit  which independently reports to the audit committee  reviews our price management activity 
competition markets for production we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration  exploitation  development and production 
the availability of funds and information relating to a property  the minimum projected return on investment  the availability of alternate fuel sources and the intermediate transportation of oil and gas are factors which affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 
our competitors include major integrated oil companies and a substantial number of independent energy companies  many of which possess greater financial and other resources than we do 
our heavy crude oil production in california requires special processing treatment available only from a limited number of refineries 
substantial damage to such a refinery or closures or reductions in capacity due to financial or other factors could adversely affect the market for our heavy crude oil production 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
we produce and sell crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids therefore our operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces 
we reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  put options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in a typical swap transaction  if the floating price is less than the fixed price  we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparty the difference 
in a typical put option contract  we purchase the right to receive from the counterparty the difference  if any  between a fixed price specified in the option less a floating market price 
if the floating price is above the fixed price  we are not entitled to a payment 
quantities covered by these hedges are based on west texas intermediate wti barrels 
our production is expected to average of wti  therefore  each wti barrel effectively hedges barrels of our production 
we use hedge accounting for these instruments  and settlements of gains or losses on these contracts are reported as a component of oil and gas revenues and operating cash flows in the period realized 
these agreements expose us to counterparty credit risk to the extent that the counterparty is unable to meet their settlement commitments to us 
at december   we had entered into the following cash flow hedges average wti barrels strike per day price swaps first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  put options second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  at december   the fair market value of these hedge positions is million  net of the cost of the options of million 
a increase in the underlying commodity prices would reduce this gain by million 
subsequent to december   we entered into the following swap agreements average wti barrels strike per day price second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  interest rate risk 
we may enter into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
in late december  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million to hedge the fair value of our notes due and our notes due these swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are reflected as a reduction of long term debt of million as of december   with a correlating increase in long term liabilities 
under the terms of the agreements for the notes  the counterparty pays us a weighted average fixed annual rate of on total notional amounts of million  and we pay the counterparty a variable annual rate equal to the six month libor rate plus a weighted average rate of 
under the terms of the agreement for the notes  the counterparty pays us a weighted average fixed annual rate of on total notional amounts of million  and we pay the counterparty a variable annual rate equal to the six month libor rate plus a weighted average rate of 
subsequent to december   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount totaling million to hedge the fair value of our notes 
under the terms of this agreement  the counterparty pays us a weighted average fixed annual rate of on the notional amount of million  and we pay the counterparty a variable annual rate equal to the three month libor rate plus a weighted average rate of 
the following table presents principal amounts and the related average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations at december  fair value thereafter total liability in thousands  except percentages long term debt variable rate    average interest rate
