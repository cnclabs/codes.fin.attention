item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of swimming pool equipment  parts and supplies  including chemicals  cleaners  packaged pools and liners  filters  heaters  pumps  lights  repair parts and other equipment required to build  maintain  install and overhaul residential and small commercial swimming pools 
in and  the company significantly increased the breadth of complementary products offered including building materials  electrical supplies  toys and games  water features such as fountains  and hand tools 
the company sells its products primarily to swimming pool remodelers and builders  independent swimming pool retailers and swimming pool repair and service companies

this network has certain exclusive suppliers  product relationships and marketing programs 
the company adopted an operating strategy of offering two distinct national distribution choices to customers in order to promote internal competition to further the value provided by its service centers 
the swimming pool supply industry is affected by various factors including weather  general economic conditions  consumer saving and discretionary spending levels  the rate of new housing construction and consumer attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons 
although management believes that the company s geographic diversity and the continuing required maintenance and repair of existing swimming pools could mitigate the effect of an economic downturn or regional adverse weather conditions  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations and expansion plans would not be materially adversely affected by any of such circumstances 
the principal components of the company s expenses include the cost of products purchased for resale and operating expenses which are primarily related to labor  occupancy  marketing  selling and administrative expenses 
in response to competitive pressures from any of its current or future competitors  the company may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share  and such measures could adversely affect the company s gross margins and operating results 
same store sales and gross profit growth are calculated using a month convention whereby all newly opened  acquired or consolidated service centers and all existing service centers in the immediate market areas of the aforementioned service centers are excluded from the calculation for a period of months 
same store sales growth was in compared to in and in the same store sales growth trend was adversely affected in primarily by unfavorable weather throughout most of the year 
the pool season experienced a slow start with extended cold weather in the north and unusually wet conditions in the south 
mild temperatures in the north during the summer months further aggravated the season s slow start  while a stagnant tropical system shut down the pool business in the south central united states for two weeks in june  which is typically the most active sales month

same store gross profit growth of nearly contributed million to the increase  while new service centers accounted for the remaining increase 
the increase in same store gross profit growth is attributable to several factors including a increase in same store sales improvements in pricing accuracy and greater pricing discipline at the point of sale a continued focus on a preferred vendor program initiated in whereby service centers are encouraged to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors in order to effect more efficient purchasing and inventory management increased sales of complementary products that typically have gross margins equal to or higher than the company s average the utilization of centralized shipping locations which purchase slower turning inventories such as parts in bulk quantities and then redistribute products to service centers scp pool corporation part ii

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is highly seasonal 
weather is the principal external factor affecting the company s business 
hot  dry weather can increase the purchase of chemicals and supplies for existing pools and stimulate increased purchases of above ground pools 
unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts of rainfall during the peak selling season can decrease pool installations and the purchase of chemicals and supplies 
in addition  unseasonably early or late warming trends can increase or decrease the length of the pool season and  consequently  the company s sales 
in general  sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when the company may incur net losses 
in  approximately of the company s net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use  installation  remodeling and repair  and approximately of the company s operating income was generated in the same period 
the company typically experiences a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season 
the company s peak borrowing occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by the company s suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while the company s peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
the company expects that its quarterly results of operations will fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new service centers and acquisitions 
the company attempts to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for and  which  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of such data

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ significantly from management s expectations 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has identified the following four accounting policies that management believes are the most critical in presenting fairly the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and typically does not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  receivables are generally due within days except sales under early buy programs for which extended payment terms are provided to qualified customers 
the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april  may and june or may and june  depending on geographical location 
credit losses have been historically within management s expectations 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including aging statistics and trends customer payment history independent credit reports discussions with customers based on historical information and management s analysis of current trends  the company accrues for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of net sales 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s likely inability to meet their financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for uncollectible accounts 
for all other customers  the company provides reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from for amounts currently due to for amounts more than days past due 
if the balance in the company s more than days past due category of its accounts receivable aging was to increase from the balance at december   pretax income would decrease by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  inventory obsolescence and shrink reserve in evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrink  management considers a combination of factors including the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales level by product  including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels changes in customer preferences the experience of the service center manager the previous inventory management performance of the service center geographical location new product offerings scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued the reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the above identified factors 
the company believes its greatest exposure to inventory obsolescence is inventory that typically turns three times or less per year but which the company must have in stock in order to maintain a high level of customer service 
the company provides a reserve of for such inventory 
for each basis point difference between the company s actual experience and the reserve provided  pretax income would change by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  at december   the company s product inventories balance was approximately million higher than typically required at the end of the year 
in the fourth quarter  the company made accelerated early buy purchases to take advantage of purchase discounts offered by vendors in order to reduce their own inventory levels 
such purchases consisted mainly of high velocity whole goods such as pumps  filters  heaters and cleaners  thus the company does not expect there to be additional risk of obsolescence associated with these early buy purchases 
revenue recognition service centers are located near customer concentrations  typically in industrial  commercial or mixed use zones 
customers may procure products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via the company s trucks or third party carriers 
the company recognizes revenue when customers take delivery of products 
products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
the company may offer volume rebates  which are accrued monthly as an adjustment to net sales 
additionally  in certain markets  the company may offer discount terms of  net days 
customer returns  including those associated with early buy programs  have been historically immaterial and are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
goodwill at december   the company had a net goodwill balance of million  representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 
this balance includes million of net goodwill that arose at the time the company was established in in a leveraged buyout transaction 
the remaining goodwill has arisen in connection with subsequent acquisitions 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which established a new method of testing goodwill for impairment using a fair value based approach and does not permit amortization of goodwill as was previously required 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  the company completed its transitional goodwill impairment test as required under sfas no 
and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
this transitional test required comparison of the company s estimated fair value at january  to its book value  including goodwill 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the company below its book value 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the company has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a component of operating income 
liquidity and capital resources on november   the company prepaid its existing senior loan facility the former credit facility and entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of banks 
the credit agreement  which matures on november   permits the company to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement has an accordion feature that permits the company to increase the revolving credit facility to million at the company s option 
during the twelve months ended december   the company received net proceeds of million under its revolving credit facility and former credit facility 
as of december   the company had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may  at the company s option  bear interest at either i the agent s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus  whichever is higher  plus a margin ranging from to or ii the current eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on the company s leverage ratio 
substantially all of the assets of the company  including the capital stock of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  secure the company s obligations under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has numerous restrictive covenants  which require the company to maintain a minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage and which also restrict the company s ability to pay dividends and make capital expenditures 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants and financial ratio requirements 
the effective interest rate of the revolving credit facility was at december  at december   the company s contractual obligations of long term debt and operating leases were as follows payments due by period contractual less than years and obligations total year years years thereafter long term debt   operating leases      currently  the company s primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings are used to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the company s borrowings  together with cash from operations and seller financing  historically have been sufficient to support the company s growth and to finance acquisitions 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in  primarily due to a million increase in net income 
in  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million from million in a million increase in net income was offset by substantial product inventory purchases made in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarters of and  the company made advance payments to vendors of approximately million and million  respectively  for accelerated product inventory purchases 
these purchases allowed the company to take advantage of vendor programs whereby manufacturers offer purchase discounts to reduce their own inventory levels 
such purchases consisted mainly of high velocity whole goods such as pumps  filters  heaters and cleaners 
the purchase discounts offered by the company s vendors are greater than the costs incurred to handle  store and finance the inventory 
the million purchase price of the hughes acquisition in january was financed by borrowings under the company s former credit facility and a million seller s note issued by hughes the hughes note 
the hughes note was fully paid in november acquisitions completed in and were financed by borrowings under the company s former credit facility 
the company believes it has adequate availability of capital from operations and the revolving credit facility to fund present operations and anticipated growth  including expansion in its existing and targeted market areas 
the company continually evaluates potential acquisitions and has held discussions with a number of acquisition candidates 
however  the company currently has no binding agreement with respect to any acquisition candidates 
should suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  the company believes that its financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  the company may issue common or preferred stock  which may be issued to third parties or to sellers of acquired businesses 
share repurchase program since october  the company has purchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
an additional million remains authorized for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk as a result of the variable interest rates on the company s long term debt  the company s earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  in the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with variable notional amounts 
the swaps expire december  if i the variable rates on the company s revolving credit facility were to increase from the rate at december   and ii the company borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving credit facility million for all of  solely as a result of the increase in interest rates on the outstanding debt in excess of the stated notional amounts of the swaps  the company s pretax income would decrease by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  the fair value of the company s revolving credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates
