for all transactions accounted for using the pooling of interests method  our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated as if the transactions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
our acquisitions are summarized in the following table method of transaction date accounting alltel healthcare information services  inc  or alltel purchase sdk medical computer services corporation  or sdk purchase emtek healthcare systems  or emtek a division of motorola  inc  or motorola purchase healthvision  inc  acquired by transition or healthvision purchase transition systems  inc  or transition pooling powercenter systems  inc  or pcs pooling intelus corporation  or intelus and meddata systems  inc  or med data  wholly owned subsidiaries of sun gard data systems  inc purchase msi solutions  inc and msi integrated services  inc  or collectively msi pooling during july  we invested in healthvision  inc  or healthvision  a dallas based  privately held internet healthcare company  in conjunction with vha  inc and investment entities affiliated with general atlantic partners  llc 
healthvision provides internet solutions to hospital organizations to assist them in improving patient care in the local communities they serve 
we purchased  shares of common stock for  which at the time represented of the outstanding common stock on an if converted basis 
as of december   our shares represented approximately of the common stock of healthvision on an if converted basis 
we account for our investment in healthvision using the equity method of accounting 
in connection with our relationship with healthvision  we have entered into a joint marketing arrangement under which both organizations agreed to jointly market products and services to their customers 
under this agreement  we paid healthvision million during for the sale of products and services 
during  we earned revenues from healthvision of million for hosting and other related services and had accounts receivable due from healthvision of million at december  our chairman and ceo serves as co chairman of healthvision 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of these accounting policies as discussed below require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
for contracts under which we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of labor hours incurred in relation to the total labor hours estimated under the agreement 
the percentage of completion method is used when management determines that services are essential to the functionality of the software sold 
determining factors for percentage of completion include the nature of services required and the provision for payments of software and services upon the achievement of implementation milestones 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based upon estimates of the total labor hours to be incurred and revenues to be generated throughout the term of the contract 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and could have a material effect on the our operating results in the period of change 
in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
if circumstances related to specific customers change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
at each balance sheet date  we perform a detailed assessment of our capitalized software development costs to be marketed which includes a review of  among other factors  projected revenues  customer demand requirements  product lifecycle  changes in software and hardware technologies and product development plans 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect the net realizable value of our capitalized software development costs 
the estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software  the remaining economic life of the software  or both  could change  materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs as well as our consolidated operating results in the period of change 
revenues revenues are derived from the sale of systems and services  which include the licensing of software  software and hardware maintenance  implementation and training  remote hosting  outsourcing  networking services and consulting  and from the sale of computer hardware 
our products and services are generally sold to customers pursuant to contracts that range in duration from three to ten years 
we generally contract under multiple element arrangements which include software license fees  hardware and services including consulting  implementation and software maintenance 
under these arrangements  where vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by the aicpa statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect of certain transactions 
for arrangements in which vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for each element  including specified upgrades  revenue is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all of the elements without vendor specific objective evidence has occurred 
for software license arrangements that are bundled with services and maintenance where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software and provide for payments upon the achievement of implementation milestones  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method 
under these arrangements  software license fees and implementation fees are recognized over the implementation period  which has typically ranged from to months 
revenues from other software licenses  which are bundled with long term maintenance agreements  are recognized on a straight line basis over the contracted maintenance period 
remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long term agreements that are generally of five to ten years in duration 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized monthly as the work is performed 
revenues related to other support services  such as training  consulting  and other implementation services  are recognized when the services are performed 
we recognize revenues from the sale of hardware upon delivery of the equipment to the customer 
in  in response to our customers desire for flexible pricing and more comprehensive bundled information technology solutions  we began to offer our customers the option of purchasing our solutions under arrangements that bundled the software license fees  including the right to future products within the applicable suite  with the implementation  maintenance  outsourcing  remote hosting  networking services and other related services in one comprehensive contract that provides for monthly or annual payments over the term of the contract 
we generally recognize revenues under these arrangements on a monthly basis over the term of the contract  which typically ranges from seven to ten years 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs of systems and services revenues are the amortization of acquired technology  capitalized software development costs and a network services intangible asset 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset  and capitalized software development costs are amortized generally over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related product or based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable product 
the network services intangible asset  which was amortized on a straight line basis over three years  became fully depreciated in march cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes only our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs  public relations  trade shows  advertising and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead associated with our design  development and testing of new products 
we capitalize internal software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of cost of systems and services revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which generally range from three to seven years 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consist of the value of ongoing customer relationships and goodwill  are amortized based upon the estimated economic life of the asset at the time of the acquisition  and will therefore vary among acquisitions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 our amortization of goodwill ceased as of january   leaving a recorded balance of  of goodwill as of december  we will conduct an impairment review of our remaining goodwill balance on an annual basis 
restructuring charge during  we initiated and completed a restructuring of our operations  which resulted in a charge totaling million related to the closing of duplicate facilities and the termination of employees 
during  we initiated and completed another restructuring of our operations 
this restructuring rationalized employee headcount after we completed the integration of our acquisitions 
additionally  we consolidated our research and development and implementation functions 
charges in connection with this restructuring in totaled million 
taxes as of december   we had operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
the carryforwards expire in varying amounts through and are subject to certain restrictions 
based on evidence then available  we did not record a benefit for the resulting net deferred tax asset at december   and  because we believe it is more likely then not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
results of operations compared to total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase in systems and services revenues in was primarily attributable to revenues generated under our comprehensive solutions offerings  which we began to offer during the second quarter of  and other new contracted business 
the comprehensive offerings may bundle software license fees including the right to future products within the applicable suite  implementation  maintenance  outsourcing  remote hosting  networking services and other related services into comprehensive contracts that generally provide for monthly or annual payments over the term of the contracts 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract  which typically ranges from seven to ten years 
the increase in revenues was also contributed to by improvements we made in our product delivery area  which includes research and development  implementation and customer support 
these functions were consolidated under one management team in to help improve all aspects of the product delivery cycle 
significant investments were made in this area to standardize the development  implementation and ongoing support of our products 
these investments among other things have helped shorten the product development and implementation cycles while improving quality in each area 
additionally  we continue to gain market acceptance of our products 
our flagship product  sunrise clinical manager  which was generally released in  continues to gain market acceptance and has received strong ratings by independent market research firms 
we also have seen increased activity in the revenue management area as hospitals have begun to replace legacy systems 
finally  outside organizations  including the institute of medicine  the leapfrog group and various state and local governments have begun to influence the industry with respect to patient safety initiatives 
based on the above contributing factors we experienced increased demand for our products and services in hardware revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase in hardware revenues in was primarily due to increased shipments under contracts entered into in and total cost of revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for cost of systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million  or of systems and services revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of systems and services revenues  for these costs decreased primarily as a result of the realization of integration synergies and the restructurings discussed above  which resulted in lower salaries and payroll related expenses  including medical insurance and travel 
additionally  as mentioned above  we reorganized the implementation organization to improve operating processes and procedures 
in connection with the improvements related to the reorganization  we reduced the usage of outside consultants resulting in lower expenses 
another factor contributing to the decrease was lower amortization of acquisition related acquired technology and network services assets which amounted to million and million for and  respectively 
these cost savings were partially offset by higher amortization of capitalized software development costs that amounted to million and million for and additionally  in we recorded an million charge related to the write down of certain receivables assumed in acquisitions from previous years 
cost of hardware revenues increased million  or  to million  or of hardware revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of hardware revenues  for the increase in cost of hardware revenues for was directly attributable to higher hardware revenues and lower margins due to pricing pressure in the hardware sector 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million  for however  as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses declined slightly from to 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for was primarily due to an increase in commissions resulting from an increase in new contracted business as well as costs associated with newly implemented sales incentive programs 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a program to significantly increase the size of our sales and marketing organization 
this program is expected to be completed by the end of and will result in higher expenses 
the program was implemented to increase the sales presence of our sales organization and enhance the market awareness of our company and its products and services 
research and development expenses were relatively flat at million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of total revenues  for the decrease in research and development expenses for  was due primarily to the realization of integration synergies and the restructuring 
the percentage of research and development expenditures capitalized for was  compared to for as a result of certain products becoming available for general release  amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services revenues  increased by million to million for  compared to million for research and development expenses that were capitalized were million and million for and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a program to accelerate the development of our products with respect to our sunrisexa tm initiative  which among other things  will migrate our products onto the microsoft 
net platform 
this initiative is expected to be substantially completed within the next months and to result in higher expenses over this period 
general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent for the two years at million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of total revenues  for depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the increase was primarily the result of depreciation of fixed assets purchased during partially offset by lower amortization of goodwill related to the healthvision acquisition  which became fully amortized in for and  respectively  we recorded acquisition related amortization of million and million 
pooling and transaction costs decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for during  we completed the integration of one of our acquisitions for approximately million less than previously estimated 
the transaction costs during were primarily the result of costs associated with the abandoned transactions with shared medical systems corp  or sms  and neoforma 
com  inc  or neoforma 
charges in connection with our restructuring totaled million 
other income recorded during the year ended december  related to a realized gain on the sale of our investment in sms of million  which was offset in part by a loss on sale of our investment in equity securities 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for this increase was due to significantly higher balances of cash and cash equivalents throughout  while interest rates declined 
cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to the public offering in january  as well as cash generated from operations 
as a result of these factors  we had net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to total revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for this decrease in total revenues was primarily attributable to the shift toward providing comprehensive bundled solutions  the completion of the implementations under arrangements which were recognized under the percentage of completion method and less favorable contracts we inherited as a result of recent acquisitions 
in addition  our proposed transactions with sms and neoforma  which we have since abandoned  resulted in a significant diversion of management s time and attention  which also adversely affected revenues during early hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to decreased volume of hardware sales as a result of less hardware intensive transactions 
total cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for increased costs of system and services revenues were partially offset by a decrease in costs of hardware revenues 
costs of systems and services revenues increased as a result of higher royalty related expenses associated with revenue recognized during the period  an increased level of outsourcing revenue and associated expenses  and a charge of million to write down certain receivables related to contracts assumed in acquisitions 
furthermore  we recorded a charge of million for other costs related to finalizing our acquisition integrations 
these amounts were partially offset by decreased amortization of acquired technology in connection with acquisitions completed in prior years and by cost savings associated with the consolidation of our research and development and implementation functions 
we also recorded acquisition related amortization of acquired technology and a network services asset of million and million for and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the increase was primarily due to an increase in commissions as the result of an increase in new contracts in research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the decrease was due primarily to a write off of million of capitalized software development costs related to duplicate products with no alternative future use due to the acquisition of msi in and the realization of integration synergies 
research and development expenses that were capitalized were million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million  for as a percentage of total revenues  expenses general and administrative increased from to 
the decrease was primarily due to our restructuring plans that were completed in late and this was partially offset by a million write down of receivables during depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million  for as a percentage of total revenues  expenses depreciation and amortization increased from to 
the decrease was primarily the result of certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated  partially offset by depreciation related to purchases of fixed assets during the for and  respectively  we recorded acquisition related amortization of million and million 
our restructuring resulted in a charge totaling million related to the closing of duplicate facilities and the termination of employees 
pooling and transaction costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for pooling and transaction costs incurred during were related to the poolings of powercenter and msi 
the transaction costs during were primarily the result of costs associated with the abandoned transactions with sms and neoforma 
as a result of these factors  net loss increased to million for the year ended december   from million for public offering during january  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources during  operations provided million of cash 
investing activities used million of cash  primarily for the purchase of fixed assets and the funding of development costs 
financing activities provided million of cash  as a result of the public offering discussed above  exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity is our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents 
in light of our increased balance in cash and cash equivalents  in august we terminated our revolving credit facility with a commercial bank  which had provided for maximum borrowings of up to million 
our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of growth of our sales and the timing and level of research and development activities 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash generated from our future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas  which replaces sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  addresses issues not previously addressed in sfas sfas is effective for transfers and servicing occurring after march  and  for some provisions  fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas has had no impact on the our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards require that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but should be tested for impairment at least annually  and they provide guidelines for new disclosure requirements 
these standards outline the criteria for initial recognition and measurement of intangibles  assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units and goodwill impairment testing 
additionally  under the provisions of these standards  the unamortized balance of negative goodwill will be written off and recognized as a change in accounting principle 
the provisions of sfas and apply to all business combinations after june  the provisions of sfas for existing goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be implemented effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas  amortization of goodwill ceased as of january   leaving a recorded balance of  of goodwill as of december  in october of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
impairment on goodwill is not included in the scope of sfas no 
and will be treated in accordance with the accounting standards established in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to sfas no 
 long lived assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing or discontinued operations 
the statement applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of segments of a business 
we adopted this statement on january   and do not expect the statement to have a material effect on us because a significant portion of identified intangible assets will be fully amortized by december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally buy investments with maturities of days or less 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
