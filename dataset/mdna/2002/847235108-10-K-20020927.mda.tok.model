item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant events affecting the company s earnings and financial condition during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s operations are in one line of business  electronic contract manufacturing services ems 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosures of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
the following discussion about the company s results of operations and financial condition contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  growth forecasts and results of the company s business include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  customer demand for products  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation 
an additional risk factor is the availability and cost of materials 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components in the past  which have resulted in higher prices and late deliveries 
finally  the timing of sonobuoy sales is dependent upon access to  and successful passage of  product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and frequent than in the past 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales for the year ended june   totaled  a decrease of  from fiscal overall  sales were below the company s original plan  but in line with revised expectations given the economic environment and events of september  government ems sales increased to  while commercial ems sales declined 
the increase in government sales was due to accelerated sonobuoy production  and higher than expected foreign sonobuoy sales 
the decline in commercial ems sales reflects the continued market uncertainties  particularly aerospace and the general economic recession 
the uncertainty of demand in the commercial markets led to additional measures to monitor and control costs and expenses 
operating profits of  and  were reported for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
gross margins for the year improved approximately 
the higher gross margin for the current year was reflective of a more favorable mix of government sales and continuing cost containment measures 
however  given the reduced level of sales the company continues to experience underutilized capacity 
margins on government programs are improving as the company concludes production of sonobuoy contracts that were loss contracts 
these contracts carried no gross margin and their revenues totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal at june   the remaining backlog of these loss contracts approximated million 
selling and administrative expenses were significantly below last year as the company continues to focus on cost control 
included were charges against income related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally litigation  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these epa charges are more fully discussed in note to the financial statements 
interest and investment income increased  to  in investment securities are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
other income net was  in and  in equity loss in investment was  and  in and  respectively 
at june   sparton changed its method of accounting for its investment in cybernet systems corporation cybernet 
the investment in cybernet  which represents a interest  was acquired in june cybernet is a privately held company  headquartered in ann arbor  michigan 
the company believes that the equity method is more appropriate given its increasing involvement in the company 
the use of the cost method in the past was appropri ate  but reflective of the more passive involvement at that time 
the financial statements were retroactively adjusted as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
without this change in accounting  net income for fiscal year would have been million per share 
this adjustment resulted in a decrease in previously reported net income of  per share for the year ended june  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the favorable tax rate was principally due to the tax benefit attributable to foreign sales 
after provision for applicable income taxes as discussed in note to www 
sparton 
com the financial statements  the company reported net income of  per share in fiscal  compared to  per share in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales for the year ended june   were  an increase of  from fiscal overall  commercial ems sales increased  while governmental ems sales decreased 
governmental ems sales in fiscal were below forecast due to qualification and production delays on several major sonobuoy programs 
all new production sonobuoy design programs are now qualified and production ready 
governmental sales in fiscal included shipments on several government contracts which the company expected to ship in fiscal these shipments increased reported sales by  but carried no gross margin 
customer orders and shipping schedules remained fairly consistent in fiscal despite the slowing of the economy 
new program start up and cost management continued to be areas of focus 
these efforts resulted in the identification and recovery of million from one customer in fiscal these efforts also contributed to the recovery of million of material price variances incurred during fiscal many electronic components were in short supply and allocated 
this drove up the prices of these items 
these market conditions eased somewhat by june   and the availability and price of these components were at more traditional levels 
selling and administrative expense decreased by  to  in fiscal this decrease was largely due to the inclusion of a  charge for epa remediation in the second quarter of fiscal spending for information technology increased in fiscal from fiscal  as the company continued to upgrade its facilities and equipment 
operating income of  was reported for fiscal  compared to loss of  last year 
included within these operating results were adverse manufacturing variances of  and  for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
the increased variances in fiscal were due to  higher material acquisition overhead costs as the company transitions processes  increased lease costs for new smt equipment  and lower than expected production schedules  generally in the first half of the fiscal year 
these results also reflect coors road related epa costs and expenses of  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
these epa charges are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
during the year the company experienced a number of material pricing and availability issues 
interest and investment income decreased  to  in fiscal this decrease was due to a loss on sale of equities during the year of  as well as lower average investments 
the investment securities are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
other income net was  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
included within fiscal other income net was a gain of  from the sale of equipment and other assets at the canadian operating unit 
equity loss in investment was  and  in and  respectively  for the investment in cybernet 
the financial statements were retroactively adjusted as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this resulted in a decrease in previously reported net income of  per share and  per share for the years ended june  and  respectively 
after provision for applicable income taxes as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company reported net income of  per share in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been from operations 
short term credit facilities have been used in the past to provide added liquidity 
the company continues to experience a change in its liquidity sources as the volume of us defense related contract work declines as a percentage of total company revenues 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the perfor mance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work declines  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
at the present time  the company plans on using its investment securities to provide working capital and to strategically invest in additional property  plant and equipment to accommodate growth in the ems business 
the company has had no short term debt since december  and currently has unused informal lines of credit totalling million with three banks

cash flows provided by operating activities were  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in fiscal cash flows used by operating activities were  in fiscal the primary cash flow use was a reduction in accounts payable 
primary sources included income from operations and reductions in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash flows used by investing activities were  in fiscal the major use of cash by investing activities was the purchase of investment securities 
cash flows provided by investing activities were  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively  primarily from the sale of investment securities 
cash flows used by financing activities were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
these funds were used to purchase shares of common stock for the treasury 
no financing activities occurred in fiscal at june   the company had  in working capital and a total shareowners equity of  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
in december  the company increased its accrual for the estimated cost of addressing the environmental impacts associated with its coors road plant by  pre tax 
this increase was reflective of revised cost estimates in conjunction with the negotiated consent decree that settled related lawsuits then outstanding  as well as a related administrative enforcement action  and covered activities expected to be incurred over the next thirty years 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment and operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred 
sparton reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition  and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
the company formally reviews  on a quarterly basis  costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts 
these revised estimated contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs  including but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change significantly as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
significant changes in estimate can also occur when new designs are initially www 
sparton 
com placed into production 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances contracts with commercial customers are based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently change  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers  or in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
the establishment of inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories requires a significant degree of judgment and is influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
other litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has an accrual of  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite pump and treat containment systems  a soil vapor extraction program and continued onsite and offsite monitoring 
this estimate is based on existing methodology 
legal and related consulting costs are expensed as incurred 
subsequent to june   sparton reached an agreement with the united states department of energy doe and others to recover certain remediation costs 
terms of the settlement are more fully described in item of this form k 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states and canada 
sales of the company s products are made in the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors nyse spa 
sparton logo 
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency 
the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  the interest rate risk is not considered to be material
