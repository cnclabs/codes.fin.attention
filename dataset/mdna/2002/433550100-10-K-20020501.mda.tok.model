general hirsch international corp 
hirsch or the company is a leading single source supplier of electronic computer controlled embroidery machinery and related value added products and services to the embroidery industry 
the company offers a complete line of technologically advanced single and multi head embroidery machines  proprietary application software and a diverse line of embroidery supplies and accessories 
hirsch believes its comprehensive customer service  user training  software support and broad product offerings combine to place the company in a superior competitive position within its marketplace 
the company sells embroidery machines manufactured by tajima industries ltd 
tajima and tajima usa  inc tui  a subsidiary formed in fiscal  as well as a wide variety of embroidery supplies  microcomputers manufactured by dell computer corporation and software manufactured by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pulse microsystems ltd 
pulse 
the company s focus from through was on growth and expansion of its installed machine base and increasing the breadth of its offerings to the embroidery industry 
the acquisitions of smx and sedeco increased the area in which the company is the exclusive distributor of tajima embroidery equipment from states to states 
in january  tajima granted the company the exclusive right to distribute small one through six head models tajima embroidery machines in nine western states and hawaii 
with this expansion of the company s small machine territory to the west coast  hirsch gained the right to distribute tajima machines throughout the continental united states and hawaii 
in fiscal hirsch formed tui for the purpose of assembling tajima embroidery machines in the united states 
production at tui consists of models in configurations of up to eight heads per machine 
in january tokai industries tajima s manufacturing arm purchased a percent interest in tui 
this investment reflects their continuing confidence in this endeavor and will be a contributing factor in the long range growth of tui 
in july tajima granted to hirsch the non exclusive right to distribute to its existing us customers who have expanded their operations into the caribbean region 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering through fiscal growth was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the continued strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the continued strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of multi head embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
fiscal continued the trend begun in the industry in fiscal  with retrenchment driven by the relocation and continued investment offshore of large multi head equipment customers 
while growth of small machine customers stabilized in the domestic market  the market continued to experience a decline in large machine sales  continuing the change in the sales mix of embroidery machines and an overall decline in demand 
it was further compounded by weakening value in foreign exchange of the yen versus the us dollar  resulting in dollar price pressure for machine sales 
all japanese equipment based competitors in the industry faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
in fiscal the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and consolidating facilities that we no longer required 
to support its new business model see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the continued implementation of the cost reduction program coupled with its reorganization of operational functions will allow it to position itself to return to profitable operations 
results of operations the following table presents certain income statement items expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended january   and 
net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest expense  net other expense income  net loss income before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit provision loss on discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of accounting change minority interest net loss income critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation involved in each 
revenue recognition the company distributes embroidery equipment that it offers for sale or lease 
prior to the issuance by the sec of the staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue related to the sale of equipment was recorded at the time of shipment 
the company has adopted the recommendation of sab effective with reporting for fiscal year where installation and customer acceptance are a substantive part of the sale  by its terms  the company has deferred recognition of the revenue until such customer acceptance of installation has occurred 
comparisons of financial performance have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this change in accounting method see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal year and  most sales of new equipment did not require installation within the terms of the sales contract 
service revenues and costs are recognized when services are provided 
sales of computer hardware and software are recognized when shipped provided that no significant vendor and post contract and support obligations remain and collection is probable 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company reviews its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles goodwill and purchased technologies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal   of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of smx corporation  sedeco corporation and all pro punching  inc was written off in accordance with sfas during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the remaining balance of  of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of smx corporation and sedeco corporation was written off 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations treated as purchases

 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when the company cannot determine the future utilization of some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  or compared to million for fiscal year the company believes that the reduction in the sales level for the fiscal year ended january  is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall demand for new multi head embroidery machines  as well as increased pricing pressure from the marketplace 
sales of the company s used machines  computer hardware and software  parts and service  application software and embroidery supplies for fiscal year aggregated approximately million as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
cost of sales 
for fiscal year  cost of sales decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal year the decrease was a result of the related decrease in net sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the company s gross margin declined for fiscal year to  as compared to for fiscal year included in cost of sales was a writedown of inventory of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the fluctuation of the dollar against the yen has historically had a minimal effect on tajima equipment gross margins  since currency fluctuations are generally reflected in pricing adjustments in order to maintain consistent gross margins on machine revenues  increased cost of sales reflects the continuing product mix shift from larger equipment with higher gross margins to smaller equipment with lower gross margins 
the lower gross margins also reflect the aggressive pricing used to meet market demand 
operating expenses 
as reported for fiscal year  operating expenses decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal year excluding the non recurring charges for goodwill impairment and restructuring costs  operating expenses were million  a decline of million or from million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in view of the overall industry decline in demand for embroidery equipment and related products  the resulting decline in company revenue delivered in the territories associated with the acquisition of smx corporation and sedeco corporation and the company s impairment evaluation  the company wrote off approximately million of goodwill as an impairment charge to operations 
this write off includes the remaining value of goodwill associated with its acquisition of the digitizing embroidery business assets of all pro punching  inc of approximately million  reflecting discontinuance of those operations 
the goodwill write off represented a per share net loss of both on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal year the company performed another impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter of for the smx corporation and sedeco corporation territories and as a result wrote off the balance of the goodwill associated with these acquisitions 
the goodwill write off represented a per share net loss of both on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal year operating expenses also include restructuring charges reflecting the company s plan to reduce operating costs relative to the anticipated sales volume 
included in this non recurring charge are 
million in employee severance costs and million in facilities combinations lease restructures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also continued to incur development costs associated with the hometown threads business initiative  which were partially offset  by the sale of its first franchises 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal year was million versus interest expense of million for fiscal year the company continued its aggressive inventory reduction program in fiscal year the results of this program directly reflect increased liquidity and decreased interest expense as a result of reduced working capital borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit agreements during fiscal as compared to fiscal the sale of the corporate headquarters also reduced the need for working capital borrowings 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax provision reflected an effective tax benefit rate of approximately for the twelve months ended january  as compared to an income tax benefit rate of for fiscal year the benefit rate for the fiscal year is a direct result of the job creation and worker assistance act temporarily extending the carryback of net operating losses from two years to five years 
this change has enabled the company to carryback its two most recent years losses and obtain a refund of approximately million 
the difference of the above rate to the federal statutory rate for is the valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets since the company cannot determine the future utilization of those assets 
loss on discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its hapl leasing subsidiary was not strategic to the company s ongoing objectives and discontinued operations 
the company has made provisions for the cost of winding down the operations as well as the potential losses that could be incurred in disposing of its minimum lease payments and residual receivables 
the operating loss in fiscal includes million provision for the unl liability and the sale of the residual receivable associated with it  million increase in the mlpr provision  as well as million in other costs 
the prior year s statement of operations have been restated to reflect the results of the hapl leasing subsidiary as a loss on discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss 
the net loss for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year this increase is attributable to the decrease in net sales  an increase in the cost of sales  an increase operating expenses associated with the restructuring charge of million and a loss on discontinued operations of million 
these charges were offset by the reduction in goodwill impairment charge of million  a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and an increase in tax benefit of million 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million for fiscal year the company believes that the reduction in the sales level for the fiscal year ended january  is attributable to a decrease in overall demand for new multi head embroidery machines  stability in demand for small embroidery machines  coupled with increased competition and a weakened yen exchange rate  resulting in downward pressure in us dollar pricing 
sales of new embroidery machinery represented approximately and of net sales for fiscal year s and  respectively 
small embroidery machines one through six head fx models represented approximately of total new embroidery machine sales for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year large embroidery machines six head dc models through thirty head models represented approximately of total new embroidery machine sales during fiscal year as compared to approximately for fiscal year revenue from the sale of the company s used machines  computer hardware and software  parts and service  application software and embroidery supplies for fiscal year aggregated approximately million as compared to million for fiscal year cost of sales 
for fiscal year  cost of sales decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal year the decrease was a result of the related decrease in net sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the fluctuation of the dollar against the yen has historically had a minimal effect on tajima equipment gross margins since currency fluctuations are generally reflected in pricing adjustments in order to maintain consistent gross margins on machine revenues 
the company s gross margin increased for fiscal year to  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in gross margin is mainly attributable to changes in overall sales mix 
operating expenses 
as reported for fiscal year  operating expenses increased million or  to million from million for fiscal year operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal year  from for fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal in view of the overall industry decline in demand for embroidery equipment and related products  the resulting decline in company revenue delivered in the territories associated with the acquisition of smx corporation and sedeco corporation and the company s impairment evaluation  the company wrote off approximately million of goodwill as an impairment charge to operations 
this write off includes the remaining value of goodwill associated with its acquisition of the digitizing embroidery business assets of all pro punching  inc of approximately million  reflecting discontinuance of those operations 
the goodwill write off represented a per share net loss of both on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal year the company also continued to incur development costs associated with the hometown threads business initiative 
while operating expenses continue to decline as a result of the company s cost reduction programs  of the percentage increase in operating expenses versus revenues for fiscal  a significant portion is attributable to these non recurring and developmental expenses 
based upon the decrease in net sales  the company continues to implement its cost reduction plan 
the company anticipates that actions taken in accordance with the plan will continue to reduce costs through the consolidation of support and back office infrastructure and reduction of overhead 
the company anticipates this will bring operating expenses in line with revised sales projections 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal year was million versus interest expense of million for fiscal year the company continued its aggressive inventory reduction program in fiscal year the results of this program directly reflect increased liquidity and decreased interest expense as a result of reduced working capital borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit agreements during fiscal as compared to fiscal income tax benefit provision 
the income tax provision reflected an effective tax benefit rate of approximately for the twelve months ended january  as compared to an income tax rate of for fiscal year the difference of the above rates to the federal statutory rate is the valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets since the company cannot determine the future utilization of those assets 
loss on discontinued operations 
the loss pertains to the operations of the hapl leasing subsidiary 
the prior year s statements of operations have been restated to reflect the results of the hapl leasing subsidiary as a loss on discontinued operations 
net loss 
the net loss for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year the net margin declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year these declines are attributable to the decrease in net sales  an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the reported loss for fiscal year included a cumulative effect for accounting change of million  without that change the difference between fiscal year and fiscal year would have been million greater 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities and cash flows the company s working capital was million at january   decreasing million or  from million  at january  the decrease in working capital was principally due to continued reductions in cash  inventory and accounts receivable reflecting a reduced level of business activity and funding of operating losses 
the company has financed its operations principally through long term financing of certain capital expenditures and working capital borrowings under its revolving credit facilities  and by the sale of its corporate headquarters 
during fiscal year  the company s cash decreased by million to million 
net cash of million was used by the company s operating activities and was largely driven by the net loss in fiscal  offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during fiscal the company sold its corporate headquarters in hauppauge to brandywine realty services and leased back the front half of the building 
the proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
cash generated from investing activities of  was used for the purchase of  shares of the company s stock in the open market during fiscal year  at an average cost of approximately per share 
future commitments the following table shows the company s contractual obligations related to long term obligations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations      total      revolving credit facility and borrowings effective as of september  the company entered a revolving credit and security agreement the agreement with pnc bank 
the agreement provides for a commitment of million for hirsch and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the agreement is used for working capital loans  letters of credit and deferred payment letters of credit and bears interest as defined in the agreement 
the terms of the agreement  as amended  restrict additional borrowings by the company and require the company to maintain certain interest expense coverage ratios  as defined therein 
there were no outstanding working capital borrowings against the agreement at january  the agreement was used to support trade acceptances payable of approximately million as of that date 
this agreement expires september  and the company expects to renew it at that time 
future capital requirements subsequent to the close of the year  the federal government passed the job creation and worker assistance act temporarily extending the carry back of net operating losses from two years to five years 
this should provide approximately million in cash available for operations 
the company believes these proceeds  with its existing cash and funds generated from operations  together with its existing revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to finance planned growth 
backlog and inventory the ability of the company to fill orders quickly is an important part of its customer service strategy 
the embroidery machines held in inventory by the company are generally shipped within a week from the date the customer s orders are received  and as a result  backlog is not meaningful as an indicator of future sales 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had  or will have in the foreseeable future  a material impact upon the company s operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
any company debt  if utilized  is us dollar denominated and floating rate based 
at year end  there was no usage of the revolving credit facility 
if the company had utilized its credit facility  it would have exposure to rising and falling rates  and an increase in such rates would have an adverse impact on net pre tax expenses 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
