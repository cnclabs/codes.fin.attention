in addition  the company s results of operations have historically been subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
demand for temporary staffing is historically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter  due largely to the planning cycles of many of the company s customers  and typically lower in the first fiscal quarter  due  in part  to national holidays as well as to plant shutdowns during and after the holiday season 
these and other risks and uncertainties related to the company s business are described in detail in factors affecting future operating results 
overview the company provides staffing services to  and employment opportunities at  competitive businesses in global markets 
through its network of company owned  franchise agent and licensed offices  the company offers a wide range of staffing solutions  including temporary  direct hire  replacement  supplemental and on site programs to businesses and government agencies 
the company has over years of experience in the staffing industry and operates over business services offices in states  the district of columbia and six foreign countries 
the company differentiates itself from other large temporary staffing companies by primarily focusing on recruiting and placing support personnel in secondary markets 
these support personnel often fill clerical  light industrial and light technical positions such as word processing  data entry  reception  customer service and telemarketing  warehouse labor  manufacturing and assembly 
these assignments support either core or non core functions of the customer s business 
the general level of economic activity and unemployment in the united states and the countries in which the company operates significantly affects demand for the company s staffing services 
companies generally use temporary staffing services to manage personnel costs and staffing needs 
when economic activity increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
during these periods of increased economic activity and generally higher levels of employment  the competition among temporary staffing firms for qualified temporary personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that during these periods the company will be able to recruit the temporary personnel necessary to fill its customers job orders in which case the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition may be adversely affected 
as economic activity slows  many companies reduce their utilization of temporary employees before releasing full time employees 
consequently  the company may experience less demand for its services and more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn 
therefore  a continued economic downturn could continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
recent developments on january   the company announced a change in leadership 
effective as of that date  tom d 
seip  appointed president and chief executive officer of the company on may   resigned and was replaced by dwight s 
pedersen 
mr 
pedersen had been serving as a member of the company s board of directors since may concurrent with the change in management  the company implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve the company s profitability 
this restructuring plan will result in a fiscal first quarter pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the restructuring charge includes costs associated with the abandonment of certain management information systems which were under development as well as severance  lease termination and other costs related to the company s announced layoffs and office closures 
at november  the company had million outstanding principal under its year senior secured notes  payable in equal annual installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the company was out of compliance with certain covenants of these senior notes as well as with certain covenants of its revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal the company is currently negotiating with the bank syndicate holding the revolving credit facility to amend and restate the credit facility agreement  thereby waiving default attributable to the covenant violations that existed at november  although the company had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at that date  it relies on the facility for purposes of meeting letter of credit requirements in connection with its workers compensation program and for working capital  if required 
as of the date of this filing on form k  the company had million in outstanding letters of credit  needs to arrange for an increase of million in the letters of credit by march  and had no borrowings available to it under the existing facility 
the senior noteholders have indicated they are awaiting the outcome of the credit facility negotiations and if those are completed in a satisfactory manner  they are willing to realign the covenants of the senior notes on a prospective basis and waive the covenant violations that existed at november  in addition to its outstanding senior notes and revolving credit facility  the company has an outstanding financial guarantee bond in the amount of million that secures a portion of its workers compensation premium and deductible obligations 
this bond is renewable annually on november and days advance written notice of non renewal is required 
the bondholder has expressed its intent to exit the surety bond market and  consequently  not renew the bond 
whereas no formal notice of non renewal has been received  the bondholder has expressed its desire to cancel this bond prior to november   if feasible 
discussions are underway for the purpose of reducing the bond to million by april   which will require the company to either increase its outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility or cash collateralize the net decrease of million 
should non renewal of the bond occur as of november   the company projects is will be required to either restructure its workers compensation program to reduce its letter of credit requirements  obtain additional letters of credit or financial guarantee bonds to replace the expiring financial guarantee bond  or seek alternative financing 
the company s financing challenges present risks to investors during calendar year see item business factors affecting future operating results and liquidity and capital resources within this item for further information on these recent developments 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company sold certain of its franchise agent and company owned medical offices and entered into a termination agreement with one of its medical licensees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed the sale of the remaining medical business to intrepid usa inc intrepid under an asset purchase agreement 
under the terms of the sale  the company retained the trade and medicare accounts receivable balances as well as the due from licensee balances 
in fiscal  the company recorded after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share 
these losses primarily represented reserves for trade and medicare accounts receivable and due from licensee balances  and also included additional operating losses resulting from the extended period required to close the sale and a reduction in the estimated proceeds from the sale 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share 
this charge was primarily due to lower than expected settlements of medicare cost reports 
the company has appealed a number of cost report settlements and hopes to recover additional funds in the future  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its appeals 
from fiscal through fiscal  the company had received million in cash proceeds from the sale of its medical operations with an additional million due from intrepid as the balance of the purchase price under a guaranteed promissory note which was in default 
in august  intrepid filed a demand for arbitration seeking compensatory and punitive damages alleging  among other things  that the company made misrepresentations and otherwise breached the asset purchase agreement 
in fiscal  the arbitrator awarded intrepid million  mainly for breaches of certain representations  warranties and covenants in the asset purchase agreement  plus arbitration expenses and legal and accounting fees of approximately million 
the company was awarded the million due on the promissory note  plus interest 
in addition  the arbitrator did not find fraud and denied intrepid s claim for punitive damages 
the company has paid the amounts awarded to the claimant in full  except for certain indemnity claims that may be subject to future determination  which the company currently believes will not be significant 
primarily due to the unfavorable arbitration award  the company recorded an after tax loss from discontinued operations of million or per share  in the second quarter of fiscal the after tax loss included additional reserves for potential liabilities  medicare and other contingencies  as well as reserves for medical operations net operating loss carryforwards which the company believes will expire unused over the next three years 
recorded estimated losses on the disposal of the medical operations are based on a number of assumptions 
these include the estimated costs and write offs required to collect the remaining medicare accounts receivable and due from licensee balances  and estimated costs to be incurred in filing and settling all remaining medicare cost reports and other estimated legal and incidental costs 
currently  the company believes it has adequately reserved for the reasonable outcome of future events  as evidenced by the net liability position existing at november  however  should actual costs differ materially from those estimated by management  the company would record additional losses or gains in future periods 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of sales of services and license fees 
fiscal year sales of services license fees total sales of services and license fees costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of intangible assets arbitration award operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
sales of services decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal while average bill rates increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  billed hours declined 
fiscal included fifty three weeks while fiscal included fifty two weeks 
after eliminating the effect of the extra week in fiscal  billed hours declined 
sales of services decreased for domestic business services and for international business services 
the decline in domestic business services primarily reflects the economic slowdown during the year and the resulting current recession  which has decreased demand for staffing services across the majority of the company s geographic regions 
in the latter portion of fiscal  the economic environment placed strong competitive pressures on pricing which negatively affected sales of services 
contingent on the duration of the us economic recession  its recovery period and the extent of economic recovery attained  the company currently estimates that year over year decrease in sales will continue through at least the first half of fiscal  and possibly beyond 
global economic conditions and declines in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the international results 
excluding the effect of rate fluctuations  fiscal international sales of services decreased as compared to fiscal license fees are charged to licensed offices based either on a percentage of sales or a percentage of gross profit generated by the license offices 
license fees decreased million or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in licensees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees  two licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program  and two licensees essentially closed operations 
in the second quarter of fiscal  two licensees purchased the company s interest in their licensed operations 
a million pre tax gain from the sale of these operations is included in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
license fee income from these operations ceased 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal one of the remaining licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal the company purchased the operations of one of its three remaining licensees 
consequently  the company expects license fee revenue in fiscal periods to be significantly lower than comparable fiscal periods 
cost of services 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an additional charge for workers compensation costs of million 
the effective decrease in gross margin for fiscal is primarily due to lower license fees and the overall effects of the current recession 
the company strives to improve gross margin where feasible  however  with the recession and competitive pressures on prices  the opportunities available to increase gross margin are limited 
the company currently estimates that year over year decreases in gross margin will continue through at least the first half of fiscal  and possibly beyond 
workers compensation costs were of direct labor for fiscal and for fiscal these costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical staffing and light industrial staffing 
recent upward trends in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate costs for all open policy years have resulted in an increase in the company s workers compensation accruals for these costs 
the company currently estimates that the accrual rates for workers compensation costs will be in the range of to of direct labor for fiscal  as a result of increased workers compensation costs across the industry 
the company reviews interim actuarial estimates and monitors accrual rates to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of loss trends  however  there can be no assurance that the company s programs to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the franchise agents operation 
franchise agents share of gross profit decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit increased from during fiscal to for fiscal  reflecting a change in the relative mix of sales of services from company owned  franchise and international business services 
selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal as noted above in sales of services and license fees  included in fiscal selling and administrative expenses is a million gain on the sale of certain licensed operations 
additionally  fiscal includes million in pre tax charges as a result of the company s terminated recapitalization 
absent these two items selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal increase is primarily the result of declining sales outpacing the extent of reductions in selling and administrative expenditures 
during fiscal  the company implemented a number of cost containment initiatives  including the closure or consolidation of non performing offices and staff reductions  in an effort to reduce the impact of the sales decline on its profitability 
included in fiscal selling and administrative expenses are charges of approximately million  primarily relating to severance and other office closure costs 
as noted above in recent developments the company is implementing a restructuring plan which will result in a first quarter fiscal charge of approximately million  primarily for costs associated with the abandonment of certain management information systems under development and severance  lease termination and other costs as a result of layoffs and office closures 
the company continues to seek viable ways to reduce costs where possible  however  there can be no assurance that material cost savings which have been or will be  identified or implemented will be adequate to improve operating income levels in future periods 
loss on impairment of intangible assets 
management of the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  by determining whether the amortization of the asset s balance over its remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows from operations 
when such estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a potential impairment exists 
during fiscal  a number of businesses the company acquired over the past several years were negatively impacted by the economic recession 
based on management s assessment of projected undiscounted future cash flows and estimates of market value based on industry specific multiples  it was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles related to specific acquisitions had been permanently impaired in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to write down these assets to estimated current net realizable values 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective at the beginning of the company s fiscal year with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but instead will be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test upon initial adoption of the statement  and at least annually thereafter  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company is assessing the impact of adopting sfas  but has not yet determined the effect  if any  on its financial position or results of operations 
although goodwill amortization will cease at that time  it is possible that an additional impairment charge could be recorded based on the results of the fair value approach under the new standard 
arbitration award 
on march   synergy staffing  inc filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california against the company  all members of its board of directors and one of the executive officers 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that the defendants fraudulently induced the plaintiff to sell the assets of the personnel connection  inc the plaintiff sought to have the court grant a jury trial  and award the plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees and other costs 
the company s petition for an order compelling arbitration was granted  the superior court lawsuit was stayed  discovery was completed  and on december  an arbitration hearing commenced 
on january  the arbitration panel rendered an interim award in favor of the claimant for compensatory damages of million  plus interest from the date of the award  as well as reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in the proceeding  subject to an application process 
on february   an order modifying interim award was issued crediting the company million paid to the claimants in january  under a price protection clause in the asset purchase agreement  thereby reducing the award for compensatory damages to million 
as a result of the arbitration  the company recorded an accrued liability and related pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the estimated cost of the award  plus other related expenses 
this estimate is based on management s assumptions as to the ultimate outcome of future events and actual results could differ from this estimate 
however  in the opinion of management  possible additional charges or gains related to this matter are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower debt levels under the company s senior secured credit facilities 
interest income increased million or during the same period as a result of the short term investment of excess cash from operations 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  the company had an income tax provision from continuing operations of approximately million on a pre tax loss of million 
the income tax provision was primarily caused by recognition of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
these allowances were recorded against the tax assets arising from future deduction of federal  state and foreign taxable income because the company has recently reassessed the potential for their realization in future years 
whereas it is possible these deferred tax assets could still be realized in the future  the company currently evaluates it as unlikely these will be realizable 
the company has retained net deferred tax assets of million from the net operating loss for fiscal because it believes it can realize these by carrying them back to taxes paid in fiscal additionally  the company retains a deferred tax asset of million for fiscal taxable income  because it currently believes it will realize this as a result of future results of operations 
absent the valuation allowances recognized  the company had an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective tax benefit rate of 
this income tax benefit is primarily generated by the charge for the loss on intangible asset impairment and arbitration award noted above and partially reduced due to permanent differences 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
sales of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal average bill rates increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  while billed hours declined slightly 
same store sales increased by for fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of services increased for domestic business services and for international business services 
fiscal domestic sales of services were adversely affected by competitive pressures for the supply of temporary staff as a result of the low unemployment rates in the united states economy during fiscal as well as decreasing demand for temporary staffing services in some sectors of the economy as indications of an economic slowdown became apparent 
declines in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the international results as reported 
excluding the effect of these rate fluctuations  fiscal international sales of services increased as compared to fiscal acquisitions did not have a significant effect on the increase in fiscal sales of services 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees 
fiscal acquisitions were limited to buy backs and conversion of six of the company s franchise agents operations to company owned offices 
license fees decreased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees  two licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program  and two licensees essentially closed operations 
cost of services 
costs of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to higher workers compensation costs and lower license fees 
additionally  the company expanded its on location program accounts which generally carry lower margins than traditional service accounts  and experienced increased downward pressures on margins due to competition 
workers compensation costs were of payroll for fiscal and for fiscal as a result of increases in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate losses for all open policy years  the company recorded an additional charge for workers compensation costs of million  or per share  net of taxes  during the fourth quarter of fiscal franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit increased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit increased from during fiscal to for fiscal selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal fiscal includes million in pre tax charges as a result of the company s terminated recapitalization 
fiscal also reflects increased costs for bad debts  increased communication costs in connection with the company s wide area network  higher depreciation and outside services costs for on going management information system initiatives and increased foreign currency transaction losses due to the effect of declining exchange rates with the company s international operations 
additionally  selling and administrative expenses for fiscal were lower as a result of domestic gross receipt tax refunds and united kingdom advance corporation tax refunds 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of higher average borrowings for domestic business services 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal reflecting the decrease in pre tax income from continuing operations of million 
the effective income tax rate was for both fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations through cash generated by operating activities and through various forms of debt and equity financing and bank lines of credit 
the company s principal use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth  and for management information systems initiatives 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
as a result of seasonal fluctuations  accounts receivable balances are historically higher in the fourth fiscal quarter and are generally at their lowest during the first fiscal quarter 
accordingly  short term borrowings used to finance accounts receivable generally follow a similar seasonal pattern 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  cash generated from operations increased in spite of a net loss because a number of the expenses  including the impairment loss of million and the deferred tax valuation allowance of million were non cash charges 
increased net cash flows were primarily provided by decreases in accounts receivable balances 
as a result of the economic recession  collection of outstanding receivables outpaced the growth of receivables generated by current sales 
somewhat offsetting the increase in fiscal net cash flows generated by accounts receivable collections were reductions in the current year payroll  payroll tax and bank overdraft accruals 
additionally  prepaid income taxes were reduced as a result of approximately million in tax refunds received related to prior fiscal years 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company received additional income tax refunds of million and is anticipating further tax related refunds of approximately million during the remainder of fiscal cash used for capital expenditures  which are primarily for management information systems initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during the first fiscal quarter of  the company ceased further development on its lawson software integrated front to back office system see item business management information systems 
currently  the company anticipates that fiscal cash outflows for management information systems and other capital expenditures will be below fiscal levels 
during fiscal  no acquisition related intangible assets were acquired 
in fiscal and fiscal  cash outflows for new acquisitions and for contingent payments under existing acquisitions totaled million and million  respectively 
the company currently intends to focus on internal operations and has no plans to make significant acquisitions at this time  but may continue to acquire certain of its franchise or licensed operations and convert these to company owned 
in the future  the company may again pursue opportunities for growth through strategic external acquisitions 
in the second quarter of fiscal  two licensees purchased the company s interest in their licensed operations 
of the million pre tax gain from the sale of these operations  at november  the company had received million in cash proceeds with the balance represented by notes receivable due in installments through the first quarter of fiscal at november  the company had million outstanding principal under its year senior secured notes  payable in equal annual installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the company was out of compliance with certain covenants of these senior notes at the end of fiscal the company also maintains a five year revolving credit facility entered into on march  the maximum availability under this facility is million  and it exists to meet letter of credit requirements in connection with its workers compensation program  as well as for working capital purposes 
as of the date of this filing on form k  there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility 
however  the company had million in outstanding letters of credit covered by the facility  needs to arrange for an increase of million in the letters of credit by march  and had no borrowings available to it under the existing facility 
further  the company was out of compliance with certain covenants of the facility at the end of fiscal the company believes that its workers compensation collateral requirements will be met through cash collateral or increased letters of credit  however  the insurer may require the company to satisfy such requirements through letters of credit only 
if the company were unable to satisfy the insurer s increased letter of credit requirements  the insurer could cancel the workers compensation insurance program 
if the company loses workers compensation insurance program coverage or is forced to reduce the amount of coverage available  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition which may adversely affect the trading price of its stock 
the company is currently negotiating with the bank syndicate holding the revolving credit facility to amend and restate the credit facility agreement thereby waiving default attributable to the covenant violations that existed at november  additionally  the senior noteholders have indicated they are awaiting the outcome of the credit facility negotiations and if those are completed in a satisfactory manner  they have indicated they are willing to realign the covenants of the senior notes on a prospective basis and waive the covenant violations that existed at november  as of the date of this filing on form k  the senior noteholders have not delivered a notice of default to the company  as is their right due to the covenant violations 
however  because these covenant violations have not been cured  the company has reclassified the entire million of principal outstanding under the senior notes to a current liability on its balance sheet as at the november  as noted above  the company is currently in negotiations with its bank syndicate as well as its senior noteholders to amend and restate its existing agreements  and has received proposed terms for the amended and restated agreements 
while there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in closing the amended and restated agreements or that the proposed terms will remain as is  the company anticipates that the amended and restated agreements will result in significant up front fees as well as higher borrowing rates and letter of credit fees as compared to the current agreement 
in addition to its outstanding senior notes and revolving credit facility  the company has an outstanding financial guarantee bond in the amount of million that secures a portion of its workers compensation premium and deductible obligations 
this bond is renewable annually on november and days advance written notice of non renewal is required 
the bondholder has expressed its intent to exit the surety bond market and  consequently  not renew the bond 
whereas no formal notice of non renewal has been received  the bondholder has expressed its desire to cancel this bond prior to november   if feasible 
discussions are underway for the purpose of reducing the bond to million by april   which will require the company to either increase its outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility or cash collateralize the net decrease of million 
should non renewal of the bond occur as of november   the company projects is will be required to either restructure its workers compensation program to reduce its letter of credit requirements  obtain additional letters of credit or financial guarantee bonds to replace the expiring financial guarantee bond  or seek alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in restructuring its workers compensation program  reducing letter of credit requirements  obtaining additional letters of credit or financial guarantee bonds or obtaining alternative financing

in march  the selling parties  synergy staffing  inc filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california against the company  all members of its board of directors and one of the executive officers
