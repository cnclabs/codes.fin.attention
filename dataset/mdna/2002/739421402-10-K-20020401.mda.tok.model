item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview since our inception  we have been engaged in developing drugs for the treatment of a variety of human diseases 
our lead program is the development of plenaxis tm abarelix for injectable suspension  a drug for the treatment of diseases that respond to the lowering of hormone levels 
we are developing plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis 
we had entered into collaborations with amgen and sanofi synthelabo to develop and commercialize our plenaxis products 
in september  amgen notified us that it was terminating its agreement with us 
in october  sanofi synthelabo gave us notice that it was terminating its agreement with us 
both terminations were effective in december as a result  all of the licenses for plenaxis granted to amgen and sanofi synthelabo under these agreements  and all rights of amgen and sanofi synthelabo in the plenaxis program  have terminated 
in this connection we are finalizing agreements with amgen and sanofi synthelabo in an effort to assure a successful transition of the rights and responsibilities for the continued development and commercialization of plenaxis and to provide for  among other things  final cash payments and mutual releases 
we are also conducting clinical trials of apan  our proprietary drug candidate for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
in addition  we have a number of other product candidates in the research or preclinical development stage 
in september  we decided not to proceed with additional clinical trials of latranal  our in licensed drug candidate being developed for the relief of musculoskeletal pain  due to the lack of efficacy observed in a phase ii clinical trial 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
we have received revenues in the form of signing  performance based  cost sharing and contract services payments from corporate collaborations 
we will receive no additional revenues under the amgen and sanofi synthelabo agreements  other than a potential final reimbursement payment from sanofi synthelabo 
accordingly  for the foreseeable future  we do not expect to have any revenues other than interest income and the potential payment from sanofi synthelabo 
our accumulated deficit as of december  was approximately million 
at december   we had full time employees  of whom were engaged in research and development activities  compared to full time employees at december   of whom were engaged in research and development activities 
substantially all of our expenditures to date have been for drug development and commercialization activities and for general and administrative expenses 
due to the high costs associated with continued development  and preparing for the possible commercial launch  of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer  as well as other research and development and general and administrative expenses  we had a net operating loss for we expect to have net operating losses for the next several years  due  in part  to our assumption of all plenaxis program costs as of the effective dates of the amgen and sanofi synthelabo terminations 
we do not expect to generate operating income unless  and not until several years after  we receive fda approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
we will need to receive regulatory approval to market all of our future products 
through december   we have recognized an aggregate of approximately million in non refundable fees and performance based payments  and approximately million in reimbursement for ongoing development costs  under the sanofi synthelabo agreement 
of this amount  we recognized the million initial non refundable signing fee payment through december   the effective date of termination of the sanofi synthelabo agreement  which was the period during which we were obligated under the agreement to participate on a continuing and substantial basis in the research  development and manufacturing process development of plenaxis products 
as noted above  we are finalizing an agreement with sanofi synthelabo regarding the termination of its license agreement  which we expect will be executed during the second quarter of in addition  through december   we have recognized an aggregate of approximately million of revenues under the amgen agreement 
we received a million signing fee under the amgen agreement which we recognized as revenue through december   the effective date of termination of the amgen agreement  which was the period during which we were obligated under the agreement to participate on a continuing and substantial basis in the research  development and manufacturing process development of plenaxis products 
under the amgen agreement  amgen paid the first million of all authorized costs and expenses associated with the research  development and commercialization of plenaxis products in the united states 
amgen s initial million funding commitment was fulfilled during the third quarter of following amgen s completion of this funding  we became responsible for one half of all subsequent united states research and development costs for plenaxis products 
additionally  the agreement provided that following amgen s completion of its million funding commitment  we must reimburse amgen for one half of the costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure for plenaxis products in the united states 
as noted above  we are finalizing an agreement with amgen regarding the termination of its agreement with us  which we expect will be executed during the second quarter of critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition 
we have previously entered into corporate collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements provided for the partitioning of the development  manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities related to potential drug candidates 
under these arrangements  we were obligated to participate in several aspects of the remaining development and manufacturing of our drug candidate  plenaxis 
our collaborations generally have provided for our partners to make up front payments and additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones  share in the costs of development and or pay royalties  and in some cases  profit sharing payments to us based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under this accounting method  we recognize revenue when it is earned  that is when all of the following have occurred all of our obligations relating to the revenue have been met and the earning process is complete  the monies received or receivable are not refundable irrespective of research results  and there are neither future obligations nor future milestones to be met by us with respect to such revenue 
in general  collaboration revenues are earned based upon research expenses incurred and milestones achieved 
non refundable payments upon initiation of contracts are deferred and amortized over the period in which we are obligated to participate on a continuing and substantial basis in the research and development activities outlined in each contract 
we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
amounts received in advance of reimbursable expenses are deferred and only recognized when the related expenses have been incurred 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the parties agree that the milestone has been achieved and it is deemed that no further obligations exist 
use of estimates 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reporting of our assets and our liabilities as well as the disclosures that we make regarding assets and liabilities and income and expense that are contingent upon uncertain factors as of the reporting date 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have accrued an estimate of our potential liability as of december  under our agreement with amgen which has been terminated 
the actual payments  and thus our actual results  could differ from our estimates 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in revenues was the result of decreases in both the amount and rate of reimbursement of plenaxis expenses from our former collaborators  as well as the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of we will receive no additional revenues under the amgen or sanofi synthelabo agreements  other than a possible final reimbursement payment from sanofi synthelabo 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in this decrease in expenses was due primarily to the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of combined with reduced clinical spending during the second half of as we repositioned the plenaxis program in response to issues raised by the fda in june as we initiate new clinical trials for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis  continue our apan clinical program and add new clinical programs  we expect our research and development expenses will increase during and thereafter 
members of our research and development team typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  a substantial amount of our fixed costs such as facility depreciation  utilities and maintenance are shared by our various programs 
accordingly  we have not and do not plan to separately track the costs for each of our research and development programs 
during and  we estimate that the majority of our research and development expense was related to clinical trial costs  manufacturing and materials inventory costs  salaries and lab supplies related to our prostate cancer and endometriosis clinical programs 
the remaining research and development costs were incurred in our apan clinical program  as well as our preclinical research programs 
we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of prostate cancer during in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
however  the fda raised certain concerns over the results of the data submitted to them and  therefore  we recently initiated an additional clinical trial in an effort to respond to those concerns 
in  we began our clinical program to develop plenaxis for the treatment of endometriosis 
we recently completed the follow up phase of a phase ii iii study in this program 
we expect to submit additional data to the fda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer by the end of the first quarter of with respect to our endometriosis program  we expect to meet with the fda mid year to discuss the results of our phase ii iii study and the timing and scope of additional clinical trials 
we began our clinical program for apan in we are currently conducting a phase i study of apan which we anticipate will be completed during the second half of we expect to initiate a second phase i study in the first half of in which we intend to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of apan in individuals suffering from alzheimer s disease 
we anticipate that the substantial majority of our research and development costs over the next few years will be focused on the development of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis 
in addition  as discussed above  we currently have several other ongoing research and development programs 
using industry estimates  typical drug development programs may last for ten or more years and may cost hundreds of millions of dollars to complete 
as our programs progress  we will assess the possibility of entering into corporate collaborations to offset a portion of development costs 
the ultimate success of our research and development programs and the impact of these programs on our operations and financial results cannot be accurately predicted and will depend  in large part  upon the outcome and timing of many variables outside of our control 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in expenses was primarily the result of our obligation under our agreement with amgen  beginning in the third quarter of  to pay one half of all subsequent costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure in the united states for plenaxis through the launch period 
these increases were partially offset by decreased spending on marketing and sales for the plenaxis program during the second half of in response to issues raised by the fda 
due to the termination of the amgen and sanofi synthelabo agreements  which provided for the sharing of the costs associated with commercialization  our sales and marketing expenses may increase as we incur costs related to preparing for the possible launch of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase was due to an increase in personnel related operating costs and increased use of professional services 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we hire additional administrative personnel to support continued growth of our research  development and pre commercialization initiatives and incur increased operating costs related to our new facility 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in interest income was due to increased cash and investment balances from our follow on public offering in february  offset by lower interest rates 
the increase in interest expense was due to a higher average principal balance outstanding for a full year under our loan agreement during the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was zero and million  respectively 
the provision for income taxes during was primarily for state income taxes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in a net operating loss carryforward position during and for several years thereafter 
therefore  as in  no benefit from our operating losses has been recognized 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  have been established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire in varying amounts through  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to substantial annual limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million  from approximately million in the decrease in revenues was the result of a decrease in reimbursable plenaxis expenses  offset by the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to the cost of the inventory associated with the one time sale of materials inventory to amgen during the fourth quarter of  combined with increased expenses related to our plenaxis clinical development program for hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
this increase also was partially due to increased spending related to our plenaxis clinical development program for endometriosis  our latranal and apan clinical development programs  and discovery research initiatives 
amgen s initial funding commitment was completed during the third quarter of  after which we became responsible for one half of all subsequent united states research and development costs for plenaxis products through the launch period 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in following the completion of amgen s initial funding commitment  we became responsible for one half of all subsequent costs associated with establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure in the united states for plenaxis through the launch period 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase was due to an increase in personnel and compensation costs  an increased use of professional services and other costs associated with being a public company 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  from approximately million in the increase in interest income was due to increased cash and investment balances from our initial public offering in may and an increase in interest rates from the same period in the prior year 
the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was approximately during the provision for income taxes during was primarily for state income taxes 
we were in a net operating loss carryforward position in and  therefore  no benefit from our operating losses was recognized 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth our unaudited statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended december  this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing in this report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
you should not draw any conclusions from the operating results for any quarter

 in thousands  except per share data total revenues         operating loss         net loss         basic and diluted net loss per share we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future  and  therefore  we will continue to have difficulty providing an accurate forecast of our quarterly revenues and operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as any indication of future performance 
it is likely that our operating results in one or more future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception principally through private placements of equity securities and the proceeds from our public offerings 
prior to our initial public offering  we had received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from various private placements of our securities 
in may  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  raising a total of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  raising a total of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
additionally  we have received a total of approximately million from one time signing payments and performance based payments  cost reimbursements and contract service payments under our collaboration agreements 
we have also received approximately million from interest on invested cash balances  and paid approximately million in interest associated with building and equipment financing 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  during  we expect to spend in the range of approximately  to  on operations and approximately  to  on development programs 
we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for approximately the next three years 
for the year ended december   net cash of approximately million was used in operating activities  compared to approximately million used in operating activities during during the year ended december   our use of cash in operations was due principally to our net loss  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable consisting principally of our share of accrued plenaxis program expenses pursuant to the amgen agreement 
our investing activities during the year ended december  consisted of the purchase  sale and maturity of marketable securities  as well as million of additional spending toward the build out of our new corporate headquarters and other fixed asset additions 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted principally of the million of proceeds from our follow on public offering and million of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options  as well as advances of million under an acquisition and construction loan agreement 
in july  in connection with the purchase  through our wholly owned real estate subsidiary  of our new corporate headquarters and research facility in waltham  massachusetts  the subsidiary entered into an acquisition and construction loan agreement providing for up to million in financing for the acquisition of  and improvements to  the new facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the loan agreement 
advances bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor plus at december  
interest is payable monthly in arrears 
principal is due and payable in full on july   subject to two one year extension options 
the loan is secured by the new facility  together with all fixtures  equipment  improvements and other related items  and by all rents  income or profits received by our real estate subsidiary  and is unconditionally guaranteed by us 
in addition to this financing  as of december   we had spent approximately million of our own funds in connection with the build out and occupancy of our new facility 
we occupied the new facility during may and as planned  are actively seeking to sublease a portion of this facility 
we do not believe that there is any impairment issue at this time 
we terminated the lease for our cambridge  massachusetts facility effective as of september  in addition  in connection with our move to the new facility  we consolidated our provid research division with our massachusetts operations and  effective october   have assigned to a third party all of our right  title and interest in and to the lease for the new jersey facility and the third party has assumed all of our obligations thereunder 
in addition to our long term debt  we have fixed contractual obligations under various supply agreements 
these fixed contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years in thousands long term debt   unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations   in january  we assumed all of amgen s rights and obligations under a development and supply agreement with ucb 
under the terms of this agreement  we are committed to pay ucb approximately million for the supply of clinical and commercial volumes of pharmaceutical peptide to be delivered by the end of we expect our funding requirements to increase over the next several years as we prepare for the possible commercial launch of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer  continue with current prostate cancer and endometriosis clinical trials for plenaxis and clinical trials for apan  initiate preclinical trials for additional product candidates  continue to improve our facility and expand our research and development initiatives 
the amount of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the cost  timing and outcomes of fda and other regulatory reviews  decisions relating to the plenaxis program made by us  the effect of the termination of our plenaxis corporate collaborations and our ability to assume the responsibilities under these agreements or contract with other third parties to do so  the development of sales and marketing resources by us  the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements for plenaxis or our other potential products  the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with  or acquisitions of  other companies  the progress of our research and development activities  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates under development  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to sublease a portion of our new facility  and the availability of additional financing 
at december   we had provided a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance represents the excess of the deferred tax asset over the benefit from future losses that could be carried back if  and when  they occur 
due to anticipated operating losses in the future  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future and we have provided an appropriate valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
 which became effective for fiscal year sfas no 
requires all derivatives to be carried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value would depend on the hedging relationship and would be reported in the income statement or as a component of comprehensive income 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the provisions of these statements is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations since we do not have any goodwill or intangibles at this time 
on october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the fundamental provision of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas no 
provides additional guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requiring that a long lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as an asset held for sale until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
will be effective in application of sfas no 
is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations since we do not believe that we have any impairments at this time 
risk factors that may affect future results because we have not yet marketed or sold any products and anticipate significant increases in our operating expenses over the next several years  we may not be profitable in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future or  if we are profitable  that it will be sustainable 
all of our potential products are in the research or development stage 
we have not yet marketed or sold any products  and we may not succeed in developing and marketing any product in the future 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from payments under corporate collaboration and license agreements 
due to the termination of the amgen and sanofi synthelabo agreements  for the foreseeable future  we do not expect to have any revenues  other than interest income and any final reimbursement payment from sanofi synthelabo 
in addition  we expect to continue to spend significant amounts to continue clinical studies  seek regulatory approval for our existing product candidates  develop commercial capabilities and expand our facilities 
we also intend to spend substantial amounts to fund additional research and development for other potential products  enhance our core technologies  and for general and administrative purposes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly in the near term  primarily due to the termination of the amgen and sanofi synthelabo agreements  resulting in significant operating losses for and the next several years 
if our clinical trials are not successful  or if we are otherwise unable to obtain and maintain the regulatory approval required to market and sell our potential products  we would incur additional operating losses 
the development and sale of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval typically is costly and takes many years 
regulatory authorities  most importantly  the fda  have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval in the united states  and mandate product recalls 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other actions as to our potential products or against us 
outside the united states  we can market a product only if we receive marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of risks associated with the fda approval process  and may include additional risks 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate in clinical trials  and satisfy the fda as to  the safety and efficacy of the product in clinical trials 
if we develop a product to treat a long lasting disease  such as cancer or alzheimer s disease  we must gather data over an extended period of time 
there are many risks associated with our clinical trials 
for example  we may be unable to achieve the same level of success in later trials as we did in earlier ones 
additionally  data we obtain from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could impede regulatory approval 
further  some patients in our prostate cancer and alzheimer s disease programs have a high risk of death  age related disease or other adverse medical events that may not be related to our products 
these events may affect the statistical analysis of the safety and efficacy of our products 
if we obtain regulatory approval for a product  the approval will be limited to those diseases for which our clinical trials demonstrate the product is safe and effective 
in addition  many factors could delay or result in termination of our ongoing or future clinical trials 
for example  a clinical trial may experience slow patient enrollment or lack of sufficient drug supplies 
patients may experience adverse medical events or side effects  and there may be a real or perceived lack of effectiveness of  or of safety issues associated with  the drug we are testing 
future governmental action or existing or changes in fda policies or precedents  may also result in delays or rejection of an application for marketing approval 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain product registration or marketing approval for plenaxis  our drug candidate for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis  or for any of our other product candidates  or regulatory approval may be conditioned upon significant labeling requirements which could adversely affect the marketability or value of the product 
to date  none of our product candidates has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
in june  we received a letter from the fda with respect to our nda for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive prostate cancer  which was submitted in december the fda indicated that the information presented in the nda was inadequate for approval 
in september  we met with the fda in an effort to clarify the various deficiencies cited in the fda s letter  and to discuss what further steps needed to be taken before the application could be approved 
the fda recommended that we analyze the allergic reactions that occurred in a small subset of clinical trial patients 
we are conducting this analysis utilizing existing data and samples 
in addition  the fda expressed concern that  in a subset of patients treated beyond the three month pivotal study time frame  testosterone suppression was not maintained at a comparable level to that of patients treated with either lupron depot or lupron depot plus casodex 
the fda also indicated that the nature of the testosterone surge  if any  associated with treating patients with plenaxis and then switching them to a currently available therapy should be understood 
we considered various alternatives to address these issues  and in december the fda indicated that we could proceed with our clinical plans to study the effects of using currently available hormonal therapies in prostate cancer patients following treatment with plenaxis 
the fda also indicated that our plan to further evaluate the rare allergic reactions that occurred in our clinical trials was acceptable 
we can give no assurance that our additional clinical studies will yield positive results or that the results  even if positive  will satisfy fda concerns that have been or may be raised 
we cannot assure investors that we will be successful in obtaining approval for the commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer or any other indication 
these fda actions have delayed  and otherwise adversely affected  our obtaining regulatory approval to market plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
moreover  there could be further delays due to fda review or action  and the fda could deny approval altogether 
if we are further delayed in obtaining or are unable to obtain this regulatory approval  or regulatory approval to market our other potential products  we may exhaust our available resources significantly sooner than we had planned  particularly given the termination of the amgen and sanofi synthelabo agreements 
if this were to happen  we would need to either raise additional funds or seek alternative partners to complete development and commercialization of plenaxis and continue our currently planned research and development programs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to raise the necessary funds or negotiate additional corporate collaborations on acceptable terms  if at all 
due to the termination by our corporate collaborators of their agreements with us  we may be unable to successfully develop  market  distribute or sell our product candidates 
we depended upon our corporate collaborators  amgen and sanofi synthelabo  to provide substantial financial support for the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
we relied on them to some extent in seeking regulatory approval for plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
in addition  under our agreement with amgen  they had assumed principal responsibility for the manufacture of plenaxis  and under our agreements with amgen and sanofi synthelabo  those parties were responsible for the marketing  distribution and sale of plenaxis in their respective licensed territories 
the termination of our agreements with amgen and sanofi synthelabo may delay or otherwise adversely affect or prevent the development or commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis 
we will likely need to devote funds and other resources to plenaxis development and commercialization that we had planned would be available from our collaborators 
this could require us to curtail or terminate one or more of our other drug development programs 
also  due to increased operating costs  lost revenue and a likely final payment to amgen associated with the termination of our agreements with them  we could have to seek additional funding to meet our capital requirements 
in addition  we may have to seek alternative partners to support the continued development and commercialization of plenaxis 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to raise the necessary funds or negotiate additional corporate collaborations on acceptable terms  if at all  and in that event we might have to curtail or cease operations 
even if we receive approval for the marketing and sale of our product candidates  they may fail to achieve market acceptance and  accordingly  may never be commercially successful 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of any of our potential products  including the scope of the patient population and the indications for which plenaxis or our other product candidates are approved  the effectiveness of plenaxis or any of our other product candidates  including any potential side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts relating to the marketing and sales of plenaxis or other potential products  the product labeling or product insert required by the fda for plenaxis and each of our other product candidates  the timing of market entry as compared to competitive products  the rate of adoption of plenaxis or our other product candidates by doctors and nurses and acceptance by the target patient population  the competitive features of our products as compared to other products  including the frequency of administration of plenaxis as compared to other products  and doctor and patient acceptance of these features  the cost effectiveness of plenaxis or our other product candidates and the availability of insurance or other third party reimbursement  in particular medicare  for patients using our products  and unfavorable publicity concerning plenaxis or any of our other product candidates or any similar products 
if our products are not commercially successful  we may never become profitable 
we may be unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and have very limited marketing and sales resources 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a marketing and sales force  as well as the infrastructure to support it  or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our products 
we may be unable to establish marketing  sales and distribution capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our potential products 
if we decide to market and sell our potential products  including plenaxis  independently  we would need to hire a sales force with expertise in pharmaceutical sales 
in that event  recruiting and retaining qualified sales personnel would be critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to successfully launch any potential product 
in addition  establishing the expertise necessary to successfully market and sell any product would require a substantial capital investment 
we cannot assure you that we would have the funds necessary to successfully commercialize plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer or any other potential product 
in the event that we decide to contract with third parties to provide sales force capabilities to meet our needs for plenaxis or any other product candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  co promotion or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize potential products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these potential products  and these third parties may fail to commercialize our potential products successfully 
to the extent we enter into any such agreements  the parties to those agreements may also market products that compete with our products  further limiting our potential revenue from product sales 
if we fail to develop and maintain our relationships with third party manufacturers  or if these manufacturers fail to perform adequately  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our ability to conduct  or continue to conduct  clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates  including plenaxis  will depend in part on our ability to manufacture  or arrange for third party manufacture of  our products on a large scale  at a competitive cost and in accordance with regulatory requirements 
we must establish and maintain a commercial scale formulation and manufacturing process for each of our potential products for which we seek marketing approval 
we or third party manufacturers may encounter difficulties with these processes at any time that could result in delays in clinical trials  regulatory submissions or in the commercialization of potential products 
we have no experience in large scale product manufacturing  nor do we have the resources or facilities to manufacture products on a commercial scale 
we will continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to produce plenaxis and other compounds for later stage preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes for a significant period of time 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs as to timing  quantity or quality of materials 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical trials may be delayed  thereby preventing or delaying the submission of product candidates for  or the granting of  regulatory approval and the market introduction and subsequent commercialization of our potential products 
any such delays may lower our revenues and potential profitability 
we may increase our manufacturing capacity in part by building our own manufacturing facilities 
this activity would require substantial expenditures  and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees to staff a new facility 
if we decide to build our own facility  we may not be able to develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to produce drug materials for clinical trials or commercial use 
in addition  we and the third party manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of third party manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of our product candidates will not be granted 
in complying with these regulations and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any of our third party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions 
if we make changes in our manufacturing processes  the fda and corresponding foreign authorities may require us to demonstrate that the changes have not caused the resulting drug material to differ significantly from the drug material previously produced 
also  we may want to rely on results of prior preclinical studies and clinical trials performed using the previously produced drug material 
depending on the type and degree of differences between the newer and older drug material  we may be required to conduct additional animal studies or human clinical trials to demonstrate that the newly produced drug material is sufficiently similar to the previously produced drug material 
any of these factors could prevent  or cause delays in  obtaining regulatory approvals for  and the manufacturing  marketing or selling of  our potential products  including plenaxis  and could also result in significantly higher operating expenses 
under our collaboration agreement with amgen  amgen had control over certain phases of the manufacturing process for plenaxis 
accordingly  amgen had either entered into or assumed from us agreements with third parties to perform  or was itself performing  these manufacturing processes 
due to the termination of our collaboration agreement with amgen  to assure an adequate supply of drug product for continued clinical studies and  if plenaxis is approved for marketing  for commercial sale  we will need to assume these manufacturing contracts from amgen  enter into new agreements with third party manufacturers or act as manufacturer ourselves 
we may elect not to  or may not be able to  assume the existing contracts from amgen  and we may be unable to make necessary alternative arrangements in a timely manner or on favorable terms  if at all 
moreover  to the extent we must make alternative supply arrangements  even if we are able to establish these arrangements in a timely manner  the use of a different manufacturer or the establishment of our own facility will require us to undergo additional regulatory review and compliance procedures which could result in additional expenses and further delay the regulatory review and potential commercialization of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer 
also  the establishment of our own facility could itself be costly thereby increasing our operating costs 
the loss or failure of any of our third party manufacturers could delay or impair our development  or our sale or continued sale  of plenaxis products 
for each stage of plenaxis production we have relied  and expect in the near term to continue to rely  on a separate third party manufacturer  and we currently have not contracted  and in the near term do not expect to contract  with second source suppliers for any of these production stages 
accordingly  the loss of one or more of these suppliers for any reason  including as a result of fire  acts of god or insolvency or bankruptcy  could result in delays in  or impair our ability to complete  clinical trials and regulatory submissions or reviews  and could delay or impair our sale or continued sale of plenaxis products 
such delays or impairment  and the associated costs and expenses  may lower our potential revenues and profitability 
while we intend to evaluate the possibility of a second source of supply at each stage of plenaxis production  the number of qualified alternative suppliers is limited  and we cannot assure investors that we will be able to locate alternative suppliers or negotiate second supply agreements on reasonable terms 
furthermore  the process of engineering a new supplier s facility for the production of plenaxis and obtaining the necessary fda approval of the facility would require a substantial lead time and could be extremely costly 
we cannot assure investors that we will not lose one or more of our suppliers  or that in such event we would be readily able to continue the development and commercialization and sale of plenaxis products without substantial and costly delays 
because we depend on third parties to conduct laboratory testing and human clinical studies and assist us with regulatory compliance  we may encounter delays in product development and commercialization 
we have contracts with a limited number of research organizations to design and conduct our laboratory testing and human clinical studies 
if we cannot contract for testing activities on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
to the extent we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human clinical studies  we may lose some control over these activities 
for example  third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we request them to do so 
in addition  these third parties may conduct our clinical trials in a manner inconsistent with regulatory requirements or otherwise in a manner that yields misleading or unreliable data 
this  or other failures of these third parties to carry out their duties  could result in significant additional costs and expenses and could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
alternative treatments are available which may impair our ability to capture market share for our potential products 
alternative products exist or are under development to treat the diseases for which we are developing drugs 
for example  the fda has approved several drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer that responds to changes in hormone levels 
even if the fda approves plenaxis for commercialization for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer  the approval could be limited to a particular group of patients or to administration over a limited period of time  and plenaxis may not compete favorably with existing treatments that already have an established market share 
if plenaxis does not achieve broad market acceptance as a drug for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer  we may not become profitable 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products and technologies obsolete or non competitive 
a biotechnology company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that all of our products under development will face intense competition from existing or future drugs 
in addition  for each of our product candidates  we may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
our competitors may successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or successfully market products that compete with our products 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to develop  commercialize and market our product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain and enforce valid patents  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our technologies and potential products 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode any competitive advantage we may have 
for example  if we lose our patent protection for plenaxis  another party could produce and market the compound in direct competition with us 
some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states 
many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in foreign countries 
patent positions are sometimes uncertain and usually involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we currently own or have exclusively licensed issued united states patents 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering both our technologies and products as we deem appropriate 
others may challenge our patent applications or our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  any issued patents on our own inventions  or those licensed from third parties  may not provide us with adequate protection  or others may challenge the validity of  or seek to narrow or circumvent  these patents 
third party patents may impair or block our ability to conduct our business 
additionally  third parties may independently develop products similar to our products  duplicate our unpatented products  or design around any patented products we develop 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information 
these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if these measures do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have 
in addition  others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques  which could impair any competitive advantage we may have 
if our technologies  processes or potential products conflict with the patents of competitors  universities or others  we could have to engage in costly litigation and be unable to commercialize those products 
our technologies  processes or potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe other patents 
a third party could force us to pay damages  stop our use of these technologies or processes  or stop our manufacturing or marketing of the affected products by bringing a legal action against us for infringement 
in addition  a third party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technologies or processes or manufacture or market the affected products  and we may not be able to do so 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
even if legal actions were meritless  defending a lawsuit could take significant time  be expensive and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
if third parties terminate our licenses  we could experience delays or be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our potential products 
we license some of our technology from third parties 
termination of our licenses could force us to delay or discontinue some of our development and commercialization programs 
for example  if advanced research and technology institute  the assignee of indiana university foundation  terminated our license with them  we could have to discontinue development and commercialization of our plenaxis products 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to license substitute technology in the future 
our inability to do so could impair our ability to conduct our business because we may lack the technology  or the necessary rights to technology  required to develop and commercialize our potential products 
our potential revenues will diminish if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our commercial opportunity 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  physicians may not prescribe them 
if we are unable to offer physicians comparable or superior financial motivation to use our products  we may not be able to generate significant revenues 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any products in the future 
further  cost control initiatives could impair or diminish our ability or incentive  or the ability or incentive of potential partners  to commercialize our products  and our ability to earn revenues from this commercialization 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products  alone or with collaborators  may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for our products from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  and other third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
we cannot predict the availability of reimbursement for newly approved health care products 
third party payors  including medicare  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and  in some cases  refusing to provide coverage for a patient s use of an approved drug for purposes not approved by the fda 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our products 
we may be unable to find suitable tenants for a portion of our facility 
in may  we moved to a new  square foot facility in waltham  massachusetts 
we are currently seeking to sublease a portion of our new facility to third parties 
we may not be able to find suitable sub tenants to occupy this space in a timely manner  if at all 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants in a timely manner  we may not be able to partially offset with rental income the substantial mortgage payments and other operating expenses associated with our facility 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including malcolm l 
gefter  phd  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work also will be critical to our success 
competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high 
we compete with numerous companies and academic and other research institutions for experienced scientists 
this competition may limit our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel would prevent us from continuing to develop our potential products  enhancing our technologies and launching our products commercially 
our planned activities may require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the inability to retain these personnel or to develop this expertise could prevent  or result in delays in  the research  development and commercialization of our potential products 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be held liable if any product we develop  or any product made by others using our technologies  causes injury 
we have only limited product liability insurance coverage for our potential products in clinical trials 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage for any of our products for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
our collaboration agreements with amgen and sanofi synthelabo included  and we anticipate that the agreements we are finalizing with them regarding the termination of those collaborations will include  an indemnification of them for liabilities associated with the development and commercialization of plenaxis 
if a third party  including a former collaborator  sues us for any injury  or for indemnification for losses  arising out of products made by us or using our technologies  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and any claims relating to the handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
for example  the health risks associated with accidental exposure to plenaxis include temporary impotence or infertility and harmful effects on pregnant women 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge from hazardous materials and any resultant injury 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is necessary and expensive 
current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
we may be required to pay fines  penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance or the exposure of individuals to hazardous materials 
from time to time  third parties have also worked with hazardous materials in connection with our agreements with them 
we have agreed to indemnify our present and former collaborators in some circumstances against damages and other liabilities arising out of development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations 
if we engage in an acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire businesses  or acquire or in license products or technologies  that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
we currently have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  nor are there any negotiations as to any specific transaction 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired business  or an acquired or in licensed product or technology  may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction of this sort 
to the extent we issue stock in a transaction  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
transactions of this kind could also cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the market price of our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to announcement of fda approval or disapproval of plenaxis for the treatment of hormonally responsive advanced prostate cancer or any of our other product candidates  failure or delay by former or future corporate collaborators in performing their obligations  or disputes or litigation regarding those obligations  failure or delay by third party manufacturers in performing their supply obligations or disputes or litigation regarding those obligations  the success rate of our discovery efforts and clinical trials  our ability or the ability of third parties to commercialize our product candidates and the timing of commercialization  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including announcements of claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  announcements concerning our competitors  or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry in general  public concerns as to the safety of our products or our competitors products  changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  sales of large blocks of our common stock  changes in accounting principles  and the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies  particularly companies like ours without current product revenues and earnings  have been highly volatile  and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing and level of expenses related to the development and commercialization of our plenaxis products leading to revenues from product sales  the timing and level of expenses related to our other research and development programs  and the timing of our commercialization of other products resulting in revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and by laws  our rights agreement and certain provisions of delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
also  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
in addition  the rights issued under our rights agreement may be a substantial deterrent to a person acquiring or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions in our charter and by laws  rights agreement and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower that it would be without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
in connection with the purchase of our new facility in july  our wholly owned real estate subsidiary executed an acquisition and construction loan agreement that provides for up to million in borrowings at a floating interest rate indexed to day libor 
concurrent with that transaction  the subsidiary also entered into an interest rate cap agreement which limits exposure to interest rate increases above a certain threshold 
due to the decrease in interest rates since we entered into this interest rate cap  we currently do not believe that there is material interest rate risk exposure with respect to the loan agreement 
in addition  we believe that we have mitigated our risk relating to significant adverse fluctuations in interest rates with respect to borrowings under the loan agreement  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
