item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we were incorporated in august as a delaware corporation and are located in alviso  california 
on august   tivo uk ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of tivo inc  was incorporated in the united kingdom 
on october  we formed a new subsidiary  tivo international  inc  also a delaware corporation 
the tivo service is a subscription based television service that provides viewers with greater control  easier navigation and a wider range of viewing options when watching television 
the tivo service also provides television content providers and advertisers with a new platform for content delivery  interactive viewing options and in home commerce 
the tivo service is enabled through a personal video recorder designed and developed by tivo 
we launched the personal video recorder and service into the retail channel in the second half of calendar year we incurred losses of million in calendar year  million for the one month transition period ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended january   and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we currently generate revenues from the following sources subscription revenue  non subscription revenue  licensing revenue and engineering professional services revenue 
subscriptions to the tivo service are available on a monthly or lifetime basis 
the current price for a monthly subscription to the tivo service is and the price for a lifetime subscription is 
as of april   the price for a monthly subscription for stand alone recorders will increase to 
a lifetime subscription allows access to the tivo service for the life of the personal video recorder 
subscription fees are paid by the viewer when activating the tivo service 
subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions are recognized ratably over a four year period  our best estimate of the useful life of the personal video recorder 
deferred revenue relates to subscription fees collected  for which service has not yet been provided 
since the tivo service is enabled through a personal video recorder that is sold in retail channels like other consumer electronic devices  we anticipate that our business will be seasonal and we expect to generate a significant number of our annual new subscriptions during the holiday shopping season 
non subscription revenue primarily includes charter advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer companies and media networks that have provided content on the tivo service 
revenue is recognized as the advertising and content is delivered 
to date  our non subscription revenue has not been significant 
licensing revenue consists of revenues generated from licensing our technology to consumer electronics companies and service providers for the purpose of creating an open standards platform design for digital video recorders dvr 
at this time  tivo has signed one licensing agreement 
see item b 
note 
engineering professional services revenue includes revenues earned for engineering services performed 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our strategic partners in order to promote the tivo service and encourage the manufacture and distribution of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
these agreements may require us to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscriber with multiple partners 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that our partnerships will help us obtain subscribers  broaden market acceptance of personal television and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
expenses related to our strategic partners in exchange for marketing services and who are also stockholders are recognized as sales and marketing related parties expense 
expenses related to our partners in exchange for marketing services who are not our stockholders are recognized as sales and marketing expense see item note and item note 
in the past  we have issued stock in exchange for services to our strategic partners 
for example  tivo closed an investment agreement with aol for million 
the aol investment is part of a three year strategic production integration and marketing agreement between aol and tivo  in which tivo was to become an aol tv programming partner offering aol tv subscribers access to features of the tivo service 
in return for aol s investment  tivo issued to aol a combination of convertible redeemable preferred stock  a portion of common stock subject to redemption  common stock and initial and performance warrants see item note 
we have issued convertible notes in exchange for services to our strategic partners 
in august  we closed a private placement of million of convertible debt  tivo received cash proceeds of approximately million from noteholders and non cash proceeds of million in the form of advertising and promotional services from discovery communications  inc discovery and the national broadcasting company  inc nbc  who are existing stockholders 
issuance costs were approximately million  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
of the total proceeds of million  million is designated for advertising and promotional services 
in addition  the company paid million in october to nbc for advertising that ran for the period that began october  and ended december  see item note 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended january   we sold shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes 
on january   we sold to acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
 shares of our common stock at per share  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement we entered into with acqua wellington on december  our net proceeds from this sale were approximately million  after deducting our estimated sales expenses 
in  we expect to experience a transition period related to certain sales of our series platform  including those through best buy and directly by tivo 
we consider these sales as incidental to our business and  as a result  anticipate reporting such transactions as other operating expense  net  during the upcoming year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see item note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition of lifetime subscriptions based on the guidance provided by securities and exchange commission sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have completed our service obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our service obligation or customer acceptance obligations 
subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions are recognized ratably over a four year period  our best estimate of the useful life of the personal video recorder 
if the useful life of the recorder was shorter or longer than the estimated four year period  revenues would be recognized earlier or later  respectively  than our current policy 
our product is still relatively new and as more user information is gathered  this estimated life could be revised 
complex agreements tivo has a number of related party transactions and commitments 
many of these transactions are complex and involve multiple elements and types of consideration  including cash  debt  equity  and services 
the company has utilized its best estimate of the value of the various elements in accounting for these transactions 
had alternative assumptions been used  the values obtained may have been materially different 
the company recognizes revenue under its technology license and engineering professional services agreement with sony corporation in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position   software revenue recognition sap 
this agreement constitutes a multiple element arrangement in which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is required for all undelivered elements in order to recognize license revenue 
the company has not established vsoe on undelivered elements of the arrangement and must defer revenue related to this arrangement until all elements have been delivered 
the company intends to enter into additional technology licensing transactions in the future  and the timing of revenue recognition related to these transactions will depend  in part  on whether the company can establish vsoe and on how these deals are structured 
as such  revenue recognition may not correspond to the timing of related cash flows or tivo s work effort 
stock based compensation we have a history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
generally accepted accounting principles allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
we have chosen to account for our stock option plans under apb opinion  which requires that only the intrinsic value of stock option grants be recognized as an expense on the statement of operations 
accordingly  no compensation expense related to the time value of stock options is included in determining net loss and net loss per share in the consolidated financial statements 
the alternative method of accounting for stock options is prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and requires that both the intrinsic value and time value of options be recognized as an expense for employee stock option awards 
note to the consolidated financial statements sets forth calculations of pro forma net loss and net loss per share computed in accordance with this alternative method 
had we used sfas no 
to value our employee stock option awards  our net loss and net loss per share would have been greater for all periods presented 
assumptions on non cash expenses several of our arrangements require tivo to make estimations and assumptions for the valuation of non cash expenses 
for example  under the aol agreements we calculate the estimated fair market value of the aol initial common stock warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
several assumptions are made in the model such as the term and risk free rate of return 
if the market conditions at the time aol earns the initial common stock warrants are different then date on which the assumptions are based  the valuation of the initial common stock warrants could significantly increase or decrease from the estimated calculation and our expense would be different 
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets we provided a valuation allowance of million and million against our entire net deferred tax primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards as of january  and the valuation allowance was recorded given the losses we incurred through january  and our uncertainties regarding future operating profitability and taxable income 
if we do not achieve profitability we will not fully realize the deferred tax benefits 
as of january   the company has the following contractual cash obligation payments less than s in s total year years years over years contractual cash obligations long term convertible debt   interest on long term convertible debt     capital lease obligations operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     other commercial commitments as of january   expiration per period are as follows less than s in s total year years years over years other commercial commitments standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   results of operations on february   tivo announced a fiscal year end change from december of each year to january of each year 
tivo believes that the change in fiscal year will help align the seasonal patterns of demand in tivo s business with its reporting cycle and better align tivo s promotional activities with those of its retail  service and network partners 
the following discussion of historical operating results compares the year ended january  to the previous fiscal year ended january  additionally  the one month transition period ended january  and the twelve month period ended january  are compared to the same periods in the prior year

on january   we sold to acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
 shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to an effective registration statement on form s file no 

our net proceeds from this sale were approximately million  after deducting the estimated sale expenses payable by us 
during february  we entered into a second common stock purchase agreement which  under certain circumstances  may allow us to sell to acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
up to million of our common stock during the fourteen month period ending april  we view this purchase agreement as an auxiliary financing tool with the potential to provide us with an efficient and flexible mechanism to raise cash to fund our working capital needs 
the shares of common stock which we may sell pursuant to the purchase agreement are registered under the securities act of pursuant to an effective registration statement on form s file no 

from time to time  we may present acqua wellington with draw down notices over a draw down period consisting of two periods of ten consecutive trading days each  unless we agree otherwise with acqua wellington 
each draw down notice sets forth a threshold price and the dollar value of shares acqua wellington is obligated to purchase during the draw down period 
the threshold price we choose  which cannot be less than without the consent of acqua wellington  establishes the maximum value of the stock we can obligate acqua wellington to buy during the period and the discount that acqua wellington will receive  unless we agree otherwise with acqua wellington 
once presented with a draw down notice  acqua wellington is required to purchase a pro rata portion of the shares on each trading day during the draw down period on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeds the threshold price determined by us 
the per share purchase price for the shares equals the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on the threshold price  unless we agree otherwise with acqua wellington 
if the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock falls below the threshold price on any trading day during a draw down period  acqua wellington will not be obligated but still may purchase the pro rata portion of shares of common stock allocated to that day at the threshold price for the draw down period  less the discount 
the number of shares acqua wellington would be obligated to buy on any trading day during a draw down period is arrived at by dividing that day s pro rata part of the total purchase amount by that day s volume weighted average price  less acqua wellington s discount 
the total number of shares acqua wellington would be required to purchase during a draw down period is the aggregate of the daily amounts 
the purchase agreement also provides that from time to time and at our discretion we may grant acqua wellington the right to exercise one or more call options to purchase additional shares of our common stock during each draw down period for the amount that we specify  so long as the aggregate of all such call option amounts and draw down amounts under the purchase agreement do not exceed  upon acqua wellington s exercise of the call option  we will issue and sell the shares of our common stock subject to the call option at a price equal to the greater of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on the day acqua wellington notifies us of its election to exercise its call option or the threshold price for the call option determined by us and set forth in the draw down notice  less a discount ranging from to  based on the threshold price  unless we agree otherwise with acqua wellington 
the purchase agreement further provides that if  during a draw down period with acqua wellington  we enter into an agreement with a third party to issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock  the principal purpose of which is to raise capital  acqua wellington will have the option to purchase shares of the draw down amount and any call option amounts requested by us at the price otherwise applicable to the sale to acqua wellington  or at the third party s price 
acqua wellington may also decide not to purchase the shares during that draw down period 
if  between draw down pricing periods  we enter into an agreement with a third party to issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock  the principal purpose of which is to raise capital  acqua wellington will have the option to purchase up to the draw down amount that would be applicable based on the gross price per share to be paid for the common stock in the other financing on the same terms and conditions contemplated in the other financing  net of the third party s discount and fees  or  if the applicable share price is below the minimum threshold price  up to of the total amount to be raised by us in the other financing 
under the terms of the investment agreement between america online  inc aol and tivo  dated june   as amended  the company holds million in an interest bearing escrow account as restricted cash 
if the aol tv tivo set top box launch does not occur by december  or a later date agreed to by both parties  and aol has not committed a material breach of the commercial agreement or if we have breached our obligations with respect to the financial covenants  then aol has a put option pursuant to which aol could require tivo to repurchase up to million shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock at a liquidation value of up to million

at this point  we have not agreed with aol on this agreed upon launch date as we believe that aol does not plan to deploy the aol tv tivo set top box as originally envisioned 
we are in discussions with aol regarding modification of the terms of the current agreements  including product definition  development funding  deployment  launch date  and other commercial terms 
there can be no assurances about the outcome of these discussions 
if the outcome includes exercise of the put option  our cash and cash equivalents would increase by million  reflecting the deferred interest on the restricted cash  and the restricted cash balance would be reduced to zero 
we do not include restricted cash in our calculations of working capital available for operations 
as a result  we do not expect that the preferred stock repurchase would have a material effect on our business operations 
additionally  under the terms of the aol investment agreement  we must maintain a positive net cash position in excess of million  measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
net cash is defined as consolidated current assets excluding deferred tax assets and escrowed funds minus consolidated current liabilities excluding deferred revenue  deferred interest income on escrowed funds  sublessee prepaid rent and leasing obligations 
we advise aol monthly  on an informational basis  of our net cash position 
per the agreement  if we fall below the million net cash position at the end of our fiscal quarter  aol has the right to exercise its put option 
we was in compliance with the net cash position requirement as of january  the financial covenants shall terminate upon the earlier of the date of the set top box launch  so long as such set top box launch occurs before the agreed upon launch date  the expiration of the put option or the day following the first anniversary of the agreed upon launch date 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended january  during this same period  we continued to provide the tivo service  incurring a net loss of million 
uses of cash from operating activities included a decrease in accrued liabilities related parties of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  an increase in prepaid expenses related parties of million  an increase in notes payable related parties of million  an increase in accounts receivable related parties of million and an increase in accounts receivable of  these uses were offset by sources of cash provided from operating activities consisting of an increase in long term deferred revenue of million  an increase in deferred revenue related parties of million  and increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in other long term liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  was million for the acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended january  of this amount  million was used for payment of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock dividend and  was used for payment on a capital lease 
we obtained million  less cash financing expense of million  of financing as proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable on august  we obtained million  less cash financing expense of  for the sale of common stock to acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
on january  an additional million of financing was obtained as proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan   from the issuance of common stock for stock options exercised and  of financing was obtained from the reduction of financing expenses related to the aol investment agreement 
we have commitments for future lease payments under facilities operating leases of million and obligations under capital leases of  as of january  the obligations under the capital lease relate to equipment leased under a total available lease line of million  which expired in february although payments under the operating lease for our facility are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with the operating lease 
our capital lease obligations are not subject to changes in the interest rate and  therefore  are not exposed to interest rate risk 
the conversion price of our convertible notes will be reduced on august  if the conversion price is greater then the average closing price per share of our commons stock for the consecutive trading days preceding august  in addition  the conversion price on the notes may be reduced if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents at an issuance price or with respect to common stock equivalents  such additional stock is issued with a conversion or exercise price per share less than the conversion price of the notes then in effect immediately prior to the issuance that is lower than the conversion price then in effect immediately prior to the issuance 
a reduced conversion price on the convertible notes would increase our interest expense our future capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors  including market acceptance of the personal video recorder and the tivo service  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources 
to develop new or enhance existing services or products  
to continue support of our customer call center  
for advertising to educated consumers  
to continue to support our existing efforts in the united kingdom market  and 
for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
despite our expectations  we may need to raise additional capital before the end of the next months 
in addition  in order to meet long term liquidity needs  we may need to raise additional funds  establish a credit facility or seek other financing arrangements 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
see factors that may affect future operating results if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects we have recognized very limited revenue  have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have recognized limited revenue  have incurred significant losses and have had substantial negative cash flow 
during the fiscal year ended january   the one month transition period ended january  and the calendar year ended december   we recognized revenues of million   and million  respectively 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
the size of these net losses depends in part on our subscriber revenues and on our expenses 
with increased expenses  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
consequently  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our limited operating history may make it difficult for us or investors to evaluate trends and other factors that affect our business 
we were incorporated in august and have been obtaining subscribers only since march  prior to that time  our operations consisted primarily of research and development efforts 
as of january   only a limited number of personal video recorders had been sold and we obtained only a limited number of subscribers to the tivo service 
as a result of our limited operating history  our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in evaluating our future operating results 
in addition  any evaluation of our business must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new and rapidly evolving markets 
for example  it may be difficult to accurately predict our future revenues  costs of revenues  expenses or results of operations 
personal television is a new product category for consumers and it may be difficult to predict the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
this inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
if our marketing in the retail channel is not successful  consumers and consumer electronics manufacturers may not accept the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon a continually successful retail marketing campaign for the tivo service and related personal video recorders  which began in the third quarter of calendar year we rely in part on our consumer electronics partners to manufacture  market  sell and support the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
we also rely on the efforts of at t broadband  directv and bskyb to market  sell and support the tivo service to at t broadband  directv and bskyb subscribers 
the ongoing marketing campaign requires  among other things  that we 
educate consumers on the benefits of the tivo service and related personal video recorder  which will require an extensive marketing campaign  
commit a substantial amount of human and financial resources to achieve continued  successful retail distribution  and 
coordinate our own sales  marketing and support activities with those of at t broadband  directv  aol and other strategic partners 
we or our strategic partners may not achieve any or all of these objectives 
in addition  consumers may perceive the tivo service and related personal video recorder as too expensive or complex and our marketing campaign may not effectively attract new subscribers 
because of competitive offerings or changing preferences  consumers may delay or decline the purchase of the tivo service and related personal video recorder 
all of these events would reduce consumer demand and market acceptance  diminish our brand and impair our ability to attract subscribers to the tivo service 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our strategic partners 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our strategic partners in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and marketing support and discounts on key components for personal video recorders 
given how these amounts are calculated  we may be required to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscriber with multiple partners 
these agreements require us to share a portion of our subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we change our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that our partnerships will help us obtain subscribers  broaden market acceptance of personal television and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute and supply critical components and services for the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a personal video recorder made available by tivo and a limited number of third parties 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the personal video recorders 
we do not control the time and resources that these third parties devote to our business 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and quickly achieve market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing partnerships are not successful  we may be unable to establish a market for our products and services 
we have manufactured a certain number of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
we have also entered and anticipate entering into agreements with consumer electronics partners to manufacture and distribute the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
however  we have no minimum volume commitments from any manufacturer 
the ability of our manufacturing partners to reach sufficient production volume of the personal video recorder to satisfy anticipated demand is subject to delays and unforeseen problems such as defects  shortages of critical components and cost overruns 
moreover  they will require substantial lead times to manufacture anticipated quantities of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
delays  product shortages  and other problems could impair the retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscribers 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturing partner would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do and which could prove time consuming and expensive 
although we expect to continue to contract with additional consumer electronics companies for the manufacture of personal video recorders in the future  we may be unable to establish additional relationships on acceptable terms 
if our corporate partners fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products and services 
in addition to our efforts  our manufacturing partners distribute the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote and support the personal video recorder and the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our manufacturing partners and other strategic partners to promote and support the personal video recorder and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these partners could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support personal video recorders and other devices that enable the tivo service 
we also expect to rely on aol  at t broadband  directv and other partners to provide marketing support for the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these partners to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for the personal video recorder and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscribers to the tivo service will be limited 
we are dependent on single suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components and services used in the personal video recorders and the tivo service 
for example 
nec is the sole supplier of the cpu and application specific integrated circuit  semiconductor devices  
broadcom is the sole supplier of the mpeg encoder and decoder semiconductor devices  
atmel is the sole supplier of the secure microcontroller semiconductor device  and 
tribune media services is the sole supplier of program guide data 
in addition to the above  we have several sole suppliers for key components of our products currently under development 
we cannot be sure that alternative sources for key components and services used in the personal video recorders and the tivo service will be available when needed or  if available  that these components and services will be available on favorable terms 
if our agreements or our manufacturing partners agreements with broadcom  atmel  nec or tribune media services were to terminate or expire  or if we or our manufacturing partners were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or required program guide data  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product availability 
we have limited experience in overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory and failure to do so effectively may result in supply imbalances 
in fiscal year ending january   to transition to the series platform  we will contract for the manufacture of certain series personal video recorders with contract manufacturers 
we will sell these units through best buy and at t broadband  as well as through tivo s own online sales efforts 
as part of this effort  we expect to maintain some inventory of the series units throughout the year 
overseeing manufacturing processes and managing inventory are outside of tivo s core business and our experience in these areas is limited 
if tivo fails to effectively oversee manufacturing process and manage inventory  tivo may suffer from insufficient inventory to meet consumer demand or excess inventory 
our ability to generate revenues from subscription fees is unproven and may fail 
we expect to generate a substantial portion of our revenues from subscription fees for the tivo service 
many of our potential customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television services 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees will harm our ability to effectively attract subscribers 
in addition  the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service can be used to record programs and pause  rewind and fast forward through live or recorded shows without an active subscription to the tivo service 
if a significant number of purchasers of the personal video recorders use these devices without subscribing to the tivo service  our revenue growth will decline and we may not achieve profitability 
our business is expanding and our failure to manage growth could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
since we began our business in august  we have expanded our operations 
we may need to adjust our headcount and infrastructure to allow us to pursue market opportunities 
this growth in our subscriber base has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include we need to attract and retain qualified personnel  and any failure to do so may impair our ability to offer new products or grow our business 
our success will depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate managerial  technical  marketing  financial  administrative and customer support personnel 
competition for such employees is intense  especially for engineers in the san francisco bay area  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire  train  retain and manage required personnel  we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or otherwise implement our business strategy 
any inability of our systems to accommodate our expected subscriber growth may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we rapidly add new subscribers is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscriber growth and add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
we will need to provide acceptable customer support  and any inability to do so will harm our brand and ability to generate and retain new subscribers 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscribers and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
some customers require significant support when installing the personal video recorder and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products and services to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service and personal video recorder will damage our reputation in the personal television and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and strategic partners 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscribers and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth  and any inability to do so will adversely impact our billing and reporting 
to manage the expected growth of our operations  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations and expected growth 
for example  we replaced our accounting and billing system at the beginning of august delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely impact our relationships with subscribers and cause harm to our reputation and brand 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
if we are unable to create multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses or meet our obligations to strategic partners and other third parties 
although our initial success will depend on building a significant customer base and generating subscription fees from the tivo service  our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue streams such as 
advertising  
audience measurement research  
revenues from programmers  and 
electronic commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscribers to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to effectively work with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscribers and strategic partners will seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 
it will take a substantial amount of time and resources to achieve broad market acceptance of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service and we cannot be sure that these efforts will generate a broad enough subscriber base to sustain our business 
personal television products and services represent a new  untested consumer electronics category 
the tivo service is in an early stage of development and many consumers are not aware of its benefits 
as a result  it is uncertain whether the market will demand and accept the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
retailers  consumers and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from personal television products and services 
likewise  consumers may not value  and may be unwilling to pay for the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
to develop this market and obtain subscribers to the tivo service  we will need to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products 
we may fail to obtain subscribers  encourage the development of new devices that enable the tivo service and develop and offer new content and services 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues and ability to generate subscribers 
the personal television market is new and rapidly evolving and we expect competition from a number of sources  including companies offering similar products and services 
we are likely to face intense direct competition from companies such as microsoft  opentv  nds  echostar communications corp  cachevision  keen personal media  inc  moxi digital and sonicblue 
these companies offer  or have announced their intention to offer  products with one or more of the tivo service s functions or features and  in some instances  combine these features with internet browsing or traditional broadcast  cable or satellite television programming 
many of these companies have greater brand recognition and market presence and substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
for example  microsoft corporation controls and provides financial backing to ultimatetv 
some of these companies also have established relationships with third party consumer electronic manufacturers  network operators and programmers  which could make it difficult for us to establish relationships and enter into agreements with these third parties 
some of these competitors also have relationships with our strategic partners 
for example  directv enables its subscribers to receive microsoft s ultimatetv service 
aol time warner has made an investment in moxi digital 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to expand our market share and attract an increasing number of subscribers to the tivo service 
established competitors in the consumer electronics market 
we compete with consumer electronic products in the television and home entertainment industry 
the television and home entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation  a small number of dominant manufacturers and intense price competition 
as a new product category  personal television enters a market that is crowded with several established products and services 
the competition for consumer spending in the television and home entertainment market is intense  and our products and services compete with 
satellite television systems  
video on demand services  
digital video disc players  and 
laser disc players 
most of these technologies or devices have established markets  a broad subscriber base and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate the personal video recorder or the tivo service from these devices 
established competition for advertising budgets 
personal television  in general  and tivo  specifically  also compete with traditional advertising media such as print  radio and television for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive personal television as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to promotions on the tivo service 
if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscriber base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscribers and generate revenues  we must continue to add functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for personal television 
if we are unable to further develop and improve the tivo service or expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain subscribers and generate revenue will suffer 
if we do not successfully establish strong brand identity in the personal television market  we may be unable to achieve widespread acceptance of our products 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic partnerships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the personal television market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscribers or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscribers and effectively compete in the personal television market 
product defects  system failures or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new subscribers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects 
these problems can affect system uptime  result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the personal video recorders and the tivo service 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
from time to time  we receive letters form third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property 
if any of these third parties or others were to bring suit against us  our business could be harmed because intellectual property litigation may 
be time consuming and expensive  
divert management s attention and resources away from our business  
cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  
cause the cancellation of new products or services  or 
require us to pay significant royalties or licensing fees 
the emerging enhanced television industry is highly litigious  particularly in the area of on screen program guides 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
for example  we are aware of at least seven patents for pausing live television 
a number of companies in the enhanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies such as ours is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturing partners to cease manufacturing the personal video recorder  our retailers to stop selling the product or us to cease providing our service  or all of the above  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
on january   starsight telecast inc  a subsidiary of gemstar international group limited filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging willful and deliberate violation of us patent number  entitled tv schedule system and process  held by starsight 
the complaint alleged that we infringed the patent by  among other things  making  using  selling  offering to sell and or importing our tv schedule systems and processes without a license from starsight 
starsight seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against our operations 
the suit also seeks attorneys fees and costs 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses against the suit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
on february   we counterclaimed against starsight  gemstar development corporation and gemstar international group limited seeking damages for federal antitrust violations and state unfair business practices claims  as well as declaratory relief of non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability with respect to the patent 
we could be forced to incur material expenses during this litigation  and in the event we were to lose this suit  our business would be harmed 
on september   pause technology filed a complaint against tivo in the us district court for the district of massachusetts alleging willful and deliberate infringement of us reissue patent no 
 entitled time delayed digital video system using concurrent recording and playback 
pause technology seeks unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against our operations 
it also seeks attorneys fees and costs 
tivo s answer was filed on december  we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
on december   sonicblue incorporated filed a lawsuit against tivo in the us district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement of us patent no 
 entitled video data recorder with integrated channel guides 
sonicblue seeks unspecified monetary damages as well as an injunction against our operations 
tivo s answer was filed on january  we believe that we have meritorious defenses against this suit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
however  we could be forced to incur material expenses during this litigation and  in the event we were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
on january   we filed a separate lawsuit against sonicblue incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiary  replaytv  inc  in the us district court for the northern district of california  alleging that we are the owner of united states patent no 
 entitled multimedia time warping system  and alleging further that sonicblue and replaytv have willfully and deliberately infringed the patent by making  using  offering to sell and or selling within the united states digital video recording devices  software and or personal television services falling within the scope of the patent 
we have requested that the court enjoin sonicblue and replaytv from further infringement of the patent and award us compensatory damages  treble damages and attorneys fees and costs 
we could be forced to incur material expenses during this litigation and  in the event we were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
on february   sony corporation notified us that command audio corporation had filed a complaint against sony electronics  inc on february  in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the complaint alleges that  in connection with its sale of personal video recorders  sony infringes upon two patents owned by command audio united states patent nos 
 information dissemination using various transmission modes and  method and system for information dissemination using television signals 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief  compensatory and treble damages and command audio s costs and expenses  including reasonable attorneys fees 
under the terms of our agreement with sony governing the distribution of certain personal video recorders that enable the tivo service  we are required to indemnify sony against any and all claims  damages  liabilities  costs and expenses relating to claims that our technology infringes upon intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we believe sony has meritorious defenses against this lawsuit  however  due to our indemnification obligations  we could be forced to incur material expenses during this litigation  and  if sony were to lose this lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the personal television industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the personal television industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
a number of articles have appeared in the press regarding the formation of a consortium of broadcast and cable television networks called the advanced television copyright coalition 
some of those articles have indicated that the coalition is prepared to support litigation and to explore legislative solutions unless the members of the personal television industry agree to obtain license agreements for use of the companies programming 
we have received letters from time warner inc and fox television stating that these entities believe our personal television service exploits copyrighted networks and programs without the necessary licenses and business arrangements 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our use of some television content  increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our proprietary rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering substantially all of the technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  several of these patents have been granted  and we cannot assure you that any additional patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
laws or regulations that govern the television industry and the delivery of programming could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply or could require us to change our business 
personal television and the delivery of television programming through the tivo service and a personal video recorder represents a new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate  the enactment of new legislation or the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could require changes to our business 
for example  copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the personal television market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the majority of fcc regulations  while not directly affecting us  do affect many of the strategic partners on whom we substantially rely for the marketing and distribution of the personal video recorder and the tivo service 
as such  the indirect effect of these regulations may adversely affect our business 
in addition  the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter the features or functionality of the tivo service 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscribers confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the personal video recorder collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our subscribers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscribers confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscribers could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and personal video recorder 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our subscribers viewing choices while using the tivo service  unless a subscriber affirmatively consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual subscriber 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for personal television and our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 
demand for personal video recorders and the tivo service  
the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  
seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  
changes in revenue sharing arrangements with our strategic partners  
entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  
changes in the subsidy payments we make to certain strategic partners  
changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  
loss of subscribers to the tivo service  and 
general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenue could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we have experienced that sales of personal video recorders and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 
if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
we have agreed to subsidize the cost of manufacturing personal video recorders  which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to achieve profitability 
we have entered into agreements with our consumer electronic manufacturing partners to manufacture the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
although we intend to reduce subsidy payments in the future  in certain agreements we have agreed to pay our manufacturing partners a per unit subsidy for each personal video recorder that they manufacture and sell 
the amount of the payments can vary depending upon the manufacturing costs and selling prices 
in addition  in the event our manufacturing partners are unable to manufacture the personal video recorders at the costs currently estimated or if selling prices are less than anticipated  we may owe additional amounts to them  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are obligated to pay a portion of the subsidy when the personal video recorder is shipped  and we will not receive any revenues related to the unit until the unit is sold and the purchaser activates the tivo service 
we may make additional subsidy payments in the future to consumer electronic and other manufacturers in an effort to maintain a commercially viable retail price for the personal video recorders and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently offer commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs 
we currently offer product lifetime subscriptions that commit us to provide service for as long as the personal video recorder is in service 
we receive the lifetime subscription fee for the tivo service in advance and amortize it as subscription revenue over four years  which is our estimate of the service life of the personal video recorder 
if these lifetime subscribers use the personal video recorder for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs without a corresponding revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources 
if we lose key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of any members of our executive management team and our inability to hire additional executive management could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we do not have employment agreements with  or key man insurance policies for  any of our key personnel 
if there is an adverse outcome in either class action litigation that has been filed against tivo  our business may be harmed 
on june   a securities class action lawsuit in which we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
in addition to the tivo defendants  this action  which is captioned wercberger v 
tivo et al  also names several of the underwriters involved in our initial public offering as defendants 
this class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock from september   the time of our initial public offering  through december  the central allegation in this action is that the underwriters in our initial public offering solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with  certain investors who purchased our common stock in the initial public offering and the after market 
the complaint also alleges that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the initial public offering prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these allegedly undisclosed arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
the tivo defendants time to respond to the complaint has not yet expired  and it is likely that this response will not be due for several months  after certain procedural issues are resolved 
at the appropriate time  the tivo defendants intend to move to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to state a claim 
we believe that the defendants have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
on august   alan federbush  an individual resident in the state of new york  and mitchell brink  an individual resident in the state of illinois  filed  on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated purchasers of sony or philips digital television recorders and the tivo service  a class action complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california  santa clara county  alleging violation of california s consumers legal remedies act  california s unfair practices act  and fraudulent concealment 
the complaint states that mr 
federbush and mr 
brink each experienced problems with the modem contained in the digital television recorders 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that we knew or had reason to know of these malfunctions and therefore misrepresented or failed to disclose material information about the digital television recorders to consumers 
the complaint seeks an award of actual damages  as well as unspecified punitive damages  interest  attorneys fees and other costs 
the complaint additionally seeks broad equitable relief  requesting that we be enjoined from continuing the practices described in the complaint and engaging in false and misleading advertising regarding the digital television recorders 
we filed our answer to the complaint on october  discovery  through which we would seek to investigate the plaintiff s claims  has not commenced 
based on the information available  we are unable to form a conclusion regarding the amount  materiality or range of potential loss  if any  which might result if the outcome of this matter were unfavorable 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this action vigorously  however  we could be forced to incur material expenses in the litigation  and in the event there is an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
we expect to experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
since our initial public offering in september through march   our common stock has closed between per share and per share  closing at on march  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to  among other things  the factors discussed in this section and the following factors 
changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  
our failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  
release of new or enhanced products or introduction of new marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  
announcements by us or our competitors of the creation  developments under or termination of significant strategic partnerships  joint ventures  significant contracts or acquisitions  
fluctuations in the market prices generally for technology related stocks  
fluctuations in general economic conditions  
fluctuations in interest rates  
market conditions affecting the television and home entertainment industry  
fluctuations in operating results  and 
additions or departures of key personnel 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement and delaware law could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock 
we may become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents and our rights agreement could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a rights agreement 
each share of our common stock has attached to it a right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of our series b junior participating preferred stock at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share in the event that the rights become exercisable 
the rights become exercisable upon the earlier to occur of i ten days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock  subject to limited exceptions  or ii ten business days or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an acquiring person as described in the preceding clause following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of or more of our common stock  subject to limited exceptions 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our rights agreement could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the nature of some of our strategic relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we may engage in discussions with other parties concerning strategic relationships  which may include equity investments by such parties in our company 
we currently have such relationships with a number of our strategic partners  including aol  directv  sony and philips 
while we believe that such relationships have enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model  the terms and conditions of such relationships may place some restrictions on our freedom to operate in the future 
if the conversion price on the notes were reduced  it would result in dilution to the existing holders of our common stock 
the conversion price on the notes will be reduced on august  if the conversion price is greater than the average closing price per share of our common stock for the consecutive trading days preceding august  in addition  the conversion price on the notes may be reduced if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents at an issuance price or with respect to common stock equivalents  such additional common stock is issued with a conversion or exercise price per share less than the conversion price of the notes then in effect immediately prior to the issuance that is lower than the conversion price then in effect immediately prior to the issuance 
if the conversion price on the notes is reduced as a result of these adjustments  holders of the notes will receive a greater number of shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of the notes  thereby resulting in dilution to the existing holders of our common stock 
if shares of common stock are purchased in a transaction under the february common stock purchase agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd  described above in item under the heading liquidity and capital resources  existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution and  as a result  our stock price may go down 
we have entered into a common stock purchase agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
pursuant to which acqua wellington may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount between and  unless otherwise agreed to by us and acqua wellington 
as a result  our existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock by acqua wellington 
the purchase agreement with acqua wellington provides that  at our request  acqua wellington will purchase a certain dollar amount of shares  with the exact number of shares to be determined based on the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over the draw down period for such purchase 
as a result  if the per share market price of our common stock declines over the draw down period  acqua wellington will receive a greater number of shares for its purchase price  thereby resulting in further dilution to our stockholders and potential downward pressure on the price of our stock 
risks pertaining to arthur andersen our access to capital markets and timely financial reporting may be impaired if arthur andersen is unable to perform required audit related services 
on march   our independent public accountant  arthur andersen  was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron 
arthur andersen has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment 
the securities and exchange commission has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients 
our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely securities and exchange commission filings could be impaired if the securities and exchange commission ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the require representations to us or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform required audit related services for us 
as of the date hereof  our audit committee has not made any determination of which independent public accountant we will retain to perform our audit for the year ending january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and conduct transactions in us dollars 
our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with original maturities of less than one year 
we are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our results of operations or cash flows for our cash and cash equivalents and our short term investments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of january  for our cash and cash equivalents 
we had no short term investments at this time 
cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate 
in future quarters the price of our stock may reduce the conversion price on the convertible notes factors that may affect future operating results if the conversion price on the notes were reduced  it would result in dilution to the existing holders of our common stock 
in addition  a reduced conversion price on the convertible notes would increase the beneficial conversion calculation  thus increasing our interest expense 
although payments under the operating lease for our facility are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with the operating lease 
our capital lease obligations are not subject to changes in the interest rate and  therefore  are not exposed to interest rate risk
