on july   the board of directors of the company resolved to pursue the separation of its gaming and motorsports business segments into two publicly owned companies 
on march   dvd announced that the tax free spin off of dover downs  inc  its gaming business  is expected to be effective march  accordingly  the operations of this business have been reflected as a discontinued operation and excluded from consolidated revenues and expenses for all years in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and our discussions herein

the remainder of the revenue increase is primarily from adding a craftsman truck series event to the dover fall nascar weekend and the scheduling of the cart event at gateway international raceway in september compared with may the aforementioned increases in revenues were offset somewhat by the company s decision not to promote an irl event at dover international speedway during the six month period ended december   and the scheduling of the craftsman truck series event at gateway international raceway in may compared with september operating expenses increased by  principally due to the addition of a craftsman truck series event to the dover fall nascar weekend  the scheduling of the cart event at gateway international raceway in september compared with may and pre opening expenses attributable to nashville superspeedway

earnings from discontinued operation net of income taxes were  in the six month period ended december  as compared to  in the six month period ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to increased play in the casino and the reversal of a portion of prior accruals for disputed management fees related to our casino operations 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues increased by  or  to  approximately  of the revenue increase resulted from increased attendance and  from increased ticket prices for the nascar sanctioned events at dover international speedway 
the remainder of the increase was principally from increased broadcast rights fees  sponsorship  concessions and marketing related revenues at dover international speedway and the addition of a busch series event at memphis motorsports park in the second quarter of fiscal the aforementioned increases in revenues were offset somewhat by the rescheduling of the cart sanctioned event at gateway international raceway to september compared with may operating expenses increased by  principally due to a  increase in purse and sanction fee expenses at dover international speedway  and from the addition of a busch series event at memphis motorsports park in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by the rescheduling of the cart sanctioned event at gateway international raceway

earnings from continuing operations increased by  primarily due to higher attendance and related revenues as well as an increase in the broadcast rights fees for the nascar sanctioned motorsports events presented at dover international speedway and the addition of a busch series event at memphis motorsports park  offset by the rescheduling of the cart sanctioned event at gateway international raceway from may to september 
earnings from discontinued operation net of income taxes were  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase of  or  was primarily due to increased levels of play in the casino 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by continuing operations was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization expense from  in to  in  and the timing of certain construction payments related to the new nashville superspeedway and the timing of income tax payments 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the completion of the new nashville superspeedway project in april net cash provided by financing activities increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in as compared to was primarily due to additional borrowings under our revolving credit agreement primarily to fund construction costs related to the dover downs hotel and conference center which is being constructed by dover downs  inc the repayment of monies advanced to dover downs  inc is addressed below 
the company expects that its net cash flow from operating activities and funds available from its credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements in calendar  as well as any cash dividends the board of directors may decide to declare 
at december   the company had two credit facilities with a total capacity of  amounts outstanding at december  were  and after consideration of standby letters of credit outstanding  the amount available pursuant to the two facilities was approximately  the  credit facility expires on june  and the  credit facility expires on september  the company has signed a new  credit facility expected to expire on december   but the effectiveness of that agreement is contingent upon the completion of the tax free spin off of the company s gaming operations  and as a result  the amounts outstanding under the company s  facilities at december  have been classified as short term 
the new credit facility contains minimum net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage covenant requirements that the company must comply with in order to avoid the requirement for early payment of the credit facility 
material adverse changes in the company s results of operations would impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
dvd s existing  credit facilities are guaranteed by dover downs  inc and all of its other subsidiaries 
the new  credit facility does not include dover downs  inc as it will be spun off 
prior to the new facility becoming effective  million of the amount outstanding under the existing dvd credit facilities will be paid down through a new million credit facility which has been established by gaming entertainment 
additionally  at december  gaming entertainment owed dvd million primarily representing the payment of certain costs by dover downs for gaming entertainment and borrowings under dover downs credit facility maintained for the benefit of dover downs and all of its subsidiaries 
dover downs and gaming entertainment have agreed to cancel any remaining intercompany balances and adjust dover downs stockholders equity by an equal amount at the date of the spin off 
as such  the intercompany balance is reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
related party transactions during the year ended december   the six month period ended december  and the years ended june  and  the company purchased certain paving  site work and construction services involving total payments of    and  from a company wholly owned by an employee director 
during the six month period ended december   the company purchased an aircraft from a company wholly owned by the aforementioned employee director for  the company purchased administrative services from rollins truck leasing corp 
and affiliated companies rtlc  which were related to the company through common ownership  during the year ended december   the six month period ended december  and the years ended june  and the total cost of these services  which have been included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings  was    and  respectively 
gaming entertainment purchased administrative services from rtlc during the year ended december   the six month period ended december  and the years ended june  and the total cost of these services  which have been included in earnings from discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of earnings  was    and  respectively 
rtlc ceased to provide these services effective in april during the year ended december   the six months ended december  and the years ended june  and  gaming entertainment allocated corporate costs of    and  respectively  to dover downs 
the allocation was based on both an allocation to the business that directly incurred the costs and an analysis of each company s share of the costs 
the net costs incurred by each company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the companies had been separate  independent entities and had otherwise managed these functions  however  management believes that these costs are reasonable 
subsequent to the spin off  use of gaming entertainment s mile harness racing track will be under an easement granted by dover downs which does not require the payment of any rent 
under the terms of the easement gaming entertainment has exclusive use of the harness track during the period beginning november of each year and ending april of the following year  together with set up and tear down rights for the two weeks before and after such period 
the harness track is located on property owned by dover downs and is on the inside of dover downs motorsports superspeedway 
the indoor grandstands will be used by the company free of charge in connection with its motorsports events and are owned by gaming entertainment 
dover downs also leases its principal executive office space from gaming entertainment 
various easements and agreements relative to access  utilities and parking have also been entered into between the company and gaming entertainment 
the transition support services agreement provides for each of dover downs and gaming entertainment to provide each other with certain administrative and operational services subsequent to the spin off 
the tax sharing agreement provides for  among other things  the treatment of income tax matters for periods beginning before and including the date of the spin off and any taxes resulting from transactions effected in connection with the spin off 
at the date of the acquisition of grand prix association of long beach   was due to grand prix from certain shareholders officers for outstanding loans made for the purpose of purchasing grand prix common stock 
as of december    was outstanding from a current director of the company 
this remaining balance was repaid in full in january contractual obligations the company has issued a standby letter of credit to guarantee variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  issued by the sports authority of wilson  tennessee in the amount of  the proceeds from the bonds were used to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements in wilson county  tennessee 
interest only payments are required until september   and will be made from a capitalized interest fund established from the bond proceeds 
the principal payments range from  in september to  in when the capitalized interest fund is depleted  which is estimated to be in or around july of  the debt service on the bonds will be payable solely from sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
if the taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments will be made pursuant to the aforementioned letter of credit 
the company believes that the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will satisfy the debt service requirements of the bonds 
however  if the debt service is not satisfied from the aforementioned sources  the bonds would become a liability of the company 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit which secures the bonds or we allow an uncured default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
the company has entered into several sanctioning agreements to conduct motorsports events at its various venues 
the company has held nascar sanctioned events for consecutive years and its subsidiary  grand prix association of long beach  has operated the grand prix of long beach for consecutive years 
nonrenewal of a nascar event license or the cart agreement for the long beach event would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at december   the company had two credit facilities with a total capacity of  interest is based  at the company s option  upon i libor plus 
or ii the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
minus 
the  credit facility expires on june  and the  credit facility expires on september  the agreements are for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements and other general corporate purposes 
at december   the company was in compliance with all terms of the facilities and there was  outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
under the terms of the credit facilities  approximately  of additional borrowings were available to the company at december  a subsidiary of the company entered into an agreement the swida loan with southwestern illinois development authority swida to receive the proceeds from the taxable sports facility revenue bonds  series gateway international motorsports corporation project  a municipal bond offering  in the aggregate principal amount of  the offering of the bonds closed on june  the repayment terms and debt service reserve requirements of the bonds issued in the municipal bond offering correspond to the terms of the swida loan 
swida loaned all of the proceeds from the municipal bond offering to the company s subsidiary for the purpose of the redevelopment  construction and expansion of gateway international raceway  and the proceeds of the swida loan were irrevocably committed to complete construction of gateway international raceway  to fund interest  to create a debt service reserve fund and to pay for the cost of issuance of the bonds 
the company has established certain restricted cash funds to meet debt service as required by the swida loan  which are held by the trustee bny trust company of missouri 
at december    of the company s cash balance is restricted by the swida loan 
a standby letter of credit for  which is secured by a trust deed on the company s facilities in memphis  tennessee  also was obtained to satisfy debt service reserve fund obligations 
the swida loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on all the real property owned and a security interest in all property leased by the company s subsidiary at gateway international raceway 
the swida loan bears interest at varying rates ranging from to with an effective rate of approximately 
the structure of the bonds permits amortization from february through february with debt service beginning in following interest only payments from february through august in addition  a portion of the property taxes to be paid by the company if any to the city of madison tax incremental fund have been pledged to the annual retirement of debt and payment of interest 
the scheduled maturities of long term debt outstanding at december  are as follows      and thereafter  critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
goodwill the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective in  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by the company s pension plans are based on years of service and employee s renumeration over their employment with the company 
the company establishes accrued pension costs in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that the company records in its consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  the company adopted the provisions of this statement during  and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement the company has elected to adopt the provisions of statement effective january   at which time the company will cease to record amortization expense on its goodwill 
the adoption of statement will result in a  reduction of amortization expense in we expect to complete our analysis of any potential impairment of our goodwill as a result of adopting this standard by the end of the second quarter of in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of statement no 
in to accomplish this  we must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact of adoption of this standard 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while statement no 
supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
statement no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
we adopted the provisions of statement no 
effective january  the adoption of statement no 
did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable  or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given  or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors our growth strategies  our development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  our ability to enter into additional contracts with sponsors  broadcast media and race event sanctioning bodies  our relationships with sponsors  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  our ability to finance future business requirements  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state  and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the affect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military actions  air travel  national or local catastrophic events  as well as the risks  uncertainties and other factors described from time to time in our sec filings and reports 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
our relationship with sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon keeping a good working relationship with the governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events 
these governing bodies include nascar  cart  irl and nhra 
the governing bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  either expressly or by implication  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
moreover  no existing sanction agreement  unless expressly provided for in the agreement  can be construed to require the sanctioning body to enter into a sanction agreement or to issue a sanction for any other event in the future 
our inability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to maintain sanction agreements at current levels would likely result in lower than anticipated revenues from admissions  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions  and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a substantial portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events  our permanent venues  official product sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased government regulation of sponsors and restrictions on advertising could substantially reduce our advertising revenue we receive a significant portion of our revenue from sponsorship and advertising by various companies 
tobacco and liquor companies have traditionally sponsored motorsports events 
in june  major tobacco companies entered into an agreement with federal negotiators and various states attorneys general whereby the tobacco companies agreed to give up certain advertising and promotional activity in exchange for liability limits in pending and future lawsuits 
new laws or settlements could have a material adverse effect on the tobacco and liquor industry motorsports sponsorship and advertising expenditures 
government regulations and restrictions on advertising by tobacco companies  liquor companies and other potential sponsors could adversely impact revenues as well as the revenues of the motorsports industry as a whole 
while we believe that the popularity of motorsports would allow us to secure alternate sponsors  there is no assurance that alternate sponsors could be obtained 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 
our street races depend on city permits and good relationships with city officials in order to conduct the grand prix of long beach  we must obtain an annual permit from the city of long beach to hold the race on city streets 
although grand prix has operated a racing event on the streets of long beach for twenty seven years  there can be no assurance that this event will continue to be held or be successful 
similarly  the grand prix events we have planned for denver  colorado and st 
petersburg  florida require that we obtain a variety of licenses and permits 
our ability to conduct street races requires that we maintain excellent relationships with the host city and its officials 
grand prix s ability to meet payment obligations under a loan agreement with an illinois government agency depends on revenues from gateway in order to finance the redevelopment of gateway international raceway  grand prix entered into a loan agreement with the southwest illinois development authority  which agreed to fund a loan to grand prix by issuing municipal bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by grand prix 
grand prix issued a year  promissory note to swida which bears interest at an effective rate of approximately per annum 
payments on the swida loan are intended to be made primarily from the revenues from the operations of gateway 
although grand prix is current on its obligation and expects to meet its future debt payment obligations out of the revenues from gateway  and although grand prix will receive certain assistance from the city of madison  illinois in the form of a tax increment finance fund which should assist it in meeting its debt burdens  there can be no assurance that earnings from the future operations of gateway will be sufficient to meet grand prix s debt service obligations 
a default under the swida loan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of wilson county  tennessee issued  in revenue bonds to build local infrastructure improvements which will benefit the operation of the new nashville superspeedway complex 
interest only payments are required until september  and will be made from a capitalized interest fund established from bond proceeds 
when the capitalized interest fund is depleted  which is estimated to be in or around july of  the debt service on the bonds will be payable solely from sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
in the event the taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments will be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by several banks pursuant to a reimbursement and security agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse the banks for drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to five nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in may and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are non refundable  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales  concessions and souvenirs  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the carrying values of dvd s long term debt approximates its fair value at december  and dvd is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for its variable rate borrowings of  at december  under its revolving credit facilities 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the balance outstanding at december  would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson  tennessee issued its variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  in the amount of  the proceeds were used to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements in wilson county  tennessee  which will be beneficial to the operation of the superspeedway complex the company constructed through its wholly owned subsidiary  nashville speedway  usa 
interest only payments are required until september  and will be made from a capitalized interest fund established from bond proceeds 
when the capitalized interest fund is depleted  which is estimated to be in or around july of  the debt service on the bonds will be payable solely from sales and incremental property taxes the taxes generated from the facility 
if the taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments will be made under a  letter of credit issued on behalf of the company by several banks
