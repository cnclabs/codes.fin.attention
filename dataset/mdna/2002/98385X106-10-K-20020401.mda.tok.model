item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  general product prices 
federal and state regulations there have been  and continue to be  numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect the company 
the company cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january   and none of the company s gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
the company cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the company s properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing the company s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of the company s oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
these rules have had little effect on the company s oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled 
the company may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering similar regulations 
new regulations have not had a material effect on the operations of the company s gathering systems  but the company cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on its gathering systems 
federal  state or native american leases the company s operations on federal  state or native american oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact the company s operations and costs 
management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  the company has not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company

item legal proceedings a class action lawsuit  styled booth  et al 
v 
cross timbers oil company  was filed against the company in the district court of dewey county  oklahoma in april the action was filed on behalf of all persons who  at any time since june  have been paid royalties on gas produced from any gas well within the state of oklahoma under which the company has assumed the obligation to pay royalties 
the plaintiffs allege that the company has reduced royalty payments by post production deductions and has entered into contracts with subsidiaries that were not arm s length transactions 
the plaintiffs further allege that these actions reduced the royalties paid to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated  and that such actions are a breach of the leases under which the royalties are paid 
these deductions allegedly include production and post production costs  marketing costs  administration costs and costs incurred by the company in gathering  compressing  dehydrating  processing  treating  blending and or transporting the gas produced 
the company contends that  to the extent any fees are proportionately borne by the plaintiffs  these fees are established by arm s length negotiations with third parties or  if charged by affiliates  are comparable to fees charged by third party gatherers or processors 
the company further contends that any such fees enhance the value of the gas or the products derived from the gas 
the plaintiffs are seeking an accounting and payment of the monies allegedly owed to them 
a hearing on the class certification issue has not been scheduled

s 
district court for the western district of oklahoma against the company and certain of its subsidiaries by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act 
the plaintiff alleges that the company underpaid royalties on gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans by at least during the past years as a result of mismeasuring the volume of gas and incorrectly analyzing its heating content 
the plaintiff has made similar allegations in over actions filed against more than other companies 
the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of royalties not paid  together with treble damages  a civil penalty of  to  for each violation and attorney fees and expenses 
the plaintiff also seeks an order for the company to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices

in february  the department of interior notified the company and several other producers that certain native american leases located in the san juan basin have expired due to the failure of the leases to produce in paying quantities from february through august the department of interior has demanded abandonment of the property as well as payment of the gross proceeds from the wells minus royalties paid from the date of the alleged cessation of production to present 
the company has filed a notice of appeal with the interior board of indian appeals 
management believes it has strong defenses against this claim and intends to vigorously defend the action 
management s estimate of the potential liability from this claim has been accrued in the company s financial statements 
in june  the company was served with a lawsuit styled quinque operating co  et al 
v 
gas pipelines  et al 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against the company and one of its subsidiaries  along with over natural gas transmission companies  producers  gatherers and processors of natural gas 
plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas working interest owners  overriding royalty owners and royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or who received economic benefit from the sale of such gas since january  no class has been certified 
the allegations in the case are similar to those in the grynberg case  however  the quinque case broadens the claims to cover all oil and gas leases other than the federal and native american leases that are the subject of the grynberg case 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have mismeasured both the volume and heating content of natural gas delivered into their pipelines resulting in underpayments to the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs assert a breach of contract claim  negligent or intentional misrepresentation  civil conspiracy  common carrier liability  conversion  violation of a variety of kansas statutes and other common law causes of action 
the amount of damages was not specified in the complaint 
in september  the company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit  which is currently pending

hedging activities reduced gas revenue by million in and by million in  and reduced oil revenue by million in and by million in cumulative effect of accounting change for derivatives 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
by recording a one time after tax charge of million in the income statement for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and an unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is an element of stockholders equity 
the unrealized loss was related to the derivative fair value of cash flow hedges 
the charge to the income statement was primarily related to the company s gas physical delivery contract at crude oil based prices 
derivative fair value gain loss 
the company has recorded realized derivative gains and losses in its income statements and unrealized derivative gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company recorded a million gain in and a million loss in related to changes in fair value of non hedge derivatives 
the loss and million of the gain are related to the change in fair value of call options that the company sold in as part of its hedging activities 
because written call options do not provide protection against declining prices  they do not qualify for hedge or loss deferral accounting 
most of the remaining gain in is related to the change in fair value of a gas physical delivery contract with crude oil based pricing  the loss on which was initially recorded in the cumulative effect of accounting change for derivatives 
at december   the company has recorded a net unrealized gain of million net of million tax in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
the ultimate settlement value of these hedges will be recognized in the income statement as gas revenue when the related production occurs through the company also has fixed price gas physical delivery contracts that are not expected to be net cash settled  and therefore  their fair value of million is not recorded in the financial statements 
revenues from these contracts will be recognized as the commodity is delivered 
enron corporation bankruptcy 
as of december   the date of its bankruptcy filing  enron corporation was the counterparty to some of the company s hedge derivative contracts  as well as purchaser of natural gas under certain physical delivery contracts 
one of these contracts was a natural gas physical delivery contract with crude oil based pricing  also referred to as the enron btu swap contract 
the company terminated its contracts with enron and has recorded a net receivable of million related to gas physical deliveries and hedge derivative fair value at the contract termination dates 
an additional million is due from enron for net unrealized gains related to undelivered gas under physical delivery contracts  which has not been recorded in the company s financial statements 
in accordance with termination provisions of the enron btu swap contract  the company believes that it no longer has a liability to enron under this contract 
however  until this debt is legally extinguished  the million fair value liability of this contract at the date of termination must remain recorded in the company s financial statements 
in the event the termination provisions of the enron btu swap contract are ultimately not enforced  the company believes that it should have the right to offset all amounts due from enron  including amounts related to undelivered gas under physical delivery contracts  against any enron btu swap contract liability 
because this liability exceeds net receivables from enron  no reserve for asset collectibility is anticipated to be necessary 
the final resolution of the enron bankruptcy and related proceedings may result in a settlement materially different from amounts recorded at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
incentive compensation 
incentive compensation results from stock appreciation right  performance share and royalty trust option awards  and subsequent changes in the company s stock price 
incentive compensation totaled million in and million in  which was primarily related to performance share grants  as well as royalty trust option exercises in incentive compensation was not significant in as of december   there were  performance shares outstanding that vest when the common stock price reaches   performance shares outstanding that vest when the common stock price reaches and  performance shares that vest in increments of  in each of and in february  upon vesting of the performance shares with the common stock vesting price  an additional  performance shares were issued that vested when the stock price reached in march product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other conditions the company generally cannot control or predict 
oil 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
after opec members and other oil producers agreed to production cuts in march  oil prices climbed through the remainder of and first quarter despite opec production increases in  increased demand sustained higher prices 
the west texas intermediate wti posted price reached per bbl in september  its highest level in ten years 
lagging demand in  attributable to a worldwide economic slowdown  caused oil prices to decline 
opec members agreed to cut daily production by one million barrels in april and an additional one million barrels in september to adjust for weak demand and excess supply 
the economic decline was accelerated by the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   placing further downward pressure on oil prices 
in december  opec announced additional production cuts of million barrels per day effective january   for six months 
the company uses commodity price hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to oil price fluctuations 
excluding the effect of these hedging instruments  the company s average oil price was in and in the company did not hedge oil prices in and its average oil price was 
with economic recoveries in the us and global markets  oil prices have strengthened during at march   the average nymex oil price for the following months was per bbl 
the company estimates that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
gas 
natural gas prices are dependent upon north american supply and demand  which is affected by weather conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
the average price was lower because of high levels of gas remaining in storage from the abnormally warm winter of gas prices began to increase in may and  after declining briefly at year end  strengthened in  reaching a record high of per mmbtu in december as winter demand strained gas supplies 
gas prices declined during because of fuel switching due to higher prices  milder weather and a weaker economy  which has reduced the demand for gas to generate electricity and resulted in sharply increased gas storage levels 
despite the winter of being one of the warmest on record and the likely result that storage levels will be higher than historical averages at the end of the heating season  gas prices have increased during and are expected to remain volatile 
at march   the average nymex gas price for the following months was per mmbtu 
the company uses commodity price hedging instruments  including fixed price delivery contracts  to reduce its exposure to gas price fluctuations 
excluding the effect of these hedging instruments  the company s average gas price was in  in and in the company has hedges in place on approximately of april through december projected production  including futures and fixed price contracts with an average weighted nymex price of for of production  and collars that provide an average weighted nymex floor price of and ceiling price of for of production 
including the effects of gains on closed futures contracts  these collars provide a floor price of and a ceiling price of 
after the effects of hedging  the company estimates that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in a million change in annual operating cash flow  subject to floor and ceiling prices provided by the collars 
the following summarizes the company s april through december gas hedging positions at march   as are further detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements

impairment provision 
the company regularly determines whether an impairment provision is needed for producing properties based on an assessment of recoverability of net property costs from estimated future net cash flows from those properties 
estimated future net cash flows are based on management s best estimate of projected oil and gas reserves and prices 
the company has not recorded impairment of producing properties since a million provision was recorded in if oil and gas prices significantly decline  the company may be required to record impairment provisions for producing properties in the future  which could be material

taxes  transportation and other per mcfe increased from to because of increased prices and other deductions 
dd a increased million  or  primarily because of the acquisitions and the and development programs 
on an mcfe basis  dd a increased slightly from in to 
general and administrative expense increased million  or because of incentive compensation of million and increased expenses from company growth related to the acquisitions 
excluding incentive compensation  general and administrative expense per mcfe increased from in to in interest expense increased million  or  primarily because of a increase in weighted average borrowings and an increase in the weighted average interest rate 
interest classified as part of the gain loss on investment in equity securities decreased million from interest expense per mcfe increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings against the revolving credit facility  occasional producing property sales including sales of royalty trust units and public offerings of equity and debt 
other than for operations  the company s cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to fund its cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in increased operating cash flow during this three year period was primarily because of increased prices and production from acquisitions and development activity 
before changes in operating assets and liabilities and exploration expense  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in operating cash flow is largely dependent upon the prices received for oil and gas production 
the company has hedged approximately of its projected april through december gas production  including futures and fixed price contracts that hedge of production and collars that hedge of production 
see product prices under general above 
the company does not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect its liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of company growth related to acquisitions and development 
as of december   total capitalization was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was billion of which was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is primarily because of increased earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income which is related to the unrealized fair value gain on hedge derivatives 
working capital the company generally maintains low cash and cash equivalent balances because it uses available funds to reduce bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since the company s principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  the company often has low or negative working capital 
the increase from negative working capital of million at december  to working capital of million at december  was primarily attributable to the derivative fair value asset  net of deferred income taxes  recorded during related to adoption of sfas no 
 the new derivative accounting principle 
financing on december   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with commercial banks were million with unused borrowing capacity of million 
the interest rate of at december  is based on the one month london interbank offered rate plus 
based on the value of the company s reserves  the borrowing base increased to billion effective june  the bank s total commitment  however  remains at million  resulting in no increase to the company s borrowing capacity 
the borrowing base is redetermined annually based on the value and expected cash flow of the company s proved oil and gas reserves 
if borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base  the banks may require that the excess be repaid within a year 
based on reserve values at december  and using parameters specified by the banks  the borrowing base remains in excess of the million commitment 
borrowings under the loan agreement are due may   but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the company may renegotiate the loan agreement to increase borrowing capacity and extend the revolving facility 
in february  the loan agreement was amended to allow the repurchase of the company s subordinated debt and to increase commodity hedging limits 
in may  the loan agreement was amended to allow the company to issue senior debt 
the acquisitions were partially funded by the sale and issuance of common stock  cash flow from operations and contributions from lehman  the company s equity partner until it later purchased lehman s interest in these acquisitions 
these transactions are described under general above 
see also capital expenditures below 
in october  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to potentially offer securities which could include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants to purchase debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
the total price of securities to be offered is million  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
net proceeds from the sale of such securities are to be used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of bank debt 
as of march  no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
capital expenditures in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled million compared with million in the company has budgeted million for the development and exploration program 
as it has done historically  the company expects to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  the company has the flexibility to adjust its actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of the company s acquisition and development programs 
because of their size  the acquisitions were made jointly with lehman as a equity partner 
the company acquired lehman s interest in the spring holding acquisition in september the company purchased lehman s interest in the ocean energy acquisition in march for million  funded primarily by the proceeds from sales of property and equity security investments 
the company plans to fund any future property acquisitions through a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales  bank debt  public equity or debt transactions 
there are no restrictions under the company s revolving credit agreement that would affect the company s ability to use its remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of a total of million shares of the company s common stock 
during  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at a cost of million  including million shares repurchased under a board authorization 
no shares were repurchased in as of march   million shares are available for repurchase 
to date  the company has not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and it does not expect to do so during however  new regulations  enforcement policies  claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share from through second quarter  per common share for third quarter through first quarter and per common share for the remainder of the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon available cash flow  as well as other factors 
in addition  the company s bank loan agreement restricts the amount of common stock dividends and treasury stock repurchases to of cash flow from operations  as defined  for the last four quarters 
contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes the company s significant obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december  the company has not guaranteed the debt of any other party  nor does the company have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt 
long term debt 
borrowings under the company s senior bank revolving credit facility were million at december  bank debt is not due until may  but may be prepaid at any date 
the company may renegotiate its bank debt to increase borrowing capacity and extend its maturity 
subordinated debt totaled million at december  of that amount  million is due in april and million is due in november subordinated debt may be redeemed at a price of approximately in for further information regarding long term debt  see note to consolidated financial statements 
operating leases 
the company s minimum lease payment commitments under noncancelable lease agreements totaled million at december  estimated annual payments under these lease agreements for the next five years are disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
estimated annual payments total million for and decline for subsequent years 
drilling contracts 
the company has minimum drilling rig use payments of million in and million in these costs are part of the company s budgeted capital expenditures of million for derivative hedge contracts 
the company has entered into futures contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
because the contractual fixed price generally exceeds the current market gas price  the company expects to receive payments from counterparties under most of these contracts 
if market gas prices increase  the company could be required to make payments under these contracts  which would be funded by the higher price received from the sale of company gas production 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
for further information regarding commitments  see note to consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions the company has limited related party transactions  as further disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
during and  the company loaned five of its officers million pursuant to full recourse promissory notes to pay margin debt in broker accounts in which the officers held company common stock 
in may  officers sold  shares of common stock to the company for million and used the proceeds to partially repay their loans 
these loans were fully repaid in the interest rate charged on these loans was equal to the company s bank debt rate 
a company  partially owned by one of the company s directors  performs acquisition and divestiture consulting for the company 
this director related company received consulting fees of  in it also represented the purchaser of properties sold by the company during  and also invested in the purchase 
this director related company also performed consulting services in connection with a producing property acquisition and was entitled to receive  at its election  either a working interest or a overriding royalty interest conveyed from the company s working interest in the properties after payout of acquisition and operating costs 
the company acquired this potential interest from the director related company and other parties in for a price of million  pursuant to an independent fairness opinion 
the director related company received million of the purchase price 
critical accounting policies the company s financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by accounting policies and estimates related to its oil and gas properties  proved reserves  and commodity prices and risk management  as summarized below 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
the company  which generally pursues acquisition and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities  follows the successful efforts method of accounting 
property costs must be expensed through an impairment provision if in excess of the estimated future cash flows of proved reserves 
the company evaluates possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that they may be impaired 
cash flow pricing estimates are based on existing proved reserve and production information and pricing assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
individually significant undeveloped properties are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis  and impairment of other undeveloped properties is done on a total basis 
the company s impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision recorded in by comparison  full cost companies must generally record higher impairment provisions under a ceiling test which is computed using discounted estimated future after tax cash flows based on current market prices 
oil and gas reserves the company s proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from original estimates 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
if estimated proved reserves decline  future dd a expense will increase and net income will be reduced 
a decline in proved reserves also can result in a required impairment provision  as discussed under oil and gas property accounting above 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in note to consolidated financial statements  are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
commodity prices and risk management commodity prices significantly affect the company s operating results  financial condition  cash flows and ability to borrow funds 
current market oil and gas prices are affected by supply and demand as well as seasonal  political and other conditions which the company generally cannot control 
oil and gas prices and markets are expected to continue their historical volatility 
see general product prices above 
the company attempts to reduce its price risk by entering into financial instruments such as gas futures contracts  collars and swap agreements  as well as fixed priced physical delivery contracts 
while these instruments guarantee a certain price and  therefore  a certain cash flow  there is the risk that the company will not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices 
these contracts also expose the company to credit risk of non performance by the contract counterparties  which the company attempts to limit by obtaining letters of credit or other appropriate security 
the company also has sold call options as part of its hedging program 
call options  however  do not provide a hedge against declining prices and there is the risk that the call sales proceeds will be less than the benefit a higher sales price would have provided 
during  the company s commodity price hedging activities resulted in a per mcf increase in the average gas price 
during  the company s commodity price hedging activities resulted in a per mcf reduction in the average gas price and a per bbl reduction in the average oil price 
based on cash flow hedges and physical delivery contracts in place at march   the company estimates that it has hedged approximately of its april through december projected production  including futures and fixed price contracts that hedge of production  and collars that hedge of production 
while the company s price risk management activities decrease the volatility of cash flows  they may obscure the company s operating results and financial condition 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  the company adopted sfas no 
on january  with a significant charge to its income statement and equity related to recording derivative financial instruments at their market value 
subsequent to that date  the company recorded significant derivative fair value gains in the income statement and equity related to decline in natural gas prices 
during  the company recorded a significant loss related to the fair value of call options 
in each instance  these are projected gains and losses that will be realized upon settlement of these contracts in future periods when related production occurs 
these gains and losses are offset by increases and decreases in the market value of the company s proved reserves  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
also  a significant portion of the company s gas price hedging is provided by fixed price physical delivery contracts which had a fair value of million at december  this asset is not recorded in the company s financial statements since the contracts are deemed to be normal sales that are not expected to be net cash settled  and therefore are not derivatives 
derivatives that provide effective cash flow hedges are designated as hedges and the company defers related fair value gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs 
because hedge accounting is not required under generally accepted accounting principles  the company s operating results as reflected in its financial statements may not be comparable to other companies 
see item a  commodity price risk for the effect of price changes on derivative fair value gains and losses 
accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board issued the following statements of financial accounting standards 
sfas no 
 business combinations  requires the use of the purchase method of accounting  as opposed to the pooling of interests method  for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  it supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
the adoption of sfas no 
should have no material affect on the company s financial statements since it has historically used the purchase method of accounting to record business combinations 

sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  changes the method of accounting for acquired goodwill and other tangible assets  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized and will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied to fiscal years beginning after december  and should not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 

sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  amends sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the cost of the long lived asset 
the statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  the effect of the company s adoption of sfas no 
has not been determined but is currently not expected to be material 

sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
with this pronouncement  the fasb establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including the reporting of discontinued operations 
the statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of the company s adoption of sfas no 
has not been determined but is currently not expected to be material 
production imbalances the company has gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred for gas deliveries in excess of the company s net revenue interest  while revenue is accrued for the undelivered volumes 
production imbalances are generally recorded at the estimated sales price in effect at the time of production 
the consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts related to production imbalances december in thousands amount mcf amount mcf accounts receivable current underproduction     accounts payable current overproduction     net current gas underproduction balancing receivable 
 other assets noncurrent underproduction     other long term liability noncurrent overproduction     net long term gas overproduction balancing payable     other assets noncurrent carbon dioxide underproduction     net long term overproduction balancing payable   forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by the company  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to the company s operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may be or may concern  among other things  capital expenditures  cash flow  drilling activity  acquisition and development activities  pricing differentials  operating costs  production activities  oil  gas and natural gas liquids reserves and prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  liquidity  debt repayment  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  predicts  anticipates  believes  estimates  goal  should  could  assume  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are 
crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations  
changes in interest rates  
the company s ability to acquire oil and gas properties that meet its objectives and to identify prospects for drilling  
higher than expected production costs and other expenses  
potential delays or failure to achieve expected production from existing and future exploration and development projects  
volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and related financial derivatives  
basis risk and counterparty credit risk in executing commodity price risk management activities  
potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  and 
competition in the oil and gas industry as well as competition from other sources of energy 
in addition  these forward looking statements may be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company only enters derivative financial instruments in conjunction with its hedging activities 
these instruments principally include interest rate swap agreements and commodity futures  collars  swaps and option agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of fluctuations in interest rates and natural gas and crude oil prices 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
the board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by the company relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the chairman or the executive vice president administration of all risk management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   the company s variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value  and the company s fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
the company attempts to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate subordinated debt  as well as the use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and interest rate swaps  and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
hypothetical carrying fair change in in thousands amount value fair value december  long term debt    a interest rate swaps   a december  long term debt    interest rate swaps   a this is approximate gain in fair value of long term debt and loss in fair value of interest rate swaps from a basis point increase in interest rates 
because of the limitation in value caused by the call price of the company s fixed rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would not significantly affect fair value at december  commodity price risk the company hedges a portion of its price risks associated with its crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   the company had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
these contracts and agreements had a net fair value gain of approximately million at december  and a net fair value loss of million at december  of the december  fair value  a million gain has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts and an  loss has been determined based on the broker bid and ask quotes for basis contracts 
these fair values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparties 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements at december  this sensitivity does not include physical product delivery contracts  which are not expected to be settled in cash or another financial instrument  these contracts had a fair value gain of million at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
because these futures contracts and swap agreements are designated hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to product revenues in the consolidated income statement 
in conjunction with its hedging activities  the company sold call options to sell future gas production at certain ceiling prices 
call options outstanding had a fair value loss of million at december  all call options were settled in with payments to the counterparties totaling million  resulting in a derivative fair value gain of million 
the company had a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract was priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it was accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument under sfas no 
beginning january  this contract referred to as the enron btu swap contract was terminated in december in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation  and as a result  the company believes that its liability under this contract was reduced to zero 
a million current liability will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet until this contractual liability is legally extinguished 
see note to consolidated financial statements and general enron corporation bankruptcy above 
in november  the company entered derivative contracts to effectively defer until and any cash flow impact related to  mcf of daily gas deliveries in that were to be made under the enron btu swap contract 
the net fair value loss on these contracts at december  was million 
of this fair value  a million gain has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts and a million loss has been based on company estimated oil prices for periods beyond for which there are not readily available exchange trade values 
these values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparty 
the effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately  in the fair value of these contracts  while a change in crude oil prices would result in a change of approximately  in march  the company terminated contracts with maturities of may through december and received million from the counterparty 
because these contracts are non hedge derivatives  most of the related million gain related to their termination was recorded in derivative fair value gain
