certain reclassifications have been made to our prior years results to conform to presentations 
such reclassifications had no effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies marketable and non marketable warrant  equity and venture capital fund investment securities marketable warrant  equity and venture capital fund investment securities are classified as available for sale and are accounted for at fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on marketable warrant securities  venture capital fund investments or equity investments are recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying security 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  after applicable taxes  are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  until realized 
we are typically contractually precluded from taking steps to secure the current unrealized gains associated with many of these equity instruments 
hence  the amount of income we realize from these equity instruments in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
we record non marketable warrant securities  venture capital fund investments and other private equity investments  on a cost basis less any identified impairment 
the asset value of non marketable equity securities is reduced when declines in value are considered to be other than temporary 
any estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income as a loss from equity securities along with income recognized on similar assets  if any 
venture capital fund limited partner investment interests are reported under the cost method as our interests are considered minor  in that we own less than  and have no influence over the related venture capital fund s operating and financial policies 
our cost in these venture capital fund investments is reduced by distributions until fully recovered 
distributions in excess of the venture capital fund limited partner investment cost are recognized as investment gains in noninterest income 
investments held by silicon valley bancventures  lp are recorded using investment accounting rules and consist of stock in private companies that are not traded in a public market and are subject to restrictions on resale 
these investments are carried at estimated fair value determined by the general partner after giving consideration to operating results  financial conditions  recent sales  prices of issuers securities and other pertinent information 
the general partner  silicon valley bancventures  inc is controlled by silicon valley bancshares 
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses on our consolidated statements of income 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  however  those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
silicon valley bancventures  lp may also have risk associated with its concentration of investments in certain geographic areas and certain industries 
the investments in limited partnerships  held by svb strategic investors fund  lp  are recorded using investment accounting rules  calculated as the percentage of its interest in the total fair market value of the partnerships 
these partnerships are venture capital partnerships that hold investments in publicly traded securities 
these stocks may be subject to selling restrictions and limitations or held in escrow 
these stocks were valued by the general partners of these partnerships and may be discounted from market prices 
these venture capital partnerships also hold investments which are not currently traded in a public market and are subject to restrictions on resale 
these investments are carried by the venture capital partnerships at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner after giving consideration to operating results  financial conditions  recent sales  prices of issuers securities  and other pertinent information 
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses on our consolidated statements of income 
the general partner of svb strategic investors fund  lp  svb strategic investors  llc is controlled by silicon valley bancshares 
svb strategic investors  llc generally utilizes the valuations assigned to the venture capital fund investments by their general partners 
because of the uncertainty of valuations  however  these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
the partnerships may also have risk associated with its concentration of investments in certain geographic areas and certain industries 
we consider our marketable and non marketable warrant  equity and venture capital fund investment securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of income  if any  from these instruments  typically depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
therefore  we cannot predict future gains with any degree of accuracy and any gains are likely to vary materially from period to period 
in addition  our investments in marketable or non marketable venture capital funds and equity investment securities could lose value or become worthless which would reduce our net income or could cause a net loss in any period 
for example  in we wrote down the gross value of our venture capital fund and equity investment securities  excluding the impact of minority interest owned investments  by million 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize gains from marketable warrant securities in future periods  or our realized gains may be materially less than the current level of unrealized gains disclosed in this filing  due to changes in investor demand for initial public offerings and fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
allowance for loan losses we define credit risk as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  our management seeks to reduce such credit risks 
while we follow underwriting and credit monitoring procedures which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  our potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated financial position and earnings 
we consider our accounting policies related to our allowance for loan losses to be critical as it involves material estimates by our management and is particularly susceptible to possible change in the near term 
the process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise 
an estimate of possible changes or range of possible changes cannot be made 
our management applies the following evaluation process to our loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan losses 
we maintain a systematic process to evaluate individual loans for inherent risk of loan losses 
the process segregates risk of loan losses  primarily through an internal risk rating methodology 
this evaluation includes  but is not limited to  such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
our policies require that certain credit relationships  exceeding specific dollar values  be reviewed by a committee of senior management  at least quarterly 
our review process evaluates the appropriateness of the risk rating and allocation of allowance for loan losses  as well as other account management functions 
in addition  our management receives and approves an analysis for all impaired loans  as defined by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated based on a formula allocation for similarly risk rated loans  or for specific risk issues  which suggest a probable loss factor exceeding the formula allocation for a specific loan  or for individual impaired loans as determined by sfas no 
at our management s discretion judgmental allowance for loan losses may be established for loss expectations for specific lending industry sectors  for national or international economic conditions affecting the loan portfolio  or for policy or personnel changes 
the judgmental allowance is not assigned to individual loans and may fluctuate period to period based on management s perception of changing risks in the lending environment 
our evaluation process was designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this process attempts to assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by segregating the allowance for loan losses into three components specific  loss migration and general 
the specific component is established by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to individual classified credits on the basis of specific circumstances and assessments 
the loss migration component is calculated as a function of the historical loss migration experience of the internal loan credit risk rating categories 
the general component  composed of allocated and unallocated portions that supplement the first two components  includes our management s judgment of the effect of current and forecasted economic conditions on the borrowers abilities to repay  an evaluation of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the size of the overall loan portfolio  an evaluation of the composition of  and growth trends within  the loan portfolio  consideration of the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  net charge off trends  and other factors 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of our management 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
our allowance for loan loss is established for loan losses not yet recognized 
at december   we consider our allowance for loan losses to be our best estimate using the historical loan loss experience and our perception of variables potentially leading to deviation from the historical loss experience

net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  referred to as rate change 
the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table also reflects the amount of change attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period  it is not possible to allocate such changes between volume and rate 
for this table  changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate

the million decrease in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million unfavorable volume variance  combined with a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million unfavorable volume variance resulted from an million  or  decrease in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in average interest earning assets resulted primarily from lower investable funds as the result of a decline in our client deposits  which decreased million  or  from to the decrease in average interest earning assets was primarily concentrated in highly liquid  federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreement to resell  which decreased million 
average loans increased million  or  in as compared to  resulting in an million favorable volume variance 
although we continued to add high quality loans to our portfolio throughout  the current slowdown in our clients capital markets and venture capital funding reduced those opportunities and impeded our ability to increase loan balances 
average investment securities for decreased million  or  compared to  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
the decrease in investment securities was primarily centered in us agency securities and resulted from a corresponding decrease in client deposits 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in decreased a combined million  or  over the prior year  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
this decrease was a result of the aforementioned decline in investable funds related to the decline in our clients average deposit balances 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets combined to decrease interest income by million in  as compared to the prior year 
short term market interest rates decreased during the past year 
as a result  we earned lower yields during on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and our investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a combined million unfavorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
in  we incurred a million unfavorable rate variance associated with our loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans in decreased basis points to from in the prior year 
approximately of our loan balance was prime rated based at december   the majority of the remaining loan balance was fixed rate 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease primarily resulted from a decline in short term market rates  thus  we earned lower yields on each component of our interest earning assets 
the million increase in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million favorable volume variance  combined with a million favorable rate variance 
the million favorable volume variance resulted from a billion  or  increase in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the increase in average interest earning assets resulted from strong growth in our average deposits  which increased million  or  from to the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily centered in highly liquid  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell  and investment securities  which collectively increased billion 
average loans decreased million  or  in as compared to  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
while we increased the number of client lending relationships in most of our technology and life science industry sectors  as well as in specialized lending products  growth in our loan portfolio during had been impacted by several different factors 
first  many of our clients  primarily in the technology and life science sectors  had received significant cash inflows from the capital markets and venture capital community during the early part of this increase in the amount of equity raised by our clients had mitigated their need for debt from us 
second  beginning in  we began an initiative to reduce the average loan amount in our loan portfolio  and as a result  had reduced the average loan balance outstanding from approximately million in to approximately million by the end of this initiative was essentially complete as of the year end 
lastly  we exited several industry specific finance areas in  such as entertainment and healthcare services  reducing loans outstanding over million 
this initiative was essentially complete as of year end 
average investment securities for increased million  or  compared to  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
the strong growth in average deposits combined with fairly consistent average loans during  generated excess funds that were largely invested in us agency securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  and money market mutual funds 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in increased a combined million  or  over  resulting in a million favorable volume variance 
this increase was largely due to the aforementioned strong growth in average deposits during and our need to maintain a satisfactory level of liquidity 
favorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets combined to increase interest income by million in  as compared to short term market interest rates increased on an overall basis during as a result  we earned higher yields during on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and our investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a million favorable rate variance as compared to the prior year 
the average yield on loans in increased basis points from the respective prior year  accounting for the remaining million of the total favorable rate variance 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a basis points increase in our weighted average prime rate in as compared to the similar prior year period 
approximately of our loan balance was prime rate based at the end of the yield on average interest earning assets increased basis points in from this increase primarily resulted from a rise in the average yield on loans  largely due to an increase in our average prime rate  as well as an increase in short term market rates  which resulted in higher yields on federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreement to resell 
total interest expense in decreased million from this decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of million  combined with a favorable volume variance of million 
the favorable rate variance largely resulted from a reduction  between and in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product from to  and from to on our time deposit product 
the average cost of funds paid on average interest bearing liabilities in was  down from in this decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product and a basis point decrease on the average rate paid on our time deposit product 
interest expense in decreased million from this decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of million  offset by an unfavorable volume variance of million 
the favorable rate variance largely resulted from a reduction in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product  from in to in we took this action during the last half of in order to lower total deposits and total assets and thereby increase our tier leverage capital ratio 
as a result  the average bonus money market account balance decreased more than million from to however  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in average time deposits  which was related to cash securing letters of credit issued on behalf of our clients 
the average cost of funds paid on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from to this decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in our provision for loan losses in was principally in response to the decrease in net charge offs 
we incurred net charge offs of million in  compared to million in  and million in for a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses  see item critical accounting policies and item financial condition credit quality and the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income the following table summarizes the components of noninterest income for the past three years 
years ended december  dollars in thousands client investment fees    letter of credit and foreign exchange income   disposition of client warrants    deposit service charges    investment losses gains    other    total noninterest income    noninterest income decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was largely due to a million decrease in income from the disposition of client warrants  combined with a million decline in investment losses gains 
noninterest income increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was largely due to a million increase in income from the disposition of client warrants  coupled with a million increase in investment gains and a million increase in client investment fees 
client investment fees totaled million in compared to million in and million in we offer private label investment products to clients on which we earn fees ranging from to basis points on the average balance of these products 
at december   billion in client funds were invested in these private label investment products  including billion in the mutual fund products  as compared to billion and billion  respectively  for the increase in client investment fees of million reflects an increase in sales fees 
letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees  and other trade finance income totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from the million total in  and a decrease of million  or  from the million total in these decreases reflect a reduction in the volume of client foreign exchange transactions during versus the comparable prior year periods 
income from the disposition of client warrants totaled million in  compared to million in and million in we have historically obtained rights to acquire stock  in the form of warrants  in certain clients  primarily as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques we employ to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming 
the collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond our control  including the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment 
we therefore cannot predict the timing and amount of income with any degree of accuracy and it is likely to vary materially from period to period 
deposit service charges totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the million reported in  and an increase of million  or from the million in clients compensate us for depository services either through earnings credits computed on their demand deposit balances  or via explicit payments recognized as deposit service charges income 
clients earned lower credits in compared to due to lower average client deposit balances and lower market interest rates 
as such  our clients had fewer credits to offset explicit deposit service charges 
thus  we earned higher explicit deposit service charges in  as compared to and we incurred million in losses on investment securities in  compared to gains of in and gains of million in the losses primarily related to write down of certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments 
the net investment losses include million related to minority interest losses in svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp the gains primarily related to a gain of million realized on the sale of a venture capital fund investment  which completed its initial public offering in the gains primarily related to distributions received from venture capital fund investments 
all sales of available for sale investment securities were conducted as a normal component of our asset liability and liquidity management activities 
other noninterest income largely consisted of service based fee income  and totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in  as compared to and  was primarily due to increases of million in venture capital fund management fees and million in corporate finance fees 
additionally  we earned a higher volume of cash management and loan documentation services fees related to our growing client base 
noninterest expense noninterest expense in totaled million  a million  or  decrease from total noninterest expense was million in  an increase of million  or  from we closely monitor our level of noninterest expense using a variety of financial ratios  including the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of adjusted noninterest expense by adjusted revenues 
noninterest expense is adjusted to exclude amortization of investments in tax credit funds and  costs associate with other real estate owned  minority interest and retention and warrant incentive plans 
revenues are adjusted to exclude income associated with minority interest  the disposition of client warrants and gains or losses related to investment securities 
this ratio reflects the level of operating expense required to generate of operating revenue 
our efficiency ratio was for  compared to and in and  respectively

average fte personnel increased from in to in compensation and benefits expenses totaled million in  a million  or  increase over the million incurred in this increase was largely the result of an increase in the number of average full time equivalent personnel fte we employed in  combined with an increase in performance based compensation associated with our incentive bonuses and employee stock ownership plan 
average fte personnel increased from in to in the increase in fte personnel from through was primarily due to a combination of our efforts to develop and support new markets through geographic expansion  to develop and expand products  services  and industry sectors  and to build an infrastructure sufficient to support present and prospective business activities 
we are continuing our specific measures to control fte personnel during due to the current economic slowdown in our marketplace 
professional services expenses  which consist of costs associated with corporate legal services  litigation settlements  accounting and auditing services  consulting  and our board of directors totaled million in  a million  or  increase from the million total in we incurred million in professional services expenses in the increase in professional services expenses in  compared to  reflects the extensive efforts we have undertaken to continue to build and support our infrastructure  as well as evaluate and pursue new business opportunities 
the increasing trend in professional services expenses during the past three years also reflects our efforts in outsourcing several corporate functions  such as internal audit  facilities management and credit review  where we believe we can achieve a combination of cost savings and increased quality of service 
the increase in professional services in as compared to  primarily related to an increase in consulting fees associated with several business initiatives 
occupancy  furniture  and equipment expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in occupancy  furniture  and equipment expenses in as compared to  was primarily the result of an increase in personnel as well as the addition of new regional offices in northern california 
the increase in occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses in as compared to  was primarily attributable to certain nonrecurring costs in connection with the expansion of our existing corporate headquarters facility during the fourth quarter of  the addition of new regional offices  and an increase in recurring expenses associated with our additional office space 
business development and travel expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the million total in we incurred million in business development and travel expenses in the decrease in costs associated with business development  and travel expense in as compared to  was primarily due to our efforts to control noninterest expense 
the increase in business development and travel expense in  compared to  was largely attributable to overall growth in our business  including both an increase in the number of fte personnel and expansion into new geographic markets 
total telephone expenses were million in  million in  and million in postage and supplies expenses totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in both telephone expenses and postage and supplies expenses during each of the past two years resulted from overall growth in our business  including both an increase in the number of fte personnel and expansion into new geographic markets 
trust preferred securities distributions totaled million in   and these amounts resulted from the issuance of million in cumulative trust preferred securities during the second quarter of the trust preferred securities pay a fixed rate quarterly distribution of and have a maximum maturity of years 
advertising and promotion expenses totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in advertising and promotion expenses during was primarily the result of our effort to control noninterest expense 
the increase in advertising and promotion expenses during reflected our efforts to increase our marketing nationwide 
retention and warrant incentive plans expense totaled million in  million in  and million in under the provisions of the retention and warrant incentive plans  employees are compensated with a fixed percentage of gains realized on warrant and certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments 
the decrease in retention and warrant plans expense was directly related to the decline in warrant  venture capital fund  and direct equity investment gains over the comparable and periods 
other noninterest expenses  excluding the affect of tax credit fund investment amortization  totaled million in and million in and the increase in other noninterest expenses in  compared to and  was primarily attributable to higher insurance and data processing costs in as compared to and  primarily due to the overall growth in our business 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  compared to in and in the change in our effective income tax rate from to was primarily due to an increase in items giving rise to permanent tax benefits

minority interests the minority interest limited partner s share of losses related to svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp increased by a total of million between and the increase in minority interest limited partner losses was primarily due to a write down of minority interest owned investments of million 
the remaining increase in minority interest limited partner losses primarily related to fund management fees associated with svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp financial condition assets totaled billion at december   a decrease of billion  or compared to billion at december   primarily concentrated in a billion decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled a combined million at december   a decrease of billion  or  compared to the billion outstanding at the prior year end
