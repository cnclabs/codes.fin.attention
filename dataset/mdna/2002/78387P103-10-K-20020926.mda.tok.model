item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and sbs financial statements and notes thereto 
statements  other than statements of historical fact  that address activities  events or developments that sbs or management intends  expects  projects  believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward looking statements 
these statements include  but are not limited to  expected sales  gross margin  expectations of internally generated cash flows  new product introductions  and expectations of sg a and r d costs 
these statements and other forward looking statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by management of sbs in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors it believes to be appropriate 
these assumptions and assessments include the volume and product mix of sales  estimates of costs and inventory and receivable levels  defense spending levels  and other items 
the forward looking 
table of contents statements included in this report are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  supply and demand  governmental and technological factors affecting sbs operations  markets  products  services and prices 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments  and business decisions may differ from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
overview sbs designs and builds open architecture embedded computer products that enable oem s to serve the commercial  communications  enterprise and government markets 
sbs products are integrated into a variety of applications including communications networking  medical imaging  industrial automation and military systems 
the portfolio includes an extensive line of cpu boards  computer interconnections  avionics  telemetry  and fully integrated systems and enclosures that system designers can easily utilize to create a custom solution specific to the user s unique application 
sbs objective is to continue to capitalize on its design expertise and customer service capabilities to enhance product quality and reduce time to market for oem customers 
sbs has grown  and intends to continue to do so  through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
sbs completed ten acquisitions between and june  that broadened sbs product offerings and customer base 
sbs achieves internal growth by expanding its existing product lines through new product development  through increasing penetration of its existing customer base  and by adding new customers 
sales for the year ended june  were million  a decrease from the for fiscal year net loss for the year ended june  was million  or net loss per common share assuming dilution of 
this compares to net income for the year ended june  of million  or net income per common share assuming dilution of 
sbs performance during fiscal was affected by external factors  including dramatic changes in the markets that sbs serves  and internal factors  including changes in senior management and overall corporate strategy 
the net loss for fiscal includes million of inventory write downs  million of goodwill and identifiable intangible impairment charges  and million of severance and other employee termination costs 
see further discussion regarding these items below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in conjunction with the change in the chief executive officer and management s realignment of operations and market development efforts  sbs segment structure was redefined 
to better align similar technologies and selling channels  the former commercial group and the former government group were combined 
the combined group consists of sbs commercial  sbs government  or  ortec  and sbs avionics products division 
the communications and enterprise group consists of communications products  sdl  and industrial computers 
reportable segments for all periods presented have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used when accounting for items such as inventory  allowances for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization periods  income taxes  and intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and may require adjustment 
actual results could differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of sbs consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for additional accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized when goods are shipped to the customer  provided that sbs has received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
where customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized only when sbs is certain that the products meet all of the specified criteria for customer acceptance and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
inventory valuation 
sbs records inventory write downs based on estimates of obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  taking into account historical usage  forecasted future demand  and general market conditions 
write downs may also be recorded based on sbs decisions to discontinue the marketing of certain products or product lines 
if sbs forecasts are incorrect  market conditions deteriorate  or sbs decides to exit other product lines  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if market conditions or demand are better than expected  sbs may sell inventories that have been previously written down 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
sbs maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on the aging of sbs accounts receivable  sbs historical write off experience  and the current and projected financial condition of customers 
if sbs misinterprets the financial condition of customers or if the financial condition of customers deteriorates  additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required 
long lived and intangible assets 
sbs evaluates the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry or economic downturn  a significant decline in sbs market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the asset would be considered to be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
once deemed impaired  a charge to expense is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon sbs weighted average cost of capital 
estimates of future cash flows require significant judgement  and any change in these estimates may result in additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
sbs estimates of current and deferred income taxes reflect sbs assessment of current and future taxes to be paid or received on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
estimates of current income taxes include estimates for items such as general business credits and benefits from foreign sales 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax laws or review of sbs tax returns by taxing authorities 
recent acquisitions on march   sbs completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of essential communications  a division of publicly held intrusion  inc  for approximately million 
founded in  essential develops and delivers early stage infiniband products 
sbs utilizes essential s infiniband product expertise and industry relationships to build on its current infiniband efforts in the enterprise server and storage markets 
as required under the purchase method of accounting  essential s results of operations have been combined with sbs since the date of acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation  sbs recorded approximately  of identifiable intangibles  principally core technology assets  which are being amortized over a two year period 
no goodwill was recorded 
proforma results of operations are not presented as essential s results of operations in fiscal and were not material to sbs consolidated results of operations 

table of contents on april   sbs completed the acquisition of sdl 
located in mansfield  massachusetts  sdl specializes in the design  manufacture and sale of wan i o for the telecommunications and data communications markets 
sdl designs  manufactures  and markets t ei  t e  hssi and oc products based on the pci  compactpci  and pmc form factors  and supporting protocols such as frame relay  hdlc  ppp  x 
and atm 
in addition  sdl s products support the operating systems most commonly used in communications  including windows nt  solaris  and vxworks 
sbs acquired all of the outstanding stock of sdl for million in cash 
acquisition costs associated with the purchase were million 
the purchase price included million for the fair value of sbs options issued in exchange for unvested sdl options 
the acquisition was funded with existing cash and a million borrowing under sbs credit agreement with bank of america  na the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  whereby the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values 
identifiable intangibles are being amortized over four to eight years and goodwill is being amortized over ten years 
in connection with the acquisition  sbs recorded a million earnings charge  based on an assessment of purchased technology of sdl 
the assessment determined that million of sdl s purchase price represented technology that did not meet the accounting definitions of completed technology  and thus should be charged to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles 
the assessment analyzed certain products that were in various stages of completion ranging from of completion to of completion  with estimated completion dates ranging from the third quarter of calendar to the second quarter of calendar the value assigned to acquired ipr d was determined based on estimates of the resulting net cash flows from the evaluated technology of sdl and the discounting of those cash flows to present value 
in projecting net cash flows resulting from those products  management estimated revenues  cost of sales  selling expenses  research and development expenses  and income taxes for those products 
these estimates were based on the following assumptions estimated revenues projected a compound annual growth rate over seven years of 
projections of revenue growth were based on management s estimates of market size and growth  supported by analyst s estimates and by the nature and expected timing of the development of the products by sbs and its competitors 
the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenue  initially at declining to  was consistent with the historical rates for sdl s business as well as historical results of companies operating within the industry 
estimated selling expenses were expected to remain consistent as a percentage of sales  with an average of to 
the estimated research and development costs were expected to remain consistent as a percentage of sales at as most research and development efforts are in the maintenance phase 
an effective tax rate of was estimated 
the projected net cash flows for the in process projects were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise 
the wacc selected was based upon the risk return characteristics of the subject asset class 
a wacc of or was used to determine the value of the return of the core developed technology  the customer list and all other intangibles acquired as part of the purchase of sdl 
the fair value of the purchased technology was determined in accordance with the views expressed by the staff of the securities and exchange commission 
the financial results of sdl have been included in sbs consolidated financial statements from april  in fiscal  sdl s test  packaging and support functions were consolidated into communications products 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to recent order cancellations and a continued decline in sales and bookings  sbs recorded a million write down of goodwill and core developed technology associated with the acquisition of sdl 
this write down was based on sbs projection of undiscounted future operating cash flows of sdl over the remaining useful lives of the goodwill and core technology  which indicated that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the 
table of contents related goodwill and core technology 
as such  impairment charges were recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceeded fair value 
on december   sbs acquired scitech  a madison  wisconsin based designer and manufacturer of communications network i o products based on pmc and pci form factors 
the acquisition qualified as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes and constituted a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
under the terms of the agreement  scitech s shareholders exchanged all outstanding shares of scitech stock for  shares of sbs stock 
scitech was subsequently merged into communications products 
scitech s historical results do not have a material effect on combined financial position or results of operations  and as such  the financial position and results of operations of sbs and scitech are combined from october  on a prospective basis

unit shipments declined within the communications and enterprise group  primarily due to depressed market and economic conditions  customer order cancellations  and delays of shipment dates by several of the group s telecommunications infrastructure customers 
unit shipments of the commercial and government group s avionics  telemetry and computer processor products increased 
unit shipments of the group s general purpose i o products and computer connectivity and expansion unit products declined  due to unfavorable economic and market conditions and delays of shipment dates by several customers 
management does not expect significant improvement in the communications and commercial markets in fiscal management expects some growth in sales to government customers in fiscal due to an expected increase in department of defense development and field deployment expenditures 
actual results may vary materially 
gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased  or million  from million in fiscal  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales combined with million of expenditures associated with the sbs manufacturing consolidation and cost reduction efforts  a million 
table of contents inventory write down recorded during the second quarter of fiscal  and a million inventory write down recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal the second quarter write down consisted of inventory associated with programs that are not anticipated to come back to their previous forecasts  inventory associated with sbs decision to exit its legacy pci chassis product line  and inventory associated with sbs products that will no longer be marketed 
additionally  the implementation of a new inventory management methodology associated with the consolidation of sbs manufacturing operations contributed to the inventory write down 
the consolidation efforts included a reduction in the number of material handling employees and inventory specialists  a reduction in the amount of floor space for the storage of inventory  and the adoption of a purchasing methodology based on projected component part demand to achieve manufacturing and material handling efficiencies 
this new methodology calculates the maximum level of inventory to be maintained by comparing historical usage over a fixed period of time to forecasted future demand 
the consolidation efforts and new inventory methodology resulted in a reduction in required inventory levels 
the fourth quarter write down was primarily due to reduced demand for certain communications and enterprise group products 
as of june   approximately million of inventory previously written down had been utilized 
excluding the million of charges noted above  for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been  compared to for fiscal based on management s expectations of sales for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of sales is expected to be approximately

the remaining million represented the write down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquisition of sdl in april of the write down  which occurred in the fourth quarter  was based on sbs projection of undiscounted future operating cash flows 
this evaluation indicated that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  the impairment charge was recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeded fair value of the assets 
the evaluation was performed as a result of continued order cancellations and a continued decline in sales and bookings in the fourth quarter

new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  if any  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sbs adopted the provisions of sfas and sfas on july  sfas requires that sbs evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
sfas requires sbs to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  sbs is required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sbs is required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and sbs must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  sbs must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  
table of contents determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in sbs statement of earnings 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with the adoption of sfas and sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adoption of these standards of sbs financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  sbs will recognize a gain or loss on settlement

 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions

liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to sfas s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   but early application is encouraged 
sbs does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations
