critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared the consolidated financial statements of the wet seal  inc in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change is warranted 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
current trends and outlook our current fiscal year began on february  our comparable store sales as well as total sales were up significantly in february and march 
we have provided guidance with respect to our anticipated first quarter results in releases made public during this period 
we believe that consumer acceptance of our fashion offering continues to be positive resulting in increased sales in all of our operating divisions  especially our arden b 
division 
consequently  our board of directors has authorized capital expenditures of  in the current fiscal year to cover new store openings  store renovations and other capital expenditures described in liquidity and capital resources in this management discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report 
in a release dated february  we stated that the average new store will be approximately  square feet and each will require an investment of  we believe we can achieve sales of per square foot in these stores and  if we are successful  the return on the company s investment in the first full year of operations of the new stores is estimated to be approximately 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
management s decision to mark down merchandise is based on maintaining the freshness of our product offering 
markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory and to make room for new merchandise arriving daily to the stores 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required which could reduce our gross margin and operating income 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent markdowns which would adversely affect our operating results
