item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  and the related notes to financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase our oil and gas production and reserves while keeping our operating costs and our finding and development costs competitive with our industry peers 
over the last three years  we have invested million in oil and gas properties  found bcfe of proved reserves and replaced of our production at a finding and development cost of per mcfe 
the following table reflects our results during the last three years 
increase increase decrease decrease production oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    proved reserves oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    production costs per mcfe finding costs per mcfe percentage of production replaced barrels of oil are converted to mcf equivalents at the ratio of barrel of oil equals mcf of gas 
production costs include operating  transportation and net profits expense 
finding costs include acquisition  development and exploration costs including exploration costs such as seismic acquisition costs 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our notes to consolidated financial statements included on pages through in this report have a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  we recognize exploration costs and dry hole costs as an expense on the income statement when incurred and capitalize the costs of successful exploration wells as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
we use the successful efforts method because we believe that it more conservatively reflects on our balance sheet historical costs that have future value 
however  using successful efforts often causes our income statement to fluctuate significantly between reporting periods based on our success or failure during the periods 
proved reserve estimates unaffiliated reserve engineers prepare our oil and gas reserve estimates using guidelines put forth under gaap and by the securities and exchange commission 
the quality and quantity of data  the interpretation of the data  and the accuracy of mandated economic assumptions combined with the judgment exercised by the reserve engineers affect the accuracy of the estimated reserves 
in addition  drilling or production results after the date of the estimate may cause material revisions to the reserve estimates 
you should not assume that the present value of the future net cash flow disclosed in this report reflects the current market value of the oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization of oil and gas properties we calculate depletion  depreciation  and amortization expense dd a using the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
we segregate the costs for individual or contiguous properties or projects and record dd a of these property costs separately using the units of production method 
material downward revisions in reserves increase the dd a per unit and reduce net income  likewise  material upward revisions lower the dd a per unit and increase net income 
impairment of oil and gas properties because we account for our oil and gas properties separately  we assess our assets for impairment property by property rather than in one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
this method of assessment is another feature of successful efforts method of accounting 
certain unforeseeable events such as significantly decreased long term oil or gas prices  failure of a well or wells to perform as projected  insufficient data on reservoir performance  and or unexpected or increased costs may cause us to record an impairment expense on a particular property 
we measure the impairment expense as the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value measured by discounting the future net cash flow from the property at an appropriate rate 
we base our assessment of possible impairment using our best estimate of future prices  costs and expected net cash flow generated by a property 
actual prices  costs  discount rates  and net cash flow may vary from our estimates 
the above critical accounting policies can cause our net income to vary significantly from period to period as events or circumstances which trigger recognition as an expense for unsuccessful wells or impaired properties cannot be accurately forecast 
in addition  selling prices for our oil and gas fluctuate significantly 
therefore  to manage the company we focus more on cash flow from operations and on controlling our finding and development  operating  administration  and financing costs 
accounting for stock based compensation in june  the board of directors approved a contingent stock grant to our employees and directors 
in order for the grant to become effective  the price of our stock had to increase from per share to a trigger price of per share and close at or above per share for consecutive trading days 
when the board of directors approved the grant we did not record any amounts for expense  liability  or equity because the measurement date for determining the compensation cost depended on the occurrence of an event after the date of grant 
therefore  we could not be sure that we would incur any expense as a result of the grant  and we could not reasonably estimate the amount of possible expense 
january   became the measurement date when the stock price closed above the trigger price for the twentieth consecutive trading day 
on that date  we measured the total compensation cost at million which was the total number of shares granted multiplied by the market price on that date 
we recorded million as restricted common stock  million as unearned compensation reported as a separate reduction in stockholders equity on the balance sheet  and million as stock based compensation expense 
the million stock based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of included a catch up amortization from the date of the grant to the measurement date of the total compensation cost because the cost should be recognized over the time period in which the stock grant vested to the employees or directors 
we will amortize the remaining million compensation expense over the next five years as the shares vest 
the vesting period could accelerate in the event of a change in control of the company or the death or permanent disability of an employee 
a shorter vesting period would accelerate the amortization period 
except as noted above  the shares will be issued only to the extent the employees and directors remain with the company through the vesting dates 
in accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors  we have chosen to continue to apply the accounting method promulgated by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb rather than apply an alternative method permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas 
under apb  we do not record compensation expense on our income statement for stock options granted to employees or directors 
if we applied an alternative method permitted by fas  our net income would be lower than actually reported 
we disclose in our notes to consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our income statement if we were to record the estimated fair value of stock options on the date granted and amortize the expense over the expected vesting of the grant 
we chose the apb method because we believe that the use of the apb method makes our financial presentation easier to compare to the financial presentations of other publicly held companies  most of whom we believe also use the apb method 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations bank debt   other long term payables    office lease  total    other commercial commitments standby letter of credit a letter of credit in the amount of  was issued against our bank credit facility on march  on december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million 
our current ratio was to 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december   before changes in working capital  increased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily because of increased gas revenues partially offset by the million expense for the phillips petroleum settlement and increased production costs from new properties 
gas sales increased by million  or  because of a increase in gas production and a slight increase in the average price 
we incurred capital and exploration expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included million for exploration costs  million for development costs and million for the acquisition of properties including the south pass net profits interest from phillips petroleum 
during the year  we built and installed  or will install in  eight offshore platforms and facilities 
in addition  we drilled exploration wells and development wells in the gulf of mexico and exploration wells and development wells in mississippi and south texas 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploratory wells 
we project that we will spend million on wells in the gulf of mexico and million on onshore wells in south texas and mississippi 
the budget also includes million for platforms and development drilling on operated discoveries at eugene island  south marsh island  east cameron  west cameron  and one non operated development at eugene island the remaining million will be allocated to leasing  seismic acquisitions  and workovers 
we expect that our cash  estimated future cash flow from operations  and available bank line of credit will be adequate to fund these expenditures for the remainder of if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to acquire additional capital in order to finance completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the exploratory success and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to acquire sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing and or offerings of debt or equity 
as of december   our amended credit facility has a borrowing base of million 
as of march   we had million borrowed under the facility  and an additional  of credit availability was utilized to issue a letter of credit 
the banks review the borrowing base semi annually and may increase or decrease the borrowing base at their discretion relative to the new estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
the next redetermination is scheduled for april our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends 
unless renewed or extended  the line of credit expires on may   when all principal becomes due 
the most significant financial covenants in the line of credit include  among others  maintaining a minimum current ratio of to  a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of future net income and of any non redeemable preferred or common stock offerings  and interest coverage of to we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants in all material respects 
if we don t comply with these covenants  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
on may   we settled the litigation with phillips petroleum company and acquired phillips net profits interest in south pass block  offshore louisiana 
we paid million cash and issued  shares of our common stock as consideration for the settlement and assignment of the net profits interest 
subsequently  phillips sold  shares on the open market  and we purchased the remaining  shares at a total cost of million 
the shares issued to phillips were issued under a million shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission  the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes 
a substantial majority of the shares available under the shelf registration are unissued and are subject to being drawn down at the discretion of the company based on market prices and conditions 
during  holders of million face amount of the convertible notes due december   converted their notes into common stock at the prescribed conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each of principal amount of notes 
we redeemed the remaining  of the notes for cash at a call price of 
results of operations in  we recorded net income totaling million or basic income per share  and diluted income per share  compared to a net income of million or basic income per share and diluted income per share in the decrease in net income resulted primarily from the settlement expense related to the phillips petroleum litigation and higher dry hole and impairment costs 
in addition  net income for includes a million gain for the sale of certain south texas properties 
the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease oil production volume mbbls    oil sales revenue    price per bbl increase decrease in oil sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume  total increase decrease in oil sales revenue   gas production volume mmcf    gas sales revenue    price per mcf increase decrease in gas sales revenue due to change in prices  change in production volume   total increase decrease in gas sales revenue   compared to oil production increased by in compared to the prior year because of a increase in offshore gulf of mexico production partially offset by lower oil production from mississippi and south texas 
oil production from the gulf of mexico increased because of new wells that began producing in average oil prices decreased during which in turn caused oil revenues to be million lower 
gas revenue increased by million or because of a increase in production compared to production from the offshore gulf of mexico increased by bcf  or  while gas production from south texas decreased by bcf  or 
five offshore properties began to produce for the first time during and three additional offshore properties increased their production significantly either from new wells drilled and completed or because was their first full year of production 
we expected the decrease in production from south texas after we sold certain properties in the change in average prices did not affect total gas revenues significantly 
interest income decreased by  or because of lower rates earned on our short term investments and because we used the million of restricted cash previously set aside for the phillips petroleum judgment in the settlement of that litigation in may other income decreased because we had a non recurring million gain from the sale of south texas properties in operating costs and expenses increased by million  or  because of new producing properties 
however  operating expenses per mcfe increased to from  or less than 
exploration expenses increased by million  or  because of increased dry hole costs for two offshore and one onshore well compared to six onshore wells in offshore wells typically are significantly more costly than the onshore wells 
the impairment expense for primarily resulted from insufficient future net cash flow for three offshore gulf of mexico properties  which accounted for million  one south texas property which accounted for million  and one unproved offshore gulf of mexico property lease that was forfeited in which accounted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million because of production from new properties 
general and administrative expenses have remained substantially level with prior year amounts 
stock based compensation expense includes million for amortization of compensation costs related to the contingent stock grant and  for stock based directors fees 
on may   we settled the litigation with phillips petroleum company 
of the total million settlement  we had previously recorded million as an accrued liability 
we recorded million of the remaining million as additional settlement expense and capitalized million as the cost for our purchase of the net profits interest 
in addition  we charged the remaining million deferred net profits expense related to a royalty settlement in to the settlement expense 
during  we reached two separate agreements with the minerals management service concerning the royalties due on offshore gulf of mexico properties 
because of the agreements  we recorded expenses of million during interest and financing costs decreased because of lower interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt and because we are no longer accruing interest on the phillips judgment 
during  we recorded income tax expense totaling million  all of which is deferred 
we fully utilized our net deferred income tax benefit during and the first quarter of compared to oil production increased slightly compared to because of increased production from mississippi partially offset by lower oil production from the gulf of mexico 
oil production from mississippi increased by  barrels  or  during because of several new successful wells drilled during the year 
the average oil price increased by during compared to the prior year 
gas production increased by during compared to primarily from gas produced from the gulf of mexico and south texas 
gas production from the gulf of mexico increased by bcf  or  and gas production from south texas increased by  mcf  or  during the increase resulted from several successful wells drilled during the year 
the average gas price increased by during compared to other income increased by million because we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain south texas properties in august  partially offset by lower oil trading income 
operating expenses increased during the year compared to  mainly due to the increased number of producing properties and an increase in workover expenses mostly related to west cameron and eugene island exploration expense increased by  during primarily because of slightly higher dry hole costs in depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense increased by  during compared to the prior year largely as a result of increased production partially offset by lower finding costs per unit during the last three years 
impairment expense for the year primarily includes the costs for expired unproved properties compared to impairment expense for the year that included additional impairments for main pass and two small onshore properties 
legal expenses decreased  or  because we settled both the minerals management service issues and the minority stockholders litigation during the year  and we incurred lower costs related to the phillips litigation 
during  we reached two separate accords with the minerals management service concerning the alleged underpayment of oil and gas royalties 
the first agreement reached in may  concerned additional royalties asserted to be due on the settlement of litigation related to a gas sales contract 
because of this agreement  we recorded an expense of million in the first quarter of as to the second accord  we reached an agreement in october to settle the issues concerning oil transportation charges and oil exchange contracts for million 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in fair value be recorded currently in net income unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the definition of derivative contracts has also been expanded to include contracts that require physical delivery of oil and gas if the contract allows for net cash settlement 
we do not utilize any derivative instruments that fall under the criteria defined in the accounting standard and therefore the adoption of this statement did not have any effect on our reported financial statements or disclosures 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations will be effective for years beginning after june  the statement requires that we estimate the fair value for our asset retirement obligations dismantlement and abandonment of oil and gas wells and offshore platforms in the period in which the asset is first placed in service 
currently we accrue the estimated liability for dismantlement and abandonment over the life of the property using a unit of production method 
because of this new standard  effective january   we must increase both our recorded assets and liabilities by the estimated cost of the ultimate asset retirement obligation 
for properties owned at december   we estimate that amount to be million 
we will then discount the amount to present value  and on a periodic basis record the accretion of discount 
we will also amortize the cost into depletion  depreciation  and amortization expense 
the charges to the income statement will not be materially different under this standard as compared to our present method 
in august  financial accounting standards board issued the statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our balance sheet or income statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk sensitive instrument at december   is a revolving bank line of credit 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million which approximates its fair value 
the interest rate on this debt is based on a premium of to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the rate is reset periodically  usually every three months 
if on december   libor changed by one full percentage point basis points the fair value of our revolving debt would change by approximately  we have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
commodity price risk occasionally we sell forward portions of our production under physical product delivery contracts that by their terms cannot be settled in cash or other financial instruments 
such contracts are not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly we do not provide sensitivity analysis for such contracts 
for the period january   through june   we have physical delivery contracts in place to sell approximately  mmbtu of gas per day approximately of our projected gas production for that six month period at a price of approximately per mmbtu 
a vast majority of our production is sold on the spot markets 
accordingly  we are at risk for the volatility in the commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry
