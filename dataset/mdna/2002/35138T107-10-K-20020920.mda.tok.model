item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis of the fox entertainment group  inc s the company financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the company manages and reports its businesses in four segments filmed entertainment  which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide and the production of original television programming  television stations  which principally consist of the operation of broadcast television stations  television broadcast network  which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming  and cable network programming  which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed through cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators and professional sports team ownership 
in the first quarter of fiscal  management redefined its filmed entertainment segment to reflect a change in how the business is analyzed and evaluated 
the redefined segment includes all activities previously included in the filmed entertainment segment along with the activity of the former other television businesses segment  primarily comprised of divisions  which produce and distribute television programming and also distribute feature motion pictures 
prior year segments have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
sources of revenue filmed entertainment 
the filmed entertainment segment derives revenue from theatrical distribution  home video and dvd sales and distribution through pay per view  pay television services and broadcast television 
the revenues and operating results of the filmed entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the company s theatrical  home video and dvd releases  the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and the number of its television series on off network syndication 
theatrical release dates are determined by several factors  including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace 
each motion picture is a separate and distinct product  and its financial success depends upon many factors  including public acceptance 
television stations and television broadcast network 
the two reportable television segments derive their revenues principally from the sale of advertising time 
generally  advertising time is sold to national advertisers by the fox broadcasting company fox and to national spot and local advertisers by the company s group of owned and operated full power television broadcast stations o os  as of june   in their respective markets 
the sale of advertising time is affected by viewer demographics  program ratings and general market conditions 
adverse changes in the general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues 
cable network programming 
the cable network programming segment derives revenues from monthly affiliate fees based on the number of subscribers  net of the amortization of cable distribution investments  as well as from the sale of advertising time 
monthly affiliate fees are dependent on maintenance of carriage arrangements with cable television systems and dbs operators 
the sale of advertising time is affected by viewer demographics  program ratings and general market conditions 
adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force no 
eitf  accounting for the consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which was effective for the company as of january  this eitf  among other things  codified the issues and examples of eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no 
states that customer incentives which consist of the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to a cable or dbs operator to facilitate the launch of a cable network  should be presented as a reduction in revenue 
as required  the company has reclassified the amortization of cable distribution investments against revenues for all periods presented 
the amortization of cable distribution investments had previously been included in depreciation and amortization 
operating income  net income and earnings per share are not affected by this reclassification 
this reclassification affects the company s and the cable network programming segment s revenues 
the effect of the reclassification on the company s revenues is as follows for the year ended june  in millions gross revenues    amortization of cable distribution investments revenues    components of expenses filmed entertainment 
operating costs incurred by the filmed entertainment segment include exploitation costs  primarily prints and advertising  the amortization of capitalized production  overhead and interest costs  and participations and talent residuals 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  employee benefits  rent and other routine overhead 
television stations  television broadcast network and cable network programming 
operating expenses of the two reportable television segments and the cable network programming segment include expenses related to acquiring programming and rights to programming 
operating expenses also typically include production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcaster or cable network 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the broadcaster or cable network and sales commissions paid to the in house sales force involved in the sale of advertising as well as salaries  employee benefits  rent and other routine overhead 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
other operating charge 
the company has several multi year sports rights agreements  including a contract with the national football league nfl through fiscal year  contracts with the national association of stock car auto racing nascar through fiscal year and a contract with major league baseball mlb through fiscal year these contracts provide the company with the broadcast rights to certain national sporting events during their respective terms 
the nfl and nascar contracts contain certain early termination clauses that are exercisable by the nfl and nascar 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the rights costs against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related direct expenses over the expected contract lives 
at december   the company recorded an other operating charge of million 
this charge related to a change in accounting estimate on the company s national sports rights agreements caused by the downturn in the advertising market  which caused the company to write off programming costs inventory and to provide for estimated losses on these contracts over their estimated terms 
this evaluation considered the severe downturn in sports related advertising  the lack of any sustained advertising rebound subsequent to september th and the industry wide reduction of projected long term advertising growth rates  all of which resulted in the company s estimate of future directly attributable revenues associated with these contracts being lower than previously anticipated 
because the vast majority of costs incurred under these contracts are fixed  such as the rights costs and production costs  the results of these lower revenue estimates indicated that the company would generate a loss over the estimated remaining term of the sports contracts 
in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  the company has determined that the impact of the charge on basic and diluted earnings loss per share  net of tax benefit of million  for the year ended june  is loss per share 
the costs of these sports contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s operating profits to estimated total operating profit of the contract 
considering the provision of million for estimated losses and absent a difference between the actual future revenues and costs as compared to the estimated future revenues and costs  no operating profit or loss will be recognized by the company over the estimated remaining term of the sports contracts 
the profitability of these long term national sports contracts as discussed above is based on the company s best estimates at june   of directly attributable revenues and costs  such estimates may change in the future  and such changes may be significant 
should revenues decline from estimates applied at june   an additional loss will be recorded 
should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues  then none of the recorded loss will be restored  but the company will have a positive operating profit  which will be recognized over the estimated remaining contract term 
as of june   there have been no significant changes in the company s estimates from those employed as of december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
filmed entertainment and television programming costs 
accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period 
these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments 
filmed entertainment and television programming costs are amortized in the statement of operations in the direct proportion that revenues currently recognized bears to management s estimate of total revenues to be received throughout the life of each motion picture or television program 
estimates of revenues are reviewed and reassessed periodically on a title by title basis 
the television broadcast segment amortizes the costs of multi year sports contracts based on the ratio of each period s operating profit earned on the contract to the estimated total operating profit expected to be earned over the life of the contract from all segments 
estimates of total operating profit to be earned over the life of the contract are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary 
management s estimates of total operating profit over the life of the contract are primarily dependent upon their projections of the revenue to be derived from selling advertising spots in the games and other directly attributed revenue sources as well as direct selling costs and the direct costs associated with broadcasting the games or events 
at the inception of these contracts and periodically thereafter  the company evaluates the recoverability of the costs associated therewith against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related expenses 
sales returns 
at the time of sale  the company records as a reduction of revenue  the estimated impact of returns  rebates and other incentives 
in determining the estimate of home entertainment product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of the company s product 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales that provide the customer with the right of return 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors its customers payment profile and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
intangible assets 
the company has a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  fcc licenses  sports franchises  and other copyright products and trademarks 
intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity as compared to estimated amounts assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
the company assesses potential impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of fiscal year and does not expect a transitional impairment that will be material to its consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of our deferred tax assets  as the company believes that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
in making this estimate  management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event that management determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded against the deferred tax asset with a corresponding charge to income recognized in the period such determination was made 
employee costs 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  differences between actual results and assumptions are accumulated and amortized as part of net periodic pension costs over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
industry accounting practices revenue recognition 
revenues from theatrical distribution of feature films are recognized on the dates of exhibition 
revenues from home video and dvd distribution  net of a reserve for estimated returns  together with related costs  are recognized in the period in which the product is made widely available for sale by retailers 
revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast 
television advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired  net of agency commissions 
subscriber fees received from cable systems and dbs operators are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided  net of amortization of cable distribution investments 
revenues from professional team ownership are recognized on a game by game basis 
operating expenses 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual film forecast method 
under the individual film forecast method  such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management s estimate of the total revenues to be earned over a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title 
the costs of multi year national sports contracts for the television broadcast network segment are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s operating profit to estimated total operating profit of the contract 
the costs of sports contracts for the cable network programming segment and program rights for entertainment programs for the television stations segment are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  generally based on the usage of the program or term of the license 
original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title and contract basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or a writedown of the film or television asset to fair value 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted sop  which established new accounting standards for producers and distributors of films and supersedes sfas no 
sop establishes new accounting standards for  among other things  marketing and development costs 
the company recorded a one time  non cash charge of million  net of million tax  as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of july  this charge primarily reflects the elimination of marketing and certain development costs  which were previously capitalized under sfas no 
and are no longer capitalizable under sop subsequent to the adoption of sop  the company s accounting policy is to expense marketing and certain development costs as incurred 
use of operating income before depreciation and amortization management believes that an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company s business segments is operating income before depreciation and amortization 
operating income before depreciation and amortization provides a basis to measure liquidity and operating performance of each business segment 
although historical results  including operating income before depreciation and amortization  may not be indicative of future results as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences  operating income before depreciation and amortization provides management a measure to analyze operating performance against historical and competitors data 
operating income before depreciation and amortization eliminates the uneven effect across business segments of considerable amounts of depreciation and amortization primarily resulting from the value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization and the amortization of cable distribution investments 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of cable distribution investments represents a reduction against revenues over the term of a carriage arrangement and as such it is excluded from operating income before depreciation and amortization 
the following comparative discussion of the results of operations of the company includes  among other factors  an analysis of changes in business segment operating income before depreciation and amortization 
however  operating income before depreciation and amortization should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating income loss  net income loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
operating income before depreciation and amortization does not reflect cash available to fund requirements  and the items excluded from operating income before depreciation and amortization  such as depreciation and amortization  are significant components in assessing the company s financial performance 
pro forma results in order to enhance comparability  the following discussion of the company s results of operations is supplemented by pro forma financial information that assumes the acquisition of the acquired stations as defined below and midwest sports channel rsn north and the acquisition of the controlling interest in speed channel  inc  formerly speedvision networks  llc  speed channel  fox sports international and the sunshine network sunshine had occurred july  the pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions actually occurred at july   nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results

the amortization of cable distribution investments had previously been included in depreciation and amortization 
operating income  net income and earnings per share are not affected by this reclassification 
this reclassification affects the company s and the cable network programming segment s revenues

partially offsetting the other operating charge were improved results at the filmed entertainment and television stations segments 
equity losses of affiliates of million increased million from million in the preceding fiscal year 
these increased losses relate primarily to a non cash compensation charge of which the company s share is million recorded at fox family worldwide  inc ffw prior to the sale of the company s interests in ffw to the walt disney company disney 
in addition  the absence of earnings from the golf channel sold in june and increased losses at regional programming partners rpp and national geographic channel domestic  after its launch in january contributed to increased losses

filmed entertainment 
revenues at the filmed entertainment segment increased from  million for the year ended june  to  million for the year ended june  this increase is due to the worldwide theatrical  worldwide home entertainment and domestic pay television performance of planet of the apes  domestic theatrical and home entertainment performance of kiss of the dragon  the worldwide theatrical performance of ice age  the worldwide home entertainment performances of moulin rouge and dr

television stations 
on july   the company acquired the television broadcasting business of chris craft as defined below  consisting of ten television stations and subsequently exchanged three former chris craft stations with viacom  inc  clear channel communications  inc

this acquisition increased the number of the company s o os to full power stations 
the table below reflects the unaudited pro forma combined results of the television stations segment as if the acquisition of the acquired stations had taken place as of july  for the year ended june  change in millions revenues   operating income operating income before depreciation and amortization on a pro forma basis  for the year ended june   revenues at the television stations segment decreased million to  million from  million for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to the adverse impact of the september th terrorist attacks  which further weakened the advertising markets  partially offset by an estimated percentage point gain in market share over the prior year 
this market share gain resulted from the positive impact of non returning political advertising and the summer olympics broadcast during fiscal  syndicated programming of seinfeld  the replacement of fox kids programming with better rated programming and the telecast of major sporting events including the post season mlb  especially the seven game mlb world series  and the super bowl 
for the year ended june   operating income at the television stations segment increased by million to million from million in the prior year

fx affiliate revenues increased  reflecting a increase in average subscribers over the prior year 
as of june   fx reached over million households  an increase of million over the prior year 
despite the difficult advertising sales market  fx advertising revenues increased over the prior year  as the result of an increase in average audience and higher ratings  primarily due to the success of the shield  partially offset by declines in pricing 
affiliate revenues increased at the rsns primarily from increased average cable rates per subscriber  as well as increases in total subscribers 
advertising revenues for the rsns were even with the prior year  primarily resulting from the weak advertising market 
revenues at speed channel increased from the prior year primarily due to increased average audience and new programming 
as of june   speed channel reached nearly million households 
fox cable networks group s operating income increased million or for the twelve months ended june  revenue increases noted above primarily drove fox cable networks group s operating profit  partially offset by higher average rights fees associated with new professional sports rights agreements and an increase in the number of professional events telecast at the rsns  and increased programming and marketing costs associated with fx s fall prime time lineup and its new original series  the shield 
operating income before depreciation and amortization improved approximately from the year ended june  due to the reasons noted above

operating income before depreciation and amortization improved million from the prior year due to the reasons noted above 
other operating charge 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the rights costs against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related direct expenses over the expected contract lives 
at december   the company recorded an other operating charge of million in its consolidated statement of operations 
this charge related to a change in accounting estimate on the company s national sports rights agreements caused by the downturn in the advertising market  which caused the company to write off programming costs inventory and to provide for estimated losses on these contracts 
this evaluation considered the severe downturn in sports related advertising  the lack of any sustained advertising rebound subsequent to september th and the industry wide reduction of projected long term advertising growth rates  all of which resulted in the company s estimate of future directly attributable revenues associated with these contracts being lower than previously anticipated 
because the vast majority of costs incurred under these contracts are fixed  such as the rights costs and production costs  the results of these lower revenue estimates indicated that the company would generate a loss over the remaining term of the sports contracts 
the charge  by contract is as follows nfl for million  mlb for million and nascar for million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million for fiscal year from million to million due to a decrease in amounts due to affiliates of news corporation  the expiration of the new millennium film financing agreement in march and the classification of the expenses related to the new millennium ii film financing as minority interest in subsidiaries and lower amounts outstanding under single picture film financing 
equity losses of affiliates 
equity losses of affiliates for the year ended june  increased million to million from million in the prior year 
the primary reasons for the increase in equity losses of affiliates are a non cash compensation charge of which the company s share is million recorded before the sale of the company s interests in ffw

c the company sold its interests in the golf channel in june the company s share of national geographic channel domestic s losses were million for the year ended june   as compared to million in losses in the prior year 
as the channel launched in january  the growth in programming and advertising revenues was offset by the increase in the amortization of cable distribution investments in fiscal year also contributing to the losses was the increase in production and marketing expenses associated with a full year of operations 
as of june   national geographic channel domestic reached million households as compared to million households as of june  the company s share of rpp s losses was million for the year ended june   as compared to income of million for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to charges from the madison square garden msg division associated with the termination of two professional player contracts  the negative impact of losing the telecast rights of the new york yankees at msg network  lower revenues from the radio city music hall christmas spectacular as well as lower advertising revenues at its rsns 
these losses were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost savings at the metro channels and lower amortization of intangible assets resulting from rpp s implementation of sfas no 
effective january  minority interest in subsidiaries 
minority interest in subsidiaries increased million to million for the year ended june  due to the establishment of preferred interests in new millennium ii relating to the company s film financing arrangement  under which outstanding amounts are reflected as minority interest in subsidiaries in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

provision for income tax expense for the year ended june  increased to million from million in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the period decreased to compared to in the corresponding period of the preceding year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and utilizes derivative instruments in a limited manner to modify its exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
the company s policy is to enter into derivative and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its business objectives 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange rate risk the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize its limited exposure to exchange rate movements 
the foreign exchange contracts have principally been used to hedge the costs of producing films abroad and are principally denominated in the czech koruna  the euro  the mexican peso and the new zealand dollar 
the company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges 
at june   the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
consistent with the nature of the economic hedge provided by such foreign exchange contracts  such gains or losses largely would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases  respectively  in the us dollar value of future foreign currency obligations
