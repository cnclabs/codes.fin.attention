item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company provides integrated end to end solutions for wireless voice and data communication networks with service offerings that include high level technical consulting  system design and deployment and ongoing operations and maintenance services 
since its inception in  the company has delivered wireless network solutions to more than customers in over countries 
internationally based customers accounted for approximately excluding revenue from xm satellite of the company s revenues for the year ended december  in the last several years  the company has made several strategic decisions that have enabled it to focus on its core competency in providing end to end wireless services 
in october  the company disposed of its hardware and software products businesses and  in march  the company sold its telecommunication tower business 
in addition  during the last two years  the company has entered into a number of strategic acquisitions and investments to enhance its wireless capabilities with a particular focus on certain international markets 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment subject to rapid technological change and emergence of new technologies 
historically  the key drivers of growth in the company s wireless services business have been the issuance of new or additional licenses to wireless operators  the introduction of new services or technologies  increases in the number of subscribers served by wireless operators  and the increasing complexity of wireless systems in operation 
the company s primary sources of revenues are from engineering design and system deployment services 
prior to the sale of its tower business in march  tower lease revenues provided an additional source of revenues see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues from services are derived from fixed price and time and materials contracts 
the company recognizes revenues from fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
fixed price revenues as a percentage of total revenues were   and in   and  respectively 
with fixed price contracts the company recognizes revenue based on the ratio of individual contract costs incurred to date on a project compared with total estimated costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known and estimable 
the company recognizes revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
lease revenues from the tower business in and preceding periods are recognized over the term of the related lease 
cost of revenues includes direct compensation and benefits  living and travel expenses  payments to third party subcontractors and consultants  equipment rentals  expendable computer software and equipment  and allocated  or directly attributed  facility and overhead costs identifiable to projects 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation  benefits  office and occupancy  and other costs required for the finance  human resources  information systems  and executive office functions 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and other related expenses required to implement the company s marketing  sales and customer support plans 
trends that have affected or may affect results of operations and financial condition the company has continued to see tightened capital markets  which  among other things have contributed to a slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending 
the company s success depends upon continued growth in the design and deployment and optimization of wireless networks 
many wireless carriers are reliant upon the capital markets to obtain funds to finance building and improving their wireless networks 
most vulnerable are the customers that are new licensees and operator carriers who have limited sources of funds from operations or have business plans that are dependent on funding from the capital markets 
the slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending during caused some of the company s customers or potential customers to slow  postpone or reduce the scope of the deployment of new wireless networks or expansion of existing networks  which has reduced the demand for the company s services 
this slowdown is reflected in the company s year end backlog  which is at a historically low level 
this industry slowdown is occurring as the company needs to replace the revenue provided by the company s largest client in  xm satellite 
the xm satellite contract generated approximately and of the company s revenues for the twelve and three months ended december   respectively 
this contract was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of and the company cannot reasonably predict revenue that can be derived in the future from this customer 
the company s need to replace significant revenues as a result of the substantial completion of the xm satellite contract coupled with the slowdown in wireless telecommunication customer spending causes the company to expect revenues to decline in the first half of in addition  because the company may not be able to reduce its costs as fast as its revenues may decline  the company s costs as a percentage of revenues may increase 
these factors cause the company to believe that the first half of the year is not expected to be profitable 
see risk factors the company tends to derive a significant portion of revenue in any given year from a limited number of projects  and the company s inability to replace projects that are nearing or at completion with new contract awards would cause a significant decrease in revenues and negatively impact the company s results 
the company has seen renewed activity lately to upgrade or enhance existing systems 
despite this renewed activity  it remains uncertain the impact  if any  and the related timing of any such impact  upon the company s future revenue growth opportunities 
in europe  the increased availability of g equipment and the need for european carriers to meet building obligations associated with their g licenses  which represent a significant investment for the carriers  cause the company to be optimistic about european growth opportunities  which the company anticipates may contribute to revenue growth in the later half of while revenue from g networks only constituted of the company s revenues for the twelve months ended december   it is expected to be an area of business growth in and in the future 
in anticipation of this growth  the company has recently acquired additional deployment capability in europe 
in december  the company acquired transmast italia  a wireless infrastructure  deployment  civil engineering and project management firm located in milan  italy see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in january  the company acquired the assets of smith woolley telecom  a telecommunications consultancy company that specializes in the provision of search  acquisition  design  build  management and maintenance services to the wireless industry in the united kingdom see discussion in recent developments of item of this form k 
the company also anticipates that its reliance upon fixed price contracts will continue to grow in connection with these recent acquisitions 
these newly acquired international operations provide more support for network deployment and construction management  where use of fixed price contracts is more typical 
results of operations continuing operations the following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of revenues from the company s audited consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and the table and discussion which follow provide information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein

a slowdown in a large fixed price contract performed in the middle east contributed to million of the decreased revenues 
revenue declines in the united states of million also contributed to the decline  largely related to decreased customer spending on broadband and other wireless infrastructure spending 
a major driver for the decline in revenues was the slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending due to the tightening of the capital markets during the year

the decline in gross profit margin in is primarily attributable to additional items of cost  discussed in cost of revenues  and contract margin declines caused by increased competition driven by a slowdown in customer wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing was and for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributed both to reductions in agent commissions relative to the revenue decline of a large fixed price contract performed in the middle east as well as reductions from cost saving measures 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
general and administrative expenditures in include a net benefit of million due to the recovery of receivable balances written off in prior years from two bankrupt customers  offset by bad debt provisions for of million 
the provision for bad debt expense in is caused by a general tightening of the capital markets to customers in the wireless telecommunications market and increased incidence of bankruptcy filings among the company s customers and potential customers 
other increases in the general and administrative expenses in were related to employee severance and related costs of million  insurance costs of million  and other administrative costs associated with infrastructure to support anticipated international growth and expansion 
gain on sale of tower portfolio and administration  net during february  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of telecommunications towers that it owned 
as part of the sale agreement  the company agreed to lease unoccupied space on the towers  effectively guaranteeing a minimum rent level of million on the towers sold 
the gain from the tower portfolio sale deferred an amount corresponding to this rent commitment  until the space was leased to another tenant

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
interest income interest income was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
interest income in declined slightly over reflecting a decline in yields available for short term investments 
other income expense other income was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to an expense of million for the prior year 
other income in is largely attributable to the sale of all of the company s nextwave class b common stock and substantially all of its current debt claims against nextwave resulting in a gain of million 
the company also sold its investment in tecnosistemi  an italian telecommunications services company in which the company invested in september  resulting in a gain of million in other expense in the prior year was primarily due to losses from using the equity method of accounting for one of the company s investments

net income for also contained an unusual gain related to the sale of company assets included in other income of million 
excluding these unusual gains from the sale of the company s assets  the company earned net income of million and million in and  respectively 
the decreased earnings in are largely related to decreased gross profit  as discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the twelve months ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million or 
increased revenue in north america of million was the largest contributor to the growth  with the xm satellite contract providing of the north american increase 
other north american growth of million was derived from radio frequency design million and deployment million services 
also contributing to the increased service revenue  was growth in the middle east  asia  and europe million  offset by declines in central and latin america million 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million or 
during  the company evaluated certain employment related tax accruals recorded in prior years

as a result  the company reduced contract costs by million during as a percentage of total revenues  cost of revenues was and for december  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million or 
the gross profit increase is largely attributable to the increase in revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit was and for december  and  respectively 
the largest single factor contributing to the decline in gross profit margin is the reduction in tower rental revenue  which accounts for of the gross profit margin decline 
tower ownership and management revenues generate larger gross profits  but higher depreciation and administrative costs than revenues derived from services 
the balance of the margin decrease is attributable to large fixed price contracts  including a cost of revenue increase of million to reflect an increase in contract cost estimates in the fourth quarter of the contract cost increases in were offset by the reduction in employment related tax accruals discussed in cost of revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing was and for and  respectively 
increased revenue from large  end to end service contracts in enabled sales and marketing costs to increase at a lower rate than revenue growth 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million 
as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative cost was and for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures as a percent of revenue were unusually high due to large legal expenditures in relative to litigation with minority shareholders of microcell and support relative to the sale of discontinued operations 
additionally  the increased revenue from large  end to end service contracts enabled general and administrative costs to increase at a lower rate than revenue growth 
gain on sale of tower portfolio and administration  net during february  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of telecommunication towers that it owned 
through the end of december  tower sites were successfully conveyed resulting in a net gain of million 
as part of the sale agreement the company agreed to lease unoccupied space on the towers  effectively guaranteeing a minimum rent level of million on the towers sold 
the gain from the tower portfolio sale deferred an amount corresponding to this rent commitment  until the space was leased to another tenant 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in is a result of a reduction in assets due to the company s tower portfolio sale 
interest income expense interest income  net of interest expense  was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to an expense of million for the prior year 
the interest expense in was largely attributed to borrowings under the company s credit facility to finance the construction of towers 
the proceeds from the sale of the towers in provided sufficient proceeds to repay the company s credit facility and provide cash balances that generated interest income 
other expense other expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to an expense of million for the prior year 
the other expense in is attributable to losses using the equity method of accounting for the company s investment in tecnosistemi of million and to foreign currency losses of million  offset by a one time gain of million 
the loss in was largely driven by foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million relative to the company s latin america operations 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to a benefit of million for the prior year 
the provision for income taxes was recorded for the twelve months ended december   using an effective income tax rate of 
the effective income tax rate in excess of the statutory rate reflects the effect of non deductible expenses resulting from the tower portfolio sale 
the benefit for income taxes was recorded in based on an effective income tax rate of 
the change in effective income tax rates is due both to the impact of the sale of the telecommunication tower portfolio and to the conversion of the mci note during the third quarter of net income loss net income was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the prior year 
the increase in net income was due to income generated from the sale of the telecommunications towers conveyed during the year and additional gross profit generated by increased revenues 
discontinued operations in march  the company s board of directors adopted a plan to discontinue the operations comprising its hardware and software products businesses 
included in the assets of discontinued operations was a loss of million on discontinued operations revenue of million 
on october   the company closed on the sale of its hardware and software products businesses for million 
the gain on disposal in was million  which was net of the loss from discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash combined with short term investments at december  provides total liquid assets of million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
this increase in liquidity largely relates to the gains included in other income related to the sale of the nextwave assets million and the sale of tecnosistemi million  net of estimated tax payments associated with the gains 
cash used by operations was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the cash used from operations in was driven by taxes paid  largely related to the gain from investment and assets sold of million which is excluded from operating income 
cash flows from operations would have been million in  by excluding the million in taxes paid  using the effective tax rate  that are related to the gain from the investment and assets sold 
the cash used from operating activities in was a result of increased receivables from a large fixed price contract executed during the year 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the twelve months ended december  the largest source of the cash provided by investing activities was million in proceeds related to the sale of investments and assets and million in net proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
this was offset by the use of cash to make investments in affiliates of million and purchase property and equipment of million 
investing activities for the twelve months ended december  provided million 
cash provided from investing activities in was driven by proceeds from the tower portfolio sale of million 
offsetting the tower portfolio proceeds in was the net purchase of short term investments of million  purchase of minority shareholder interests of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and investments in affiliates of million 
cash from financing activities provided million and used million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the largest source of financing activities in was from the company s line of credit until the credit line was repaid with the tower portfolio sale proceeds during the same year 
the company s cash position negated the need for any significant financing activity during the twelve months ended december  working capital was million at december  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in working capital in was due to the gains included in other income related to the sale of the nextwave assets million and the sale of tecnosistemi million included in other income  net of estimated tax payments associated with the gains 
the company s primary requirement for working capital is to fund receivables relative to services performed 
with the substantial completion of the xm satellite contract  the company expects the first half of to generate an operating loss  which will also require working capital 
the company has no material cash commitments other than obligations under its operating leases 
future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of payments under contracts and increases in personnel in advance of new contracts 
the company had no debt and did not maintain a line of credit as of december   since it had cash and short term investments that it considered sufficient to meet liquidity requirements 
the company has not engaged in any off balance sheet financing as of december  the company believes it has sufficient assets and relationships with financial institutions to obtain a loan commitment should the business need arise 
for the short term  the company believes it has adequate cash and short term investments to satisfy cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the company also believes it will generate sufficient cash from operations to meet its long term liquidity needs 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to its foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in great britain  brazil  and egypt 
for its foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can impact the us dollar value of their reported earnings and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside the united states for the twelve months ended december  excluding xm satellite  the majority of which were in europe 
in connection with the company s recent acquisitions and the increased availability of g equipment in europe  the company anticipates continued growth of its international operations  particularly in europe  the middle east and africa  in and beyond 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar may have a significant impact on the reported results of the company 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies in the company s major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits are lower 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can impact the us dollar amount of shareholders equity of the company 
the assets and liabilities of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect at december  the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the dollar was stronger relative to many of the foreign currencies at december  compared to december  consequently  the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity increased million during the twelve months ended december  as of december   the total amount of long term intercompany receivable payables in non us subsidiaries subject to this equity adjustment  using the exchange rate as of the same date  was approximately million 
the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations due to the operations of and short term intercompany transactions with its consolidated foreign subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
foreign subsidiaries with amounts owed to us operations denominated in us dollars are great britain and brazil at december  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation losses from a hypothetical adverse change relative to these intercompany balances would be million 
in addition  a hypothetical adverse change would result in a million decline relative to operating losses generated outside the united states 
this was estimated using a deterioration factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to net income or loss for each of the subsidiaries in the respective period 
foreign exchange gains and losses recognized on any transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
although currency fluctuations can impact the company s reported results and shareholders equity  such fluctuations generally do not affect the company s cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses 
the company currently does not hedge any of these risks in its foreign subsidiaries because i the company s brazilian and egyptian subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and consequently  do not incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal operations  ii the british pound sterling  us dollar  and euro are relatively stable against each other  iii other foreign operations are minimal  and iv the company does not believe that hedging transactions are justified by the current exposure and cost at this time 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual of expatriate taxes  accounting for income taxes  and impairment of long lived assets and investments in affiliates 
revenue recognition policy the company s principal source of revenues consists of design and system deployment services 
the company provides design services on a contract basis  usually in a customized plan for each client and generally charges for engineering services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
the company generally offers its deployment services on a fixed price  time certain basis 
the portion of the company s revenue from fixed price contracts was in the company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
with the percentage of completion method  expenses on each project are recognized as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on the ratio of the current costs incurred for the project to the then estimated total costs of the project 
accordingly  revenue recognized in a given period depends on  among other things  the costs incurred on each individual project and its then current estimate of the total remaining costs to complete individual projects 
considerable judgment on the part of the company s management may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of the work to be completed  and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some task s 
if in any period the company significantly increases its estimate of the total costs to complete a project  it may recognize very little or no additional revenue with respect to that project 
for example  in  the company s gross profits were decreased by million because of increased costs to complete a project performed in the middle east 
if total contract cost estimates increase  gross profit for any single project may be significantly reduced or eliminated 
if the total contract cost estimates indicate that there is a loss  the loss is recognized in the period the determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual of expatriate taxes the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  the company s management must make estimates on the uncollectability of its accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
for the year ended december   the company derived of its total revenues from its ten largest customers  indicating significant customer concentration risk with the company s receivables 
these ten largest customers constituted of the company s net receivable balance as of december  in addition  fixed price contracts with unfavorable milestone payments can cause unbilled receivables to grow prior to achieving the applicable milestone that permits billing 
lastly  the company frequently performs services for development stage customers  which carry a higher degree of risk  particularly as to the collection of accounts receivable 
these customers may be particularly vulnerable to current tightening of available credit and general economic slowdown 
for example  xm satellite has billed receivable balances outstanding at december  of million and unbilled receivables of million 
the company estimates liabilities associated with taxes relative to employees sent to assignments in foreign countries 
these expatriate employees are reimbursed for additional personal income tax burden that was derived as a result of the assignment 
calculation of these obligations takes considerable knowledge of payroll  social  and other taxes in multiple countries  and the employee s personal tax situation 
in addition  it requires interpretation of tax laws  an assessment of potential audit risk from tax authorities  and often the resolution of the tax liabilities may not occur for several years 
for example  in  the company s gross profits were decreased by million because of an additional provision for expatriate employees reimbursed taxes 
the company has million accrued for expatriate tax obligations as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements an estimate for income taxes is required for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process requires estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of foreign net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event the actual results differ from these estimates the company may need to increase or decrease its valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax assets  as of december  were million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
impairment of investments in affiliates the company maintains investments in affiliates of million as of december  these investments are accounted for at cost 
factors considered to determine whether these investments in affiliates are impaired include the unaudited financial results of the affiliated companies and availability of equity transactions with independent third parties in these affiliates 
related party transactions the company provided services to telcom ventures and various other companies that are majority owned  or controlled by  telcom ventures or its members 
the company s relationship with telcom ventures may result in potential conflicts of interest see risk factors the company s relationship with telcom ventures may result in potential conflicts of interest 
revenues from telcom ventures are not material  providing  and of  and revenues  respectively

receivables from xm satellite were million and million at december  and  respectively
