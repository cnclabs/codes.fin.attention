table of contents net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads 
average net net earning interest interest dollars in thousands assets spread income interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity average net net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity average net net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity yield on earning assets net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and million in the increase from occurred because the decline in interest expense outpaced the decline in interest income 
specifically  interest expense fell million while interest income dropped million 
the overall lower interest rate environment in  compared with the prior year  had the following effect on interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the average yield on earning assets dropped basis points from in to in lowering interest income by million 
lower outstanding balances on total average earning assets caused interest income to decrease million from year ago levels 
average loan outstandings were million higher than last year  but lower rates earned on the loans lessened interest income by million 
a combination of lower securities balances  as well as a lower yield earned on those balances  decreased securities interest income by million 
the decline in interest expense was primarily rate driven as lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings accounted for million  or  of the decrease in interest expense compared to last year 
as discussed in the deposits and wholesale borrowings section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results  the corporation placed less reliance on certificates of deposits and wholesale borrowings to fund loans and operations in specifically  average outstandings for certificates of deposits cds and wholesale borrowings lessened interest expense in by million and 
table of contents million  respectively 
lower interest rates paid on these same instruments caused interest expense to decline million on cds and million on wholesale borrowings 
the cost of funds for the year  as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased basis points from in to in the following table illustrates the specific year over year impact to net interest income based on changes in the rate and volume components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as discussed in the previous section  the increase in the net interest margin during was primarily a result of lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings outpacing lower yields earned on loans and securities

dollars in thousands trust fees service charges on deposits credit card fees atm and other service fees bank owned life insurance income investment services and life insurance fees gain from the sale of partnership interest manufactured housing income investment securities gains loan sales and servicing other operating income trust fees decreased million  or  to million in the decline was directly attributable to lower stock market returns in the current year compared to s market results 
that is  fees tied to new accounts and account activity were less due to lower stock market investments  and fees associated with period end portfolio balances were down because of lower market values at quarter and year ends 
service charges on deposits rose million  or  compared to last year 
these fees are primarily based on the number of accounts  average account balances and customer checking and savings account activity 
credit card fees rose million or in the increase was due to higher debit card volume  increased merchant activity  and competitive cash advance and late fees 
bank owned life insurance income increased million from last year as a result of an additional investment in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter  the corporation sold an interest in a real estate partnership realizing a gain of million 
loan sales and servicing income was up due to increased mortgage and home equity loan origination  refinancing and sales activity during the declining interest rate environment 
other operating income totaled million for and includes a million restructure charge associated with the write down of a manufactured housing subsidiary s premises and equipment 
as discussed throughout this document  restructure charges are associated with the exit from the manufactured housing financing business 
excluding the restructure charge  other operating income would have totaled million 
excluding securities gains and the restructure charge mentioned in the preceding paragraph  other income as a percentage of net revenue equaled  up from last year

the decrease in salaries and wages were primarily attributable to continued emphasis on efficiency 
taxes  other than federal income taxes  declined million or mainly due to lower ohio franchise taxes paid in telephone expenses were down or as streamlining the communications systems throughout the organization continues 
the fdic assessment paid on customer deposits declined commensurate with lower deposit balances at the measurement dates 
intangible amortization was million less in the current year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on new goodwill and other intangible asset accounting pronouncements 
these new guidelines are expected to lower intangible asset amortization expense in and future periods 
net occupancy and equipment expenses were relatively unchanged from the prior year 
advertising and professional service fees increased almost each 
additional emphasis on promotion of core deposit and retail loan products accounted for most of the rise in advertising expense while higher costs associated with past due loan balances accounted for the majority of the rise in professional fees 
bankcard and other loan processing costs increased million as new loan and refinancing activity for several loan categories was considerably higher in as a result of interest rates approaching or exceeding historical lows 
offsetting the higher loan processing costs were higher loan sales and servicing fees as noted in the preceding other income section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results 
the efficiency ratio for was compared to in and in the lower is better efficiency ratio indicates the percentage of operating costs that is used to generate each dollar of net revenue that is  during  cents were spent to generate each of net revenue

mortgage loans  primarily single family properties  continue to be originated by the corporation s mortgage subsidiary and then sold into the secondary mortgage market 
the year over year decline in residential mortgage loans held on the corporation s balance sheet totaled million  or 
the decline in these balances is intentional as proceeds from the paydown of principal are used to fund higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
home equity and credit card outstandings increased over each since december  these higher yielding loans continue to be emphasized in the corporation s sales efforts 
installment loans increased million  or  mainly due to higher used car originations

the charges associated with exiting this business  as well as further discussion regarding the reasons for the change  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements and the other income and other expenses sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
there is no concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
most of the corporation s business activity is with customers located within the state of ohio 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for loan losses 
firstmerit and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowances through ongoing reviews of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  non performing assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio

successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiary bank  participating in approval of the largest loans  conducting reviews of loan portfolios  providing centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing loan workouts 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

for the same period  total nonperforming loans earned million in interest income 
had they been paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on non accrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million 
in addition to nonperforming loans and loans days past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem loans totaling million at year end these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans 
deposits average deposits for both and totaled billion  an increase of when compared to levels 
even though total deposits were the same as last year  the mix of customer accounts changed as the declining interest rate environment  as well as uncertainty in the stock market  influenced depositors to become more liquid 
as a result  higher costing cds were replaced by lower yielding  but more liquid  checking  savings and money market accounts 
a more specific accounting of the changes in mix are given in the following paragraph

table of contents interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the analysis presented below divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within days subsequent to year end  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings certificate and time deposits wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk reside in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on corporation s balance sheet consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
options risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in 
table of contents administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using sophisticated and detailed risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of year end and immediate change in rates bp bp bp bp december  not relevant    december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a sophisticated data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities  eg  savings  money market and now accounts  balance trends and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
each year the forecasting accuracy of the model is tested in a back test study 
this study measures how closely the model would have predicted future net interest income by substituting actual interest rates and balance sheet volumes in a historical model  such as the risk model from one year ago 
all other assumptions remain as they were in the historical model 
net interest income is simulated and compared to actual results 
the results of the back test performed in  using the volatile period of january through november  showed the model s assumptions were appropriate as simulated net interest income was within of realized net interest income 
alco and the board of directors review the results of the back test study 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of all cash flows on the balance sheet under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allows management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses funds 
in addition  the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities and unused wholesale sources of liquidity 
the corporation is able to raise significant liquidity in the form of deposit gathering campaigns 
during  the corporation s indexed money market account product balances increased by million to million 
the products pricing features limited disintermediation from other lower cost bank deposit products 
funding trends for the year 
during  investment portfolio maturities and cash flows were used to pay down short term borrowings 
on average the investment portfolio decreased million while wholesale borrowings decreased million 
retail cds decreased million on average as higher rate cds were allowed to mature 
growth in lower cost non maturity deposits exceeded the run off retail cds as total deposits increased by million 
index money market account balances increased million on average  as the rate paid on the accounts was attractive in a falling rate environment 
parent company liquidity 
firstmerit corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from the bank subsidiary 
during  firstmerit bank paid firstmerit corporation a total of million in dividends 
as of year end  firstmerit bank had an additional million available to pay dividends 
table of contents without regulatory approval 
in addition  the parent company has a million revolving loan commitment from a syndicate of banks  which is used for general corporate purposes 
the loan commitment is repaid with earnings from the banking subsidiary 
the pricing on the loan commitment is based on libor  the outstanding balance at year end was regulation and supervision a strict uniform system of capital based regulation of financial institutions became effective on december  under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  the corporation and its subsidiaries all exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this annual report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement information in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section within this report  which is not historical or factual in nature  and which relates to expectations for future shifts in loan portfolio to consumer and commercial loans  increase in core deposits base  allowance for loan losses  demands for firstmerit services and products  future services and products to be offered  increased numbers of customers  and like items  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following factors are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the banking industry  the regulatory environment  rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards  competitive factors  including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions  new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures  and like items 
firstmerit cautions that any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of firstmerit in this report  in other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon the factors listed above and like items
