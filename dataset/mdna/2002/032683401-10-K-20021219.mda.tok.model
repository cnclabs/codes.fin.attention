overview the company  founded in  is a provider of data conversion and digital mapping services to users of customized geographic information systems 
the company experiences yearly and quarterly fluctuations in production costs  salaries  wages and related benefits and subcontractor costs 
these costs may vary as a percentage of sales from period to period 
the company utilizes infotech enterprises ltd  an india based company  for a significant percentage of its offshore production services 
backlog increases when new contracts are signed and decreases as revenues are recognized 
changes in macroeconomic and industry market conditions were first encountered in fiscal and have continued through fiscal these changes have resulted in a reduction of timely order flow to the company 
at september   backlog was million as compared with million at september  management believes these adverse market conditions were and continue to be primarily caused by the recessionary economic climate  consolidation in the utility industry  the company s adverse financial results for fiscal years and and increased competition from companies with offshore operations 
a number of the projects awarded to the company are greater than million or longer than two years in duration  which can increase the company s risk due to inflation  as well as changes in customer expectations and funding availability 
the company s contracts are generally terminable on short notice  and while in the company s experience such termination is rare  there is no assurance that the company will receive all of the revenue anticipated under signed contracts 
see item business risk factors and risks associated with terms of customer contracts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a cost to cost basis 
for each contract  an estimate of total production costs is determined and these estimates are reevaluated monthly 
the cost estimation process requires substantial judgements 
the duration of the contracts and the technical challenges included in certain contracts affect the company s ability to estimate costs precisely 
production costs consist of internal costs  primarily salaries and wages  and external costs  primarily subcontractor costs 
internal and external production costs may vary considerably among projects and during the course of completion of each project 
at each accounting period  the percentage of completion is based on production costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated production costs for each of the company s contracts 
this percentage is then multiplied by the contract s total value to calculate the sales revenue to be recognized 
the percentage of completion is affected by any factors which influence either the estimate of future productivity or the production cost per hour used to determine future costs 
the company recognizes losses on contracts in the period such loss is determined 
sales and marketing expenses associated with obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred 
valuation of accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management routinely assesses the financial condition of the company s customers and the markets in which these customers participate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
litigation 
the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise from the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgment based on professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the criteria of sfas  amounts are recorded as charges to net earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
income taxes 
the year was the first year out of the last three in which we have reported net income and taxable income 
these prior year losses generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward of approximately million as of september  generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our recent history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding our future operations as discussed above  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
impairment of goodwill 
long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their fair value 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the company has written off all remaining goodwill in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years ended september   and  selected consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales percentage of sales revenues costs and expenses salaries  wages and benefits subcontractor costs other general and administrative bad debts depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill severance and related costs gain on sale of assets earnings loss from operations other income expense  net earnings loss before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income taxes benefit net earnings loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle extraordinary gain loss cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net earnings loss fiscal years ended september  and revenues

new regulations allowed the company to claim a refund of taxes paid in prior years by increasing the carryback period of its federal net operating loss generated in fiscal year from two years to five years 
the company continues to project zero tax expense for fiscal  excluding the benefit from this change in tax law 
also  as a result of the uncertainty that sufficient future taxable income can be recognized to realize additional deferred tax assets  no additional income tax benefit has been recognized for fiscal in fiscal  tax expense of million was recognized to reflect the uncertainty that sufficient taxable income could be recognized to realize the deferred tax asset 
extraordinary gain loss on extinguishment of debt  net of tax

net loss of million in fiscal is a million improvement over the million net loss in fiscal as discussed above  significant non recurring events and improved operational results contributed to the variance 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s principal source of liquidity has consisted of cash flow from operations supplemented by secured lines of credit and other borrowings 
though the company did not have a working capital line of credit as of september   other borrowings consisted of a million senior secured convertible note and a  unsecured promissory note 
the  unsecured promissory note matures on march  and bears interest at prime rate plus one percent at september  
the million senior secured convertible note  which has a face value of million maturing april   bears interest at an annual rate of five percent  but interest is not payable until maturity 
the senior secured convertible note may be converted to common stock as described below 
the senior secured convertible note is convertible at any time into common stock of the company at a price equal to the least of i  ii of the average closing bid prices of the common stock for the trading days ending the trading date immediately preceding the closing date of april  calculated to be  and iii of the average closing bid prices for the trading days having the lowest closing bid price during the trading days immediately prior to the conversion date  but under any event  the number of shares issuable upon full conversion of the note must constitute at least of the issued and outstanding shares  on a fully diluted basis  as of the date of full conversion 
assuming a conversion price of per share  asi would issue  shares of common stock if the note were fully converted 
at the time of conversion  any unpaid interest is paid in shares of common stock 
the note is subject to mandatory conversion in three years and is secured by all of the assets of the company 
all amounts and prices have been adjusted to reflect the one for ten reverse split of common stock that became effective october  the holder of the senior secured convertible note holder also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock subject to adjustment 
one whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire an additional share of common stock at an exercise price equal to of the conversion price of the note 
assuming an exercise price of per share of  the aggregate exercise price for the warrants would be million for the issuance of  shares of common stock  but the shares issuable upon conversion of the note and exercise of warrants are to be no less than of the outstanding common stock unless the holder exercises the warrants in a cashless exercise where the holder uses the value of some of the warrants to pay the exercise price for other warrants 
if at the time of conversion of the note  the price of the common stock has dropped below per share  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the note and upon exercise of the warrants would increase 
similarly  if asi issues shares of common stock at a price of less than per share  the conversion price and the exercise price decrease to that lower price  and the number of shares issuable under the note and the warrants would therefore increase 
asi is required to register the shares underlying the note and warrants 
also  asi is generally restricted from issuing additional equity securities without the holder s consent  and the holder has a right of first refusal as to certain subsequent financings 
in addition  the company is obligated to continue the listing of its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market pursuant to the note and warrant purchase agreement entered into with tonga partners  lp  its controlling beneficial shareholder  and any breach of this obligation might result in the acceleration of the company s obligations under the senior secured convertible note payable to tonga partners  lp as part of the transaction  the holder was granted the opportunity to appoint a majority of asi s board of directors and  as a result  controls asi 
in addition  upon exercise of the warrants and conversion of the note  the holder will own a majority of the common stock  thereby giving the holder additional control over asi 
on december   the company issued million shares of no par value series a preferred stock  at an original issue price of per share 
the company is entitled to redeem the shares within one year of issuance at per share million  and the redemption price increases 
per year until the fifth anniversary  at which time the shares must be redeemed at a price of per share 
as of the date of this report  we have not redeemed the shares 
the agreement calls for a mandatory payment of  by the third anniversary 
the preferred stock earns a dividend at the annual rate of of the then redemption price on a cumulative  non participating basis and has a liquidation preference equal to the then redemption value of shares outstanding at the time of such liquidation 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
during the fiscal years of through  the company experienced significant operating losses with corresponding reductions in working capital and net worth  excluding the impact of debt forgiveness  and does not currently have any external financing in place to support operating cash flow requirements 
the company s revenues and backlog have also decreased substantially during the same period 
the company s senior secured convertible note also has certain immediate call provisions that are outside the company s control  which if triggered and exercised  would make it difficult for the company to meet these debt payments 
these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
to address the potential going concern issue  management implemented financial and operational restructuring plans designed to improve operating efficiencies  reduce and eliminate cash losses and position the company for profitable operations 
financial steps included restructuring the company s bank debt through the issuance of preferred stock and convertible debt  subsequent collection of the federal income tax refund and sale of non core assets 
operational steps included the consolidation of production services to two solution centers  reduction of corporate and non core spending activities  outsourcing certain components of projects and deploying a new sales and marketing team 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
however  management believes that its turnaround efforts  if successful  will improve operations and generate sufficient cash to meet its obligations in a timely manner 
in the absence of a line of credit and limitations on securing additional debt  the company depends on internal cash flow to sustain operations 
internal cash flow is significantly affected by customer contract terms and progress achieved on projects 
fluctuations in internal cash flow are reflected in three contract related accounts accounts receivable  revenues in excess of billings  and billings in excess of revenues 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting accounts receivable is created when an amount becomes due from a customer  which typically occurs when an event specified in the contract triggers a billing 
revenues in excess of billings occur when the company has performed under a contract even though a billing event has not been triggered 
billings in excess of revenues occur when the company receives an advance or deposit against work yet to be performed 
these accounts  which represent a significant investment by asi in its business  affect the company s cash flow as projects are signed  performed  billed and collected 
at september   the company had multiple contracts with three customers that represented  and  respectively of the total balance of net accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings 
at september   these customers represented  and  respectively of the total balance of net accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings 
billing terms are negotiated in a competitive environment and  as stated above  are based on reaching project milestones 
the company anticipates that sufficient billing milestones will be achieved during fiscal such that revenue in excess of billings for these customer contracts will begin to decline 
the company s operating activities provided positive cash flow of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and breakeven in fiscal contract related accounts described in the previous paragraph declined million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
a significant portion of this decline in resulted from contract cost to complete adjustments  which reduced revenues in excess of billing without providing cash flow 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million in fiscal  million in fiscal and increased million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects the company s reduced size of operations  in part due to the sale of its colorado springs  colorado office 
cash provided by investing activities principally consisted of proceeds from sales of assets  offset by the purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements 
in fiscal year  the company enhanced cash flow by million from the sale of assets  primarily from the sale of colorado assets 
the company purchased equipment and leasehold improvements totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
financing activities consisted primarily of net borrowings and payments under lines of credit for working capital purposes and net borrowings and payments of long term debt used in operations and the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company may from time to time employ risk management techniques such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedging transactions 
none of these techniques is used for speculative or trading purposes and the amounts involved are not considered material 
short term interest rate changes would have little impact on the company s interest expense due to its lack of any material variable interest rate debt
