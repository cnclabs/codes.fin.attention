third wave s proprietary products and technologies position the company to exploit the growing market opportunity for genetic analysis products 
our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in the demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and deliveries made during the quarter  the timing of research  development and grant revenues  and increases in spending  including expenses related to our ongoing scale up of product development and manufacturing capabilities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets impairment equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets 
for assets removed from service and held for sale or abandoned we estimate the fair market value of such assets and record an adjustment if fair market value is lower than carrying value 
such analyses necessarily involve significant judgment 
during  we recorded a charge of approximately  classified in general and administrative expenses to write down certain equipment to its net realizable value 
derivative instruments we sell products in a number of countries throughout the world 
during  we sold certain products with the resulting accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
simultaneous with such sales  we purchased foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with collections of receivables denominated in foreign currencies in the normal course of business 
these derivative instruments have maturities of less than one year and are intended to offset the effect of transaction gains and losses 
there were no contracts outstanding at december  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the loss or gain on the hedged asset relating to the risk being hedged are recorded currently in earnings 
significant customer we generated approximately of our revenues from sales to one end user customer in the japanese government 
as of december   none of our accounts receivable were attributable to this customer 
if our primary customer would experience significant adverse conditions  they may not be able to complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing firm sale commitments 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because of process improvements or technology advancements  the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or estimates of shelf lives may change 
we currently consider all inventory that we expect will have no activity within one year as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be subject to a provision for excess inventory 
we also provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as changing manufacturing processes and technologies 
at december   our inventory reserves were million  or of our million total gross inventories 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   of million represents an increase of million as compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase in product sales was the result of increasing sales of the invader products  which are consumable tests and reagents used for dna and rna analysis in research and clinical applications 
product sales during were above our original expectations because our largest customer accelerated its purchases of our proprietary cleavase enzyme 
the customer will use the enzyme in conjunction with previously delivered invader snp probes sets  as well as those planned to be delivered over the remainder of the project 
development revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to development work being done on a development and commercialization agreement with bml  inc bml 
under the agreement  we are developing assays in accordance with a mutually agreed development program for use in clinical applications by bml 
this development is expected to be completed by the end of cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of materials used in the manufacture of product  depreciation on manufacturing capital equipment  salaries and related expenses for management and personnel associated with our manufacturing and quality control departments and amortization of licenses and litigation settlement fees 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the increased material expenses as a result of higher product sales and costs incurred as we put in place additional manufacturing capacity to meet accelerating demand for our invader products 
the increase in cost of goods sold is also attributable to an increase in a non cash charge for amortization of litigation settlement costs and reacquired marketing and distribution rights

interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to less than million in the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due to additional debt related to the capital equipment financing completed in september  and the convertible note payable from december liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  research grants from federal and state government agencies  payments from strategic collaborators  equipment loans  capital leases  sale of products  a convertible note and an initial public offering in february as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million

at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of federal tax laws and similar state provisions as a result of our initial public offering 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following our progress with our research and development programs  our level of success in selling our products and technologies  our ability to establish and maintain successful collaborative relationships  the costs we incur in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the timing of purchases of additional capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and due to their short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
to reduce foreign exchange risk  we selectively use financial instruments 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations 
our policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for profit 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k
