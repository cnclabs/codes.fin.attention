item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion  as well as other portions of this annual report on form k  contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates  and beliefs 
words such as anticipates  plans  estimates  expects  believes  and similar expressions often identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could materially differ from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and particularly in risk factors 
unless otherwise noted  discussions relating to our common stock reflect the effects of the two for one common stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november  general our fiscal year includes or weeks and ends on the saturday closest to january references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began 
our fiscal year ended on february  and fiscal year ended on january  and each contained weeks 
our fiscal year ended on february  and contained weeks 
all references herein to fiscal relate to the weeks ending february  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of income 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross margin selling  general  and administrative expense store pre opening costs litigation settlements operating income interest expense other income and expense  net income before income taxes  extraordinary loss  and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of accounting change extraordinary loss for early extinguishment of debt  net of income tax cumulative effect of accounting change for revenue recognition  net of income tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal fiscal net sales includes a rd week totaling million 
excluding the rd week of net sales in fiscal  net sales in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the results for fiscal included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from eight michaels store closures 
sales at the new stores  net of closures  accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
comparable store sales  on a week basis  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which contributed million to the net sales increase 
the improvement in comparable store sales was due to a strong performance in our core categories of seasonal products as well as general crafts  framing  art  and d cor accents 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was  a decrease of compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower fiscal seasonal inventory markdowns related to holiday clearance merchandise  partially offset by higher occupancy costs associated with new and relocated stores and higher utility costs 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million  or as a percentage of net sales  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce the valuation of certain merchandise that did not conform to each store s specific plan o gram sku program  which is expected to be liquidated at markdown prices in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal selling  general  and administrative expense includes one time costs of million related to senior executive severance 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior fiscal year 
on june   we negotiated a tentative settlement of the purported class action with one of our former assistant managers  taiyeb raniwala 
as a result  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on november  on march   aaron brothers negotiated a definitive settlement of the purported class action with suzanne collins  a former aaron brothers assistant manager  subject to final court approval 
as a result  aaron brothers recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
operating income increased by  as a percentage of net sales  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was negatively impacted by one time severance costs of million and litigation settlement charges totaling million 
excluding the effects of the one time severance charge and the litigation settlement charges  operating income increased from million  or of net sales  in fiscal to million  or of net sales  in fiscal interest expense  net of interest income  in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal fiscal expense includes non recurring incremental interest expense of million incurred while the senior notes due and the senior notes due were both outstanding for a day period during fiscal excluding the non recurring incremental interest  fiscal net interest expense was million  or of net sales 
in addition  interest expense increased due to the increased principal amount of the senior notes due compared to the senior notes due  interest on higher outstanding borrowings against the credit agreement  and lower average cash balances during fiscal these increases in net interest expense were partially offset by interest savings of million related to the conversion and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes in june on august   we redeemed our senior notes due in aggregate principal amount of million 
as a result  we recorded an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  net of income tax of million  in the third quarter of fiscal we changed our accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition related to the sale of custom frames effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change on fiscal years prior to fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal excluding the one time severance charges  litigation settlements  incremental interest  and extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for fiscal  excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting with respect to revenue recognition related to the sale of custom frames 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the results for fiscal included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened and a wholesale operation that was acquired during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from three michaels and one aaron brothers store closures 
sales at the new stores  net of closures  and the acquired wholesale operation during fiscal accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
comparable store sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which contributed million to the net sales increase 
in addition  fiscal net sales includes sales from the rd week of million 
the improvement in comparable store sales was due to a strong performance in our core categories of general crafts  ribbon  art supplies  framing  and floral as well as substantial increases in the seasonal product categories 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was  an increase of compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher fiscal seasonal inventory markdowns related to holiday clearance merchandise and higher occupancy costs associated with new and relocated stores 
selling  general  and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to improved expense leverage in advertising and depreciation and amortization expenses  partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses  as a percentage of net sales  and costs associated with our supply chain initiative totaling million 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior fiscal year 
operating income  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal operating income increased from fiscal to fiscal  on a increase in net sales  to million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense  net of interest income  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal this decrease resulted from interest savings related to the conversion and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes in june and a leveraging of interest expense on expanded sales 
we changed our accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition related to the sale of custom frames effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  we recorded a charge of million  net of income tax  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change on prior years 
net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal excluding the one time charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash and equivalents cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in income taxes payable  accrued liabilities and other  net income  and the extraordinary loss for early extinguishment of debt  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 
cash flow used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal cash flow from investment activities in fiscal includes capital expenditures related to the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores and the relocation of michaels and five aaron brothers stores during fiscal in addition  we received proceeds in the amount of million from the completion of a sale leaseback transaction in july for two distribution center properties which we purchased in december the gain from the sale leaseback transaction of million was deferred and will be amortized over the life of the sale leaseback contract  which is being accounted for as an operating lease 
the following table sets forth capital expenditures  net of the sale leaseback transaction proceeds discussed above fiscal year in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened   existing stores    distribution system expansion   information systems    corporate and other    proceeds from sale leaseback transaction  the increase in capital expenditures for existing stores was primarily due to fixture costs for plan o gram resets at the stores during the second and third quarters of fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal to total approximately million 
cash flow provided by financing activities in fiscal was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes due and a decrease from the acquisition of treasury stock totaling million in fiscal these cash flow increases were partially offset by the early redemption of the senior notes due and a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million for approximately million shares of our common stock in fiscal and million for approximately million shares of our common stock in fiscal bank credit facility effective may   we signed a new million unsecured revolving bank credit facility with fleet national bank and other lending institutions  which replaced the previous million unsecured revolving bank credit facility 
the credit agreement has a term of three years with a maturity extension for one additional year available under certain conditions and contains a million competitive bid feature and a million letter of credit sub facility 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  including a balance sheet leverage ratio  a cash flow coverage ratio  a cash flow leverage ratio  and a capital expenditure limitation 
interest on all borrowings varies based upon the type of borrowing  the fixed charge coverage ratio  and whether we elect to utilize the competitive bid feature available under the credit agreement 
if the competitive bid feature is not utilized  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement is generally a the higher of i an annual rate of interest announced from time to time by fleet national bank  as agent  as its base rate or ii one half of one percent above the federal funds effective rate or b the eurodollar rate  as defined by the credit agreement  plus an applicable margin based on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
if the competitive bid feature is utilized  loans up to million may be made under the credit agreement at competitively bid interest rates offered by lending institutions participating in the facility  which may have the effect of decreasing the amount of interest we would otherwise be obligated to pay on such borrowings 
we are required to pay a facility fee from to per annum on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit as well as letter of credit fees that vary depending on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of february  or under our previous million bank credit facility as of february  borrowings available under the credit agreement are reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement million as of february  
borrowings under the credit agreement and our previous million bank credit facility in fiscal were outstanding for days  with average outstanding borrowings of million and a weighted average interest rate of 
borrowings under our previous million bank credit facility in fiscal were outstanding for days  with average outstanding borrowings of million and a weighted average interest rate of 
equity on october   our board of directors declared a two for one common stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november   payable on november  an amount equal to the par value of shares issued in the split has been transferred from paid in capital to the common stock account 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
pursuant to this plan  in fiscal we repurchased and placed in treasury  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we retired all of our common stock held in treasury 
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal  through december   we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million average of per share and  as a result  we completed the july stock repurchase plan 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   we have repurchased and retired million shares under this plan at an average cost of per share 
we may be restricted by regulations of the securities and exchange commission from making future repurchases during certain time periods 
finally  under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  we can only repurchase shares if we maintain or comply with specified financial ratios and other covenants 
proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options have served as a source of cash for us  and we expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options and options to be granted under our stock option plans in the future 
for fiscal  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million 
during fiscal  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our new general stock option plan are required to be used to repurchase shares of our own common stock under our current stock repurchase plan  except where not permitted by law or there is a compelling need to use the proceeds for other corporate purposes 
in october  we began issuing our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  which provides owners of shares of our common stock with a convenient and economical means of purchasing our common stock 
during fiscal   and  we issued   and  shares  respectively  through the plan  generating   and  respectively  in new equity 
in october  we began issuing our common stock through our employees stock purchase plan  which provides our employees with a convenient and economical means of purchasing our common stock  and also provides us with an additional way to raise equity capital 
during fiscal   and  we issued   and  shares  respectively  through the plan  generating approximately million   and  respectively  in proceeds 
prior to october  shares for the employees stock purchase plan were acquired through open market purchases 
debt in july  we issued million in principal amount of the senior notes due in a private placement under securities and exchange commission rule a to a limited number of qualified institutional buyers 
the senior notes due are unsecured and interest thereon is payable semi annually on each january and july  beginning on january  in august  as required by the contract with the purchasers of the senior notes due  we made an offer to exchange all of the privately placed senior notes due for an equal principal amount of senior notes due  which are registered with the securities and exchange commission and have substantially identical terms 
as of october   all of the privately placed senior notes due were exchanged for registered senior notes due on august   we used a portion of the proceeds of the senior notes due offering described above to redeem our senior notes due  of which million aggregate principal amount was then outstanding 
the redemption price was  per  principal amount of the senior notes due  plus accrued interest to august  we incurred an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  net of income tax  in the third quarter of fiscal on june   we called for the redemption on june  of our convertible subordinated notes due january  the aggregate principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes outstanding was  the holders had the option to convert their convertible subordinated notes into shares of our common stock by june   at a price of per share  unadjusted for the recent stock split 
alternatively  holders could have their convertible subordinated notes redeemed on june  at a total redemption price of  per  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which includes a premium for early redemption and accrued interest 
as a result  a majority of the convertible subordinated notes was surrendered by the june  conversion date and was converted into  shares of our common stock  unadjusted for the recent stock split 
the remaining convertible subordinated notes were redeemed at a total redemption price of million on june  the loss from the redemption was not material 
general we require cash principally to finance capital investments  inventory for new stores  and for seasonal working capital needs 
we opened michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal  relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal  expanded one michaels store in fiscal  and acquired star wholesale in fiscal in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  borrowings under our credit agreement  and proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal we anticipate spending approximately million to open approximately new michaels and new aaron brothers stores  million for improvements in existing stores  million for new and existing distribution centers  million on information systems projects  million on corporate expansion  and million for various other capital investment activities 
we expect to spend on average approximately million to open a new michaels store  which includes million in net inventory and million of pre opening costs and  to open a new aaron brothers store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs 
we anticipate that our new michaels stores  as a group  will become profitable within the first months of operation of each store 
we believe that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  funds available under the credit agreement  and the net proceeds of the senior notes due  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and any stock repurchases  for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these financial statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on our informed judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of these policies 
as discussed below  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of these policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include merchandise inventories we value our inventories at michaels stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using a retail inventory method 
because we do not have perpetual inventory records for inventory in our michaels stores  we are required to perform complete physical inventories for a sample of stores at the end of each fiscal quarter to estimate ending inventories valued at retail for all michaels stores 
our sampling process is designed to count a representative number of stores and sample results are adjusted to eliminate bias such as that which might result from differing store sizes 
an actual physical count of merchandise is made by third party inventory counting service firms in substantially every store each fiscal year 
we believe our sampling process results in reasonable estimates of our retail inventory on hand at period end 
additionally  in determining our cost of goods sold and ending inventory at cost  we utilize a single pool of inventory for all our michaels stores inventories 
at this time  we have no formal plans to move to a single pool for each of our stores or departmental pools to determine cost of sales and ending inventory  however  we may do so in the future as further enhancements are made to our inventory systems in connection with our efforts to move toward having store level perpetual inventory capabilities 
finally  our success in managing our inventories is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns 
permanent markdowns are recorded in the period in which management determines that markdowns will need to be taken to sell certain merchandise 
again  markdowns are generally determined based on sample retail counts of the affected merchandise on hand and the amount of retail markdowns that will be required to sell the merchandise 
these markdowns are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through february   goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful life  and was tested periodically to determine if it was recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over its useful life 
effective in fiscal  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment of our goodwill  however  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not result should our operating results deteriorate for reasons such as those described under risk factors herein 
reserve for closed facilities we maintain a reserve for future rental obligations  carrying costs  and other closing costs related to closed facilities  primarily closed and relocated stores 
reserves for these charges are recorded when management has committed to closing or relocating a store and are calculated as the lesser of future rental obligations remaining under the lease less estimated sublease rental income or the lease termination fee 
the carrying values of long lived assets for stores identified for closure are depreciated at an accelerated rate until the store is closed 
our reserves for closed facilities totaled million at february  the determination of the reserves is dependent on our ability to make reasonable estimates of costs to be incurred post closure and of sublease rental income to be received from subleases 
the reserves could vary materially if market conditions were to vary significantly from our assumptions 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
for the last five fiscal years  our fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and approximately of our operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves implementation issues related to sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the provisions of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal would have resulted in an increase in net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal we will perform the first required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first six months of fiscal and have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be 
however  we believe the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
and no 
will not have a materially adverse impact on our operating results or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes accounting treatment for certain types of hedging activities 
we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
beginning in fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position in fiscal risk factors our growth depends on our ability to open new stores our key business strategy is to expand our base of michaels and aaron brothers stores 
if we were unable to implement this strategy  our ability to increase our sales  profitability  and cash flow could be impaired significantly 
to the extent that we are unable to open new stores as we anticipate  our sales growth would come only from increases in comparable store sales 
growth in profitability in that case would depend significantly on our ability to reduce our costs as a percentage of our sales 
we may be unable to implement our strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional stores  negotiate acceptable leases  access sufficient capital to support store growth  or hire and train a sufficient number of qualified associates 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  our key business strategy of expanding our store base  we may experience problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow 
for example the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores  the closure of unsuccessful stores may result in the retention of liability for expensive leases  a significant portion of our management s time and energy may be consumed with issues unrelated to advancing our core business strategy which could possibly result in a deterioration of our operating results  our expansion may outpace our planned technological advances with the possible consequences of breakdowns in our supply chain management and reduced effectiveness of our operational controls  we may be unable to hire and train qualified managers and other associates  our suppliers may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner  and we may be unable to expand our existing distribution centers or employ third party distribution on a cost effective basis to provide merchandise for sale by our new stores 
we may fail to anticipate customer demands our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which would have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow 
conversely  shortages of key items could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
our suppliers may fail us many of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items 
given their limited resources  these firms are susceptible to cash flow issues  production difficulties  quality control issues  and problems in delivering agreed upon quantities on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we would be able  if necessary  to return product to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective 
in addition  these suppliers may be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions 
significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
in addition  many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  exposing us to shifts in demand 
risks relating to foreign suppliers we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers of various products that we sell 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
this reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political or economic conditions  transportation delays  restrictive actions by foreign governments  or united states laws and regulations affecting imports 
reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for various reasons 
all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states are subject to duties collected by the united states customs service 
we may be subjected to additional duties  significant monetary penalties  the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import  or the loss of the import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of us laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products 
our information systems may prove inadequate we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
we will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve  upgrade and expand our systems  particularly in light of our planned significant increases in number of stores 
in addition  we are in the process of upgrading our information systems to provide us with perpetual inventory and automated replenishment capabilities  which we believe are extremely important in the management of a chain of hundreds of stores offering tens of thousands of skus 
delays in bringing these new capabilities on line  or disruptions from an imperfect introduction of these new capabilities  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results our business is highly seasonal 
our inventories and short term borrowings grow in the second and third fiscal quarters as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our most important quarter in terms of sales  profitability  and cash flow historically has been the fourth fiscal quarter 
if for any reason our fourth fiscal quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected  and we could have substantial excess inventory  especially in seasonal merchandise that is difficult to liquidate 
improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain  including merchandise ordering  transportation  and receipt processing 
failure to take advantage of supply chain opportunities could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
competition could negatively impact our operations the retail arts and crafts industry is competitive  which could result in the reduction of our prices and our loss of market share 
we must remain competitive in the areas of quality  price  selection  and convenience 
our primary competition is comprised of specialty arts and crafts retailers  which include hobby lobby  ac moore arts crafts  inc  jo ann etc 
operated by jo ann stores  inc and garden ridge corporation 
we also compete with mass merchants  who dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise  regional chains  and local merchants 
some of our competitors  particularly the mass merchants  are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  alternative methods of selling crafts  such as over the internet  could result in additional competitors in the future and increased price competition since our customers could more readily comparison shop 
furthermore  we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers 
the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions our needs for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including our results of operations and efforts to expand our existing operations 
we believe  based on current circumstances  that our cash flow  together with available borrowing under our bank credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to repay our debt as it becomes due and make necessary investments  we may be required to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  seek new borrowings  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional equity capital  or delay  scale back  or eliminate some aspects of our operations  including delaying our plans for new store openings 
moreover  it is possible that we may not be able to satisfy all of the conditions and covenants of our debt 
in addition  to the extent we seek to replace or refinance our current debt  replacement financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain acceptable financing upon the expiration of our bank credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing will be significantly impacted by  among other things  any changes in the ratings assigned to us by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
any of these events  if they were to occur  could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the covenant restrictions in our debt restrict our operations we and our subsidiaries are subject to significant operating and financial restrictions contained in the instruments governing the senior notes due and our other indebtedness 
those restrictions affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make various investments  issue or sell our restricted subsidiaries capital stock  engage in transactions with affiliates  make various distributions  sell or securitize accounts receivables  provide negative pledges  make capital expenditures beyond specific limitations  engage in derivative transactions other than in the ordinary course of business  create various liens  or merge  consolidate  and sell assets 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or conduct necessary corporate activities 
if we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with these restrictions  we may be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  even if we are otherwise able to meet our debt service obligations 
in the event of a default  the holders of the indebtedness could elect to declare all of that indebtedness  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable and a significant portion of our other indebtedness may become immediately due and payable as a result of cross default clauses contained in documentation evidencing debt 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments 
even if we were to obtain additional financing  that financing may be in terms unfavorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money market mutual funds and short term interest bearing securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at february  approximated carrying value 
the interest rates on our revolving line of credit are repriced frequently  at market rates  which would result in carrying amounts that approximate fair value 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at february  we believe that the affect  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
the fair value of our senior notes due was estimated to be million at february   which was million greater than carrying value 
generally  the fair value of our fixed interest rate long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates used by the dealers to quote the fair value of our long term debt at february   which would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at february   by year of maturity dollars in thousands fiscal year thereafter long term debt  weighted average interest rate
