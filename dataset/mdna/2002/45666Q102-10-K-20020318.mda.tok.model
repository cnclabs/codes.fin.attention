the results of operations of informatica partners have been included in our results of operations since the acquisition date 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and services 
our license revenues are derived from our enterprise analytic software  which consists of data integration  analytics delivery and  to a lesser extent  analytic applications products 
we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts and training and consulting services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly from us or indirectly through resellers  distributors and oems 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenues when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price is established by our authorized management 
if an acceptance period is required  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
for the data integration and analytics delivery products to end users  we recognize revenue upon shipment and when collectibility is probable 

table of contents for our analytic applications  we recognize the bundled license and maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance period  generally one year 
support for the analytic applications for the first year is never sold separately and in consideration of the complexities of the implementation the customer is entitled to receive support services that are different than the standard annual support services 
we also enter into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically provide for sublicense or end user license fees based on a percentage of list prices 
based on limited credit history  for sales to oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers  we recognize revenue at the time payment is received for our products  rather than at the time of sale 
our standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
we recognize maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product enhancements performed on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements related to the installation and implementation of our software products 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at our headquarters  sales offices and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software or cash collections  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software and the payment terms for licenses are not dependent on additional acceptance criteria 
deferred revenue includes deferred license and maintenance revenue and prepaid training and consulting fees 
deferred revenue amounts do not include items which are both deferred and unbilled 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer revenue until payment is received 

table of contents the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative merger related costs amortization of stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets purchased in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations interest income and other  net interest expense loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss cost of license revenues  as a percentage of license revenues cost of service revenues  as a percentage of service revenues years ended december   and revenues our total revenues increased to million in  from million in and million in  representing growth of from to and from to our license revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of from to and from to these increases were due primarily to increases in the number of licenses sold and the average transaction size  primarily reflecting increased acceptance of our data integration products and  to a lesser extent  our analytic application products as well as expansion of our direct sales organization and reseller channels 
service revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of from to and from to these increases were due primarily to an increase in consulting  training and maintenance fees associated with both the increased number of licenses sold and the increased average transaction size  along with a larger installed license base in each successive year 
our future prospects and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by our ability to successfully license our data integration products and our analytic application products 
in particular  we recently released our new analytic delivery platform and new versions of our analytic applications  and the degree of market acceptance for these products is currently uncertain 
if we are not able to successfully license our products and  in particular  our analytic applications  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
see risk factors because we sell a limited number of products  if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues will be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in particular  our product revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
in addition  we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter 
these factors particularly affect the first quarter of our fiscal year 
see risk factors the expected fluctuation of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
our international revenues increased to million in  from million in and million in  representing growth from to and from to the increase in was due primarily to expansion throughout europe  asia pacific and japan with increased sales being generated by direct sales  increased volume through existing distributors and new distributors added during the year 
growth in was primarily driven by increased sales activities in the united kingdom and germany

cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in and was approximately of license revenues in and of license revenues in and the increase in absolute dollar amount in was due primarily to increases in our percentage mix of royalty bearing products 
for  we expect the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to remain at or slightly above the level

operating expenses research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance and development of documentation for our products 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in the increase in each of these periods was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs in each such period for development of future products and enhancement of existing products 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in the increase from to as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to our continued investment in product development to expand our product portfolio and increased facilities costs 
the decrease from to was primarily due to faster growth in total revenues compared to research and development expenses 
to date  all software and development costs have been expensed in the period incurred because costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
for  we expect research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues will remain at or slightly below the level 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  seminars  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows

as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in  in and in the increase as a percentage of total revenue from to was due primarily to increased sales and marketing personnel costs and increased commission expense associated with increased revenue growth 
the decrease as a percentage of total revenue from to was due primarily to faster growth in total revenues compared to sales and marketing expenses

general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in and expenses increased in each period due primarily to increased staffing in finance  human resources  legal  information technology and administration to manage and support our growth as well as increased costs paid to outside professional service providers and increased facilities costs

in  we recorded a reduction for deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with a cancelled bonus agreement related to cancelled stock options 
deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
amortization of stock based compensation amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect to record amortization of stock based compensation of approximately million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets we have acquired 
intangible assets include core technology  acquired workforce and patents

amortization expense associated with this acquisition was million in and million in in june  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas and sfas establish new standards for accounting for goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas requires recognition of goodwill as an asset  but sfas mandates that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized after december under the new standards  these assets will be subject to annual impairment tests using a fair value based approach in accordance with sfas the change from an amortization approach to an impairment approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as well as goodwill and other intangible assets arising from acquisitions completed after june  intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas is expected to result in a decrease in amortization of goodwill of million in we performed the first of the required impairment tests as of january  based on current market conditions  we believe the adoption of sfas on january  will not result in a material write down of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
the application of the provisions of sfas will result in a reclassification of million of intangible assets as goodwill in the first quarter of for the other intangible assets that we will continue to amortize  we expect amortization expense to be approximately million for it is likely that we will continue to expand our business both through acquisitions and internal development 
any additional acquisitions or impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles could result in additional merger and acquisition related expenses 
purchased in process research and development in connection with our strategic alliance with pwc and the acquisitions of zimba and qrb developers  we recorded charges to operations of million  million and million  respectively  for purchased in process research and development in the in process technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process research and development in each transaction was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of future revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies acquired and determined by an independent third party 

table of contents restructuring charges in july  we announced our plan to consolidate our four san francisco bay area locations into the new facility in redwood city 
as a result of the consolidation of these facilities  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million during the third quarter of for excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas and the related write offs of property and equipment 
we recorded a restructuring charge in of approximately million related to the excess leased facilities 
these costs include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees reduced by estimated sublease income over the estimated sublease period or the remaining lease terms through the estimated costs of excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease  were based on market information and trend analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm 
actual future cash requirements will differ from the restructuring liability balances at december   if we are unable to sublease the excess leased facilities or actual sublease income is different from estimates 
property and equipment from these facilities that was removed from operations resulted in a charge of million in and consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
interest income and other  net  interest expense interest income and other  net represents primarily interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash 
interest income and other  net increased to million in  from million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to an increased average cash balance as a result of the completion of our follow on public offering of our common stock with net proceeds of million in october the increase was primarily due to an increased average cash balance as a result of the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock in april  with net proceeds of million 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and represents interest expense on capital equipment leases and stockholder loans 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in  million in and million in  due primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 
the income tax provision decreased in from because of the ability of the increased losses to absorb non deductible expenses and deferred tax items that effected the alternative minimum tax calculation 
the income tax provision primarily increased in from due to the impact to the federal alternative minimum tax calculation for non deductible expenses and deferred tax items  for which a valuation allowance was recorded  and increased foreign taxes 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and foreign tax credits of million 
our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
our deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following areas are some of the more critical judgments areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sop we recognize license revenues when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
the determination regarding the probability of collection is based on management s judgment 
if changes in conditions cause management to determine that this criteria is not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

table of contents allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for sales returns on revenue in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates require management judgment and are based on historical sales returns and other known factors 
if these estimates do not adequately reflect future sales returns  revenue could be overstated 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  based on current market conditions  we believe the adoption of sfas on january  will not result in a material write down of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
restructuring during  we recorded significant liabilities in connection with our restructuring program 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions quarterly to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
if we determined that our estimates for sublease activities has significantly changed  an adjustment to the restructuring liability would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  however  if it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in addition to sfas and sfas discussed above  other recent accounting pronouncements include sfas sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which we adopted on january  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities 
because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supersedes fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles board opinion  reporting the results of operations 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangibles  to be disposed of and addresses significant implementation issues 
we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock 
in the past  we also funded our operations through private sales of preferred equity securities and capital equipment leases 
as of december 
table of contents   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
we also had million of cash restricted under the terms of our pacific shores property leases 
our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million for the operating cash inflows were primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accrued compensation and related expenses  restructuring charges and deferred revenue and were partially offset by the net loss offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and income taxes payable 
our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million for and million for the sources of cash in both periods resulted principally from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  accrued compensation and related expenses  and deferred revenue 
the uses of cash in resulted principally from increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and other assets and were partially offset by the net loss offset by non cash charges for sales and return allowances  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  and purchased in process research and development 
the uses of cash in resulted principally from increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets and were partially offset by the net loss offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets

financing activities provided cash of million for  consisting principally of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million for  primarily from the net proceeds of our secondary offering of million as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by final payments on notes payable to stockholders associated with the acquisition of influence in december the source of cash of million for was primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public offering of million 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases 
our future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  were as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for new corporate headquarters in redwood city  california 
we began occupying the new corporate headquarters in august the lease expires in twelve years  or august we paid for tenant improvements  primarily related to the exercise of build to suit options under the facility lease agreement 
the total estimated cost of leasehold improvements for this facility through its completion is approximately million  which is subject to change 
total expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment for this facility are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million has been expended on these activities through december  with the balance expected to be incurred by june as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for the first year s lease payments until certain financial covenants are met 
these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
in february  we entered into a fourteen month lease agreement in palo alto  california covering approximately  square feet of space at approximately  per month to meet our space requirements until the new facility in redwood city  california was completed in august the remaining obligations under this lease agreement were included in the restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the four san francisco bay area locations into the redwood city facility 
deferred revenue includes deferred license and maintenance revenue and prepaid training and consulting fees 
deferred license revenue amounts do not include items which are both deferred and unbilled 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer 
table of contents revenue until payment is received 
as of december   we had million of sales related to shipments to specific international customers  specific resellers and oems  based on limited credit history  for which revenue had not been recognized 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a decrease in customer demand or the acceptance of our products  our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations may be jeopardized 
as a result  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any financing we obtain may dilute your ownership interests 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this form k 
the expected fluctuation of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to also significantly fluctuate or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the size and timing of customer orders  which can be affected by customer order deferrals in anticipation of future new product introductions or product enhancements and customer budgeting and purchasing cycles  market acceptance of our products  the length and variability of our sales cycle for our products  particularly our analytic applications and our new analytic delivery platform  general economic and political conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment and information technology spending levels  and the mix of our products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels utilized  announcement  introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products and changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  technological changes in computer systems and environments  increased competition from partnerships formed by our current and former partners and our competitors 

table of contents our product revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter 
if customers cancel or delay orders it can have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations for the quarter 
to the extent any such cancellations or delays are for large orders  this impact will be greater 
to the extent that the average size of our orders increases  customers cancellations or delays of orders will more likely harm our revenues and results of operations 
our quarterly product license revenues are difficult to forecast because we do not have a substantial backlog of orders  and therefore revenues in each quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and cash collections from specific international customers and specific resellers 
our product license revenues are also difficult to forecast because the market for our products is rapidly evolving  and our sales cycles  which may last many months  vary substantially from customer to customer and vary in general due to a number of factors  some of which we have little or no control  such as size and timing of individual license transactions  the closing of which tend to be delayed by customers until the end of a fiscal quarter as a negotiating tactic  potential for delay or deferral of customer implementations of our software  changes in customer budgets  seasonality of technology purchases direct sales force effort to meet or exceed year end quotas  lower european sales during the summer months  and other general economic conditions 
nonetheless  our short term expense levels are relatively fixed and based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
the difficulty we have in predicting our quarterly revenue means revenues shortfalls are likely to occur at some time  and our inability to adequately reduce short term expenses means such shortfalls will affect not only our revenue  but also our overall business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
you should not take our quarterly results to be indicative of our future performance 
moreover  our future operating results may fall below the expectations of stock analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock may fall 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions 
because of the present economic slowdown in the united states and in europe  and the terrorist events of september  companies in many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
we experienced the impact of the september events in the third quarter and the economic slowdown in the past few quarters with reductions in capital expenditures by our end user customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased price competition 
in particular  these factors have negatively impacted the rate of market acceptance of our analytic applications 
as a result  if the current economic conditions in the us and europe continue or worsen  or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may continue to fall short of our revenue expectations for the first quarter of and any given quarter of or for the entire year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our reseller customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which would harm our financial condition 
the lengthy sales cycle and implementation process of our products makes our revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales cycle can be lengthy because the expense  complexity  broad functionality and company wide deployment of our products  particularly our analytic applications  typically require executive level approval from our customers before they can purchase our products 
in addition  to successfully sell our products  we frequently must educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our products  which also can require significant time 
due to these factors  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of budget cycles  concerns about the introduction of our products or competitors new products  or potential downturns in general economic or political conditions 

table of contents further  our sales cycle may lengthen as we continue to focus our sales efforts on large corporations and focus on sales of our analytic applications 
the implementation of our products  particularly our analytic applications  can be a complex and time consuming process  the length and cost of which may be difficult to predict 
if our sales cycle and implementation process lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs  either of which may independently cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 
if the market in which we sell our products and services does not grow as we anticipate  it will adversely affect our revenues 
the market for software solutions  including enterprise analytic software  that enable more effective business decision making by helping companies aggregate and utilize data stored throughout an organization  is relatively new and still emerging 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the sale of products and services in this market 
if this market does not grow at the rate we anticipate  we will not be able to sell as much of our software products and services  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
one of the reasons this market might not grow as we anticipate is that many companies are not yet fully aware of the benefits of using these software solutions to help make business decisions or the benefits of our specific product solutions 
as a result  we believe that only a limited number of large companies have deployed these software solutions 
although we have devoted and intend to continue to devote significant resources promoting market awareness of the benefits of these solutions  our efforts may be unsuccessful or insufficient 
the higher fees for  and potentially longer sales cycle of  our analytic applications could be especially affected by a global economic slowdown  where larger transaction sizes receive closer scrutiny by our potential customers 
because we sell a limited number of products  if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues will be adversely affected 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from our powercenter  powermart  powerconnect and related services  and to a lesser extent  our analytic applications and related services 
we expect revenues derived from these products and related services to comprise substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
even if the emerging software market in which these products are sold grows substantially  if any of these products do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues could decrease 
in particular  we recently released our new analytic delivery platform and new versions of our analytic applications  and the degree of market acceptance for these products is currently uncertain 
market acceptance of our products could be affected if  among other things  competition substantially increases in the enterprise analytic software marketplace or transactional applications suppliers integrate their products to such a degree that the utility of the data integration functionality that our products provide is minimized or rendered unnecessary 
if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  it may harm our business or results of operations 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the date when they estimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare the pipeline at various points in time to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis may provide us with some guidance in business planning and budgeting  these pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
any change in the conversion of the pipeline into customer sales or in the pipeline itself could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business or results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in the economy may cause customer purchases to be reduced in amount  deferred or cancelled  which will therefore reduce the overall license pipeline conversion rates in a particular period of time 
recent terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc on september  disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
in response to such attacks  the united states is actively using military force to pursue those behind these attacks and initiating broader actions against global terrorism 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and europe  the escalation of military action and heightened security measures in response to such further threats may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in further reductions in capital expenditures or spending on 
table of contents information technology  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of customer orders  or an inability to effectively market our products  our revenues would decline  which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we intend to continue to license technologies from third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technologies  which are integrated into our products and services 
if we cannot obtain  integrate or continue to license any of these technologies  we may experience a delay in product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
these technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our products or services  which would harm our business and operating results 
third party licenses also expose us to increased risks that include risks of product malfunction after new technology is integrated  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
the market in which we sell our products is highly competitive 
the market for our products is highly competitive  quickly evolving and subject to rapidly changing technology 
many of our competitors or potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
we believe we currently compete more on the basis of our products functionality than on the basis of price 
if our competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality  we may have difficulty competing on the basis of price 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  either of which could harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we compete principally against providers of data warehousing and analytic applications 
such competitors include acta technology  ascential software corporation  broadbase software  inc  e 
piphany inc 
and sagent technology  inc 
in addition  we compete against business intelligence vendors  database vendors and enterprise application vendors that currently offer  or may develop  products with functionalities that compete with our solutions  such as brio technology  inc  business objects  cognos inc  hyperion solutions corporation and microstrategy inc the products offered by database vendors typically operate specifically with these competitors proprietary databases 
such potential competitors include ibm  microsoft  oracle  peoplesoft  sap and siebel systems 
if we do not maintain and strengthen our relationships with our strategic partners  our ability to generate revenue and control implementation costs will be adversely affected 
we believe that our ability to increase the sales of our products and our future success will depend in part upon maintaining and strengthening successful relationships with our current or future strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on established relationships with a variety of strategic partners  such as systems integrators  resellers and distributors  for marketing  licensing  implementing and supporting our products in the united states and internationally 
we also rely on relationships with strategic technology partners  such as enterprise resource planning providers and enterprise application providers  for the promotion and implementation of our solutions 
in particular  our ability to market our products depends substantially on our relationships with significant strategic partners  including accenture  bea systems  deloitte consulting  hewlett packard  i technologies  ibm  kpmg consulting  mitsubishi 
table of contents electric  peoplesoft  pwc consulting  siebel systems and sybase 
in addition  our strategic partners may offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic partnerships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who are able to market our products effectively  who are qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service or who have the technical expertise and personnel resources necessary to implement our products for our customers 
in particular  if our strategic partners do not devote adequate resources for implementation of our products  we will incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to timely implement solutions for our customers 
furthermore  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop these relationships 
any significant defect in our products could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to product liability claims 
the software products we offer are inherently complex and despite extensive testing and quality control  have in the past and may in the future contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced 
these defects and errors could cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  product returns  order cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our products  and as a result  harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix these defects or errors 
for example  we issued corrective releases to fix problems with the version of our powermart released in the first quarter of as a result  we had to allocate significant customer support resources to address these problems 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements  however  may not be effective as a result of existing or future national  federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise wide environments 
if a claimant successfully brings a product liability claim against us  it would likely significantly harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
technological advances and evolving industry standards could adversely impact our future product sales 
the market for our products is characterized by continuing technological development  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products by our direct competitors or others embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
in particular  an industry wide adoption of uniform open standards across heterogeneous applications could minimize the importance of the integration functionality of our products and materially adversely affect the competitiveness and market acceptance of our products 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing customer requirements and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological and competitive developments and emerging industry standards 
we have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
as a result  some of our customers deferred purchasing the powermart product until the next upgrade was released 
future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect seasonal trends to cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate 
in recent years  there has been a relatively greater demand for our products in the fourth quarter than in each of the first three quarters of the year  particularly the first quarter 
as a result  we historically have experienced relatively higher bookings in the fourth quarter and relatively lighter bookings in the first quarter  which is a lighter quarter and often experiences less growth than other quarters 
we believe that these fluctuations are caused by customer buying patterns often influenced by year end budgetary pressures and the efforts of our direct sales force to meet or exceed year end sales quotas 
in addition  european sales tend to be relatively lower during the summer months than during other periods 
due to the economic slowdown in  our quarterly revenues may not be indicative of seasonal trends that were experienced in prior years 
with economic recovery  we expect that seasonal trends may continue in the foreseeable future 
this seasonal impact may increase as we continue to focus our sales efforts on large corporations 

table of contents we recognize revenue from specific customers at the time we receive payment for our products  and if these customers do not make timely payment  our revenues could decrease 
based on limited credit history  we recognize revenue from sales to oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers at the time we receive payment for our products  rather than at the time of sale 
if these customers do not make timely payment for our products  our revenues could decrease 
if our revenues decrease  the price of our common stock may fall 
we have a limited operating history and a history of losses  and we may not be able to achieve profitable operations 
we were incorporated in and began selling our products in  and therefore  we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our operations  products and prospects 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception  and we may not achieve profitability 
we intend to increase our operating expenses in the next twelve months  therefore  our operating results will be harmed if revenues do not increase 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders  or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  related businesses  products or technologies 
future acquisitions could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities 
there can be no assurance that any strategic acquisition or investment will succeed 
any future acquisition or investment could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  collections  exchange rate fluctuations  regulatory and other risks  which could limit our future growth 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations  and as a result  we may face significant additional risks 
our failure to manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
our international operations face numerous risks 
our products must be localized customized to meet local user needs in order to be sold in particular foreign countries 
developing local versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult and can take longer than we anticipate 
we currently have limited experience in localizing products and in testing whether these localized products will be accepted in the targeted countries 
we cannot assure you that our localization efforts will be successful 
in addition  we have only a limited history of marketing  selling and supporting our products and services internationally 
as a result  we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations 
however  we may experience difficulties in recruiting and training an international staff 
we must also be able to enter into strategic relationships with companies in international markets 
if we are not able to maintain successful strategic relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic relationships  our future growth could be limited 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including the following greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  longer collection cycles  potential unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  potential unexpected changes in tax laws and treaties  
table of contents sales seasonality  the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
we may encounter difficulties predicting the extent of the future impact of these conditions 
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and  consequently  materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are not able to adequately protect our propriety rights  our business could be harmed 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our pending patent applications may not be allowed or our competitors may successfully challenge the validity or scope of any of our five issued patents or any future issued patents 
our patents alone may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage 
third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
we cannot easily monitor any unauthorized use of our products  and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry in general 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in various foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may be inadequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as is common in the software industry  we have received and may continue from time to time to receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other proprietary rights 
third parties could claim that our current or future products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could adversely effect our business  financial condition and operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
legal action claiming patent infringement could be commenced against us  and we may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
moreover  the cost of defending patent litigation could be substantial  regardless of the outcome 
in the event a patent claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and operating results would be significantly harmed 
our business could suffer as a result of our strategic acquisitions and investments 
in december  we acquired influence  a developer of analytic applications 
in february  we acquired delphi  a distributor of our products in switzerland 
in august  we acquired zimba  a provider of applications that enable mobile professionals to have real time access to enterprise and external information through wireless devices  voice recognition technologies and the internet 
in april  we acquired certain pwc intellectual property rights and personnel 
in november  we acquired certain intellectual property from qrb developers 
in january  we acquired syn t sys  a distributor of our products in the netherlands and belgium 
in june  we acquired informatica partners  a distributor of our products in france 
we may not be able to effectively integrate these companies  intellectual property  or personnel  and our attempts to do so will place an additional burden on our management and infrastructure 
these acquisitions will subject us to a number of risks  including the loss of key personnel  customers and business relationships  difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating the new personnel and operations of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the expense associated with maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients  
table of contents the risk of product malfunction after new technology is integrated  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs  and the risk of impairment write offs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions 
our stock price fluctuates as a result of factors other than our operating results 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including our operating results and the following the announcement of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  changes in recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported class action complaint  which has been filed on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock between april  and december  the complaint seeks unspecified damages from alleged violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of see item legal proceedings 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which may impact our operations 
difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could harm our results of operations 
in the past  we have experienced a period of rapid and substantial growth that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and  if such growth resumes  will continue to place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our business  results of operations or financial condition may be significantly harmed 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our sales  operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and hiring programs 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our sales  management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
we are currently in the process of implementing improvements to our control systems and have licensed technology from a third party to accomplish this objective 
we may experience difficulties in the implementation process or in connection with the third party software which could divert our resources  including attention of management 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel  particularly in the silicon valley area  where we are headquartered  could harm our results of operations 
we believe our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including gaurav s 
dhillon  our chief executive officer  diaz h 
nesamoney  our president and chief operating officer  and other key members of our management 
table of contents team 
we currently do not have any key man life insurance relating to our key personnel  and their employment is at will and not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining key personnel in the future 
as we seek to expand our operations  the hiring of qualified sales and technical personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees  particularly in the silicon valley area  where we are headquartered  is intense 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and technical personnel 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel  would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  which may not be available on reasonable terms to us  if at all 
we may not generate sufficient revenue from operations to offset our operating or other expenses 
as a result  in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to borrow money or sell more of our equity securities to meet our cash needs 
even if we are able to do so  it may not be on terms that are favorable or reasonable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional capital when we need it in the future  our business could be seriously harmed 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of informatica or a change in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of november  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have a classified board of directors  with each class of directors subject to re election every three years 
this classified board has the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to insert their representatives on our board of directors and gain control of informatica 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power which occurred during in the event these blackouts are reinstated  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity may continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could in turn hurt our profitability 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors interest rate risk 
table of contents our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  government notes and bonds  corporate bonds and municipal securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material interest rate risk exposure 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we also have relationships with distributors in various regions  including asia pacific  australia  europe  japan and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as our sales are primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we translate foreign currencies into u 
s dollars for reporting purposes and currency fluctuations may have a quarterly impact on our financial results 
to date  we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
