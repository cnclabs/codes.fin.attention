comparison of years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended were million  a decrease of million or compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily a result of million in lower software licensing revenue 
the decrease in software licensing revenue was primarily related to the company s factorylink r product  partially offset by a increase in software licensing of xfactory r during the company believed that the decrease in software licensing revenues was primarily due to a major industry wide decline in the first quarter of although the market did not deteriorate further throughout the remainder of  it did not recover to the same levels the company experienced in additionally  while factorylink r was released on june   it was substantially later than originally planned and adversely affected revenues during selling and product materials expenses decreased million from million in to million for the same period in the company attributes the decrease to its cost reduction efforts under the revised operating plan developed to restructure and stabilize the business

the company capitalized million net of a write off of million and million of software development costs for the year ended december  and  respectively  primarily related to the next major version of the factorylink r product line 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million in to million for the same period in the increase is primarily due to incremental consulting fees associated with refining the company s longer term business plan

for the year ended december   loss from discontinued operations was million compared to million for the same period in the primary elements of the increase in loss from discontinued operations are set forth below 
total revenues for emake were million for the year ended compared to million for the period ended december  the decrease is primarily related to the market adoption rate of the technology around emake s products and services not progressing as quickly as anticipated 
selling and product materials  product development and general and administrative expenses for the discontinued operation increased million  million and million  respectively  compared to the same period in the increases are primarily attributable to incremental expenses associated with developing technology  building the infrastructure  start up and launching of emake 
during the year  the company implemented a restructuring plan designed to reduce emake s cost structure by reducing its workforce and other operating expenses 
the company recorded a charge for emake of million primarily consisting of employee severance and other employee related costs of million 
the reduction in workforce included approximately employees and affected all functions of emake 
other charges included in the million are early lease termination and facility shutdown costs of thousand  write downs of redundant property and equipment of thousand  lease costs associated with vacated office space in post falls  idaho of thousand and thousand for legal and other related costs

these intangible assets were deemed to be impaired due to the smart shop element of emake being significantly curtailed as a result of the revised operating plan 
the asset impairment charge includes a write off of goodwill and intangible assets of million  net and million  net  respectively 
also included in the impairment charge are capitalized website development costs and capitalized software costs of million  net and thousand  net  respectively 
these costs were deemed to be impaired due to the curtailment of the emake portal project as a result of the revised operating plan 
critical accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with the company s most critical accounting polices  namely the company s accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
significant estimates and assumptions management of the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities in preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  the determination of the recoverability of property and equipment  capitalized software development costs  software held for resale  and valuation of deferred tax asset 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers a number of factors  including the aging of the receivable portfolio  customer payment trends  financial condition of the customer  economic conditions in the customer s country and industry conditions 
for the three years ended december   the company did not experience significant charges to bad debt expense  however  due to the general weakening of the economy during and into  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
actual amounts could differ significantly from management s estimates 
the company assesses the recoverability of property and equipment  capitalized software development costs and software held for resale by determining the estimated future cash flows related to such assets 
the company reviews these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
management s estimates of future cash flows are based in part upon prior performance  industry conditions  economic conditions  technology trends and customer relationships 
changes in these factors or other factors could result in significantly different cash flow estimates and an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   as a result of strategy changes from two of the company s suppliers  the company determined that the carrying amount of capitalized software development costs related to two of its software products were not recoverable and as a result were deemed to be impaired 
due to this impairment  the company wrote off thousand related to its analyzer software product and thousand related to its connector software product  totaling thousand  in the third quarter of in addition  due to a revised operating plan of the company s subsidiary emake  certain business activities were abandoned or curtailed that required significant operating and capital expenditures during and during  based on the forecasted undiscounted cash flows from the revised operating plan  the company deemed that the acquired intangible assets were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge of million  which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended these intangible assets were deemed to be impaired due to the smart shop element of emake being significantly curtailed as a result of the revised operating plan 
the asset impairment charge includes a write off of goodwill and intangible assets of million  net and million  net  respectively 
also included in the impairment charge are capitalized website development costs and capitalized software costs of million  net  and thousand  net  respectively 
these costs were deemed to be impaired due to the curtailment of the emake portal project as a result of the revised operating plan 
in assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  management has fully reserved all deferred tax assets to the extent such assets exceed deferred tax liabilities 
revenue recognition the company earns revenue primarily from license fees  maintenance fees and professional services sold through direct sales or through its channel partners 
the license arrangements  do not provide for a right of return  and are primarily non transferable and non exclusive perpetual licenses 
the company offers two types of maintenance fees one that provides the customer the right to telephone support and to receive error and bug fix releases and one that provides upgrade version releases of the product during the maintenance term 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and generally recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
each of the four criteria above is defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and the company or  in situations where a contract is not required  a customer purchase order has been received 
delivery has occurred 
the company s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon the delivery of the electronic code or the shipment of the physical product based on standard contractual committed shipping terms  whereby risk of loss passes to customer when shipment is picked up by the carrier 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered as described above 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
the company s customers generally pay a per license fee that is based on the number of servers on which the software is installed  the size of the application that they will develop for the software  the options provided for those servers  and the number of client workstations that access with the server 
additional license fees are due when the total number of subscribers using the company s products increases beyond the specified number for which a license was purchased or when additional options are added 
license fees are generally due within days from product delivery in the united states and within days from product delivery internationally 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
the company typically sell to customers with high credit ratings and solid payment practices 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  in which the company evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized as cash payments are received 
the company allocates revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to maintenance and support services and professional service components of its license arrangements 
the company sells its professional services separately  and has established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for maintenance and support services is based on the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from licenses is recognized on delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the respective term 
professional services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
the company s software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these professional services to facilitate the adoption of the company s technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are typically billed separately and independently from professional services  which are generally billed either on a time and materials or a milestone achieved basis 
the company generally recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
capitalized software development software development costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in product development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility  and purchased software costs  are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis when the product is available for general release to customers 
the company establishes technological feasibility when it has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to determine that the final product meets its design specifications  specifically when the company has completed a detail program design and is ready to begin coding 
annual amortization  which is charged to selling and product materials  is the greater of i the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or ii the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
the company amortizes capitalized software development and purchased software costs using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  generally three years

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs

statement no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to its variable rate bank note payable of thousand and its revolving line of credit of million 
interest rate risk is estimated as the potential impact on the company s results of operations or financial position due to a hypothetical change of basis points in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
foreign operations comprised approximately of the company s sales 
the company primarily invoices and collects in us dollars 
risk resulting from foreign currency exposure is therefore minimal
