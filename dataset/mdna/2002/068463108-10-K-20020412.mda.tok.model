item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues consist of staffing services and professional employer organization peo services 
staffing services revenues consist of short term staffing  contract staffing and on site management 
peo services refer exclusively to co employer contractual agreements with peo clients 
the company s revenues represent all amounts invoiced to customers for direct payroll  related employment taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
the company s oregon and california offices accounted for approximately of its total revenues in consequently  weakness in economic conditions in these regions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company s cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs  payroll taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation  which includes safety incentives 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with the company s self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state and federal administrative agency fees and reinsurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
the company also maintains separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where the company is not self insured 
safety incentives  a component of workers compensation expense  represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
management believes that the company s operational policies and internal claims reporting system minimizes the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive bonuses 
part ii amortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of the costs of acquisitions in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill 
the company uses a year estimate as the useful life of goodwill  as compared to the maximum year life permitted by generally accepted accounting principles  and amortizes such cost using the straight line method 
other intangible assets  such as software costs  customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to years 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to the company s business and the understanding of its results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
self insured workers compensation reserves 
the company is self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of its employee work sites 
accruals for workers compensation expense are made based upon the company s claims experience and an independent actuarial analysis performed at least once per year  utilizing company experience  as well as claim cost development trends and current workers compensation industry loss information 
as such  a majority of the company s recorded expense for workers compensation is management s best estimate 
management believes that the amount accrued is adequate to cover all known and unreported claims at december  however  if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amount estimated  additional reserves may be required  which would have a material negative effect on operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets indicates there is no impairment based upon projected future cash flows and is predicated  in part  on the company s operating results part ii returning to recent historical levels within the next few years 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded

as compared to a positive 
for revenues for totaled  a decrease of approximately  or from revenues of  the decrease in total revenues was due  in part  to the continued softening of business conditions in the company s market areas  particularly in the company s northern california operations  which accounted for approximately of the decline in total revenues for  to competition  as well as to management s decision to terminate the company s relationship with certain customers who provided insufficient gross margin in relation to such risk factors as workers compensation coverage and credit 
as of the date of this filing  revenue trends continue to be negatively affected by weak overall economic conditions 
the company has recently hired several new managers throughout its operating regions  which management believes will have a positive effect on the company s business prospects in the future 
staffing services revenue decreased  or  while professional employer services revenue decreased  or  which resulted in a decrease in the share of staffing services to of total revenues for  as compared to for the decrease in staffing services revenue for was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for the company s services in the majority of areas in which the company does business owing to general economic conditions 
the share of professional employer part ii services revenues had a corresponding increase from of total revenues for to for the decrease in professional employer services revenue for was primarily due to a decline in the company s northern california region as a result of management s decision to discontinue its services to a few high volume  low margin customers 
gross margin for totaled  which represented a decrease of  or from the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for the decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to higher workers compensation expenses offset in part by lower direct payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in workers compensation expense  as a percentage of revenues  from of revenues for to for  was primarily due to an increase in the adverse development of estimated future costs of workers compensation claims primarily related to and injuries concentrated in the company s california operations 
the decrease in direct payroll costs  in total dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was attributable to decreases in contract staffing and on site management  of which direct payroll costs generally represent a higher percentage of revenues  and to a lesser extent to increases in the rates the company invoices customers for its services 
the decrease in payroll taxes and benefits for  in total dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to lower state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates as compared to the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  including the mix within the staffing segment  as well as the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
in connection with the company s self insured workers compensation program  the company has maintained an excess workers compensation policy which limits the financial effect of costly workers compensation claims 
for the calendar years and  such policies included a self insured retention or deductible of  and  per occurrence  respectively 
effective january   the self insured retention or deductible on the company s excess workers compensation policy increased to  per occurrence 
management believes that the company obtained the most favorable terms and conditions available in the market  in view of the effect of the events of september   on the insurance industry and the company s size and scope of operations 
management believes that the increased self insured retention will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing of its services 
sg a expenses for amounted to  a decrease of  or from sg a expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased from for to for the decrease in total sg a dollars was primarily due to decreases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of the downturn in the company s business 
depreciation and amortization totaled  or of revenues for  which compares to  or of revenues for the increased depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a full year of amortization in compared to ten months of amortization in arising from the march  implementation of the company s management information system 
part ii other expense totaled  for  which compares to  or of revenues for the decrease in expense was primarily due to lower net interest expense as a result of lower debt levels and a decline in interest rates in compared to the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its work site employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under code section  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan and group disability insurance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s k plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the internal revenue service the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with peo employees 
the issue of whether the company s tax qualified benefit plans can legally include work site employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved 
if the work site employees cannot be covered by the plans  then the exclusive benefit requirement imposed by the code would not be met by the plans as currently administered and the plans could be disqualified 
the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether peos  such as the company  are the employers of work site employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to work site employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the irs study group is reportedly also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peo companies under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
to the best of the company s knowledge  the market segment study group has not issued a report 
a peo company headquartered in texas stated publicly over six years ago that the irs national office was being requested by the irs houston district to issue a technical advice memorandum tam on the peo work site employee issue in connection with an ongoing audit of a plan of the texas peo company 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel in closing cases and to establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the irs s position is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
the request for a tam by the irs houston district reportedly stated its determination that the texas peo company s code section k plan should be disqualified for the reason  among others  that it covers work site employees who are not employees of the peo company 
the timing and nature of the issuance and contents of any tam regarding the work site employee issue or any report of the market segment study group regarding employee leasing is unknown at this time 
there has also been public discussion for the past several years of the possibility that the treasury department may propose some form of administrative relief or that congress may provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue 
part ii in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is not presently able to predict the likelihood of disqualification or the resulting range of loss  in light of the lack of public direction from the irs or congress 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to  a decrease of  or from net income of  the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a lower gross margin percent as a result of higher workers compensation expense and slightly higher direct payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits  expressed as a percentage of revenues  coupled with higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
basic and diluted earnings per share for were 
as compared to 
for both basic and diluted earnings per share for revenues for totaled  a decrease of approximately  or from revenues of  the decrease in total revenues was primarily due to the shortage of available qualified personnel in a low unemployment economy  to management s decision to discontinue services to certain customers due to unacceptable profit margins or risks associated with credit or workplace safety and to a softening in demand for the company s services in the fourth quarter of owing to general economic conditions 
staffing services revenue decreased  or  while professional employer services revenue decreased  or  which resulted in an increase in the share of staffing services to of total revenues for  as compared to for the decrease in staffing services revenue for was primarily attributable to a shortage in supply of qualified people and to general economic conditions in the fourth quarter of the share of professional employer services revenues had a corresponding decrease from of total revenues for to for the decrease in professional employer services for was primarily due to the company s decision to terminate several marginally profitable or higher risk customers 
gross margin for totaled  which represented a decrease of  or from the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for the decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to higher workers compensation expenses and slightly higher direct payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits 
the increase in workers compensation expense  in total dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was primarily due to an increase in the average cost per claim 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  was attributable to increases in contract staffing and on site management  of which payroll costs generally represent a higher percentage of revenues 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits for was primarily attributable to increased direct payroll in california  which has a higher state unemployment tax rate as compared to other states in which the company operates 
sg a expenses for amounted to  a decrease of  or from sg a expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased from for to for the decrease in total sg a dollars was primarily due to decreases in management payroll and related payroll tax expense  and profit sharing and related taxes 
part ii depreciation and amortization totaled  or of revenues for  which compares to  or of revenues for the increased depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a full year of amortization in compared to seven months of amortization in of intangibles recognized in the mid acquisition of tsu staffing and to increased depreciation and amortization expense arising from the march  implementation of the company s new information system 
other expense totaled  or of revenues for  which compares to  or of revenues for the increase in expense was primarily due to higher net interest expense related to new debt incurred to finance the acquisition of tsu staffing 
the company s effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to increased federal tax credits earned by the company 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand and competition for the company s services and the effect of acquisitions 
the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries 
as a result  the company may have greater revenues and net income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs  but tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues and direct payroll later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated workers compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position at december  of  increased by  from december   which compares to a decrease of  for the year ended december  the increase in cash at december  was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of  offset in part by payments on long term debt and common stock repurchases 
net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  as compared to  for for  cash flow included  of depreciation and amortization  coupled with a decrease in accounts receivable of  and an increase in workers compensation claims and safety incentive liabilities of  offset in part by decreases of  in accrued payroll and benefits and  in other accrued liabilities and an increase of  in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled  for  as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for for  the principal source of cash for investing activities was from net proceeds of  from maturities of marketable securities and  of proceeds associated with the sale of a company owned office condominium  offset in part by  of net purchases of marketable securities and purchases of office equipment 
for  the principal use of cash for investing activities was part ii for capital expenditures of  primarily related to new computer hardware and software for the company s new management information system  which was implemented on march  additionally  during  the company paid  representing the final contingent payment and acquisition costs related to the tss acquisition 
the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash used in financing activities for amounted to  which compares to  in for  the principal use of cash for financing activities was for scheduled payments on long term debt of  and common stock repurchases totaling  offset in part by net proceeds from the company s revolving credit line totaling  for  the principal use of cash for financing activities was for common stock repurchases totaling  scheduled payments on long term debt of  and net repayments on the company s revolving credit line totaling  the term loan was obtained in may to provide financing for the tsu acquisition and  at december   had an outstanding principal balance of  the company renewed its loan agreement the agreement with its principal bank in may  which provided for a secured revolving credit facility of the lesser of million or percent of trade accounts receivable and the then unamortized balance of million of a year term loan 
this agreement  which expires july   also includes a subfeature for standby letters of credit in connection with certain workers compensation surety arrangements  as to which approximately million were outstanding as of december  the company had an outstanding balance of million on the revolving credit facility at december  see note of the notes to financial statements 
as a result of financial covenant violations as of december   the company  subsequent to year end  obtained the bank s agreement to waive the covenant violations as of december  in view of management s expectations that additional covenant violations will likely occur as of march  and june   the company is currently renegotiating certain terms of its loan agreement with its principal bank 
management believes that such negotiations will result in amendments which will not be materially adverse to the company s future operating results 
such amendments to the terms and conditions will likely include an increase in the interest rate  monthly financial reporting and a monthly determination of an available borrowing base  as defined by eligible accounts receivable balances 
management expects that the funds anticipated to be generated from operations  together with the amended bank credit facility and other potential sources of financing  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
although the agreement  as amended  expires on july   management presently expects to renew this arrangement with its current principal bank or to obtain a new credit facility with an affiliate of the same bank on terms and conditions which will reflect the then current credit market conditions and the company s projected operating performance 
if  however  the terms and conditions for renewal with its current principal bank or an affiliate of the bank are unacceptable to the company  management will seek the most favorable terms available in the market 
it is management s further belief that a new credit facility from alternative sources in the market will be available and that  while the financial effect of new terms and conditions may increase the company s overall borrowing costs  such increased expenses would not be materially adverse to the company 
part ii in connection with the company s ability to continue its self insured workers compensation program in the state of california  the company must increase its existing surety deposit with the state  which is in the form of a letter of credit  by approximately  effective may  refer to a discussion of risk factors above under forward looking information 
management believes that its principal bank will accommodate the company s request to provide the increase to the existing letter of credit on a timely basis 
during  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
since inception  the board of directors has approved five increases in the total number of shares or dollars authorized to be repurchased under the program 
the stock repurchase program had  of remaining authorization for the repurchase of additional shares at december  during  the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate price of  management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december   including long term debt  commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries  are summarized below payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt  operating leases   long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries total contractual cash obligations    inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the company s short term and long term debt obligations 
as of december   the company had interest bearing debt obligations of approximately million  of which approximately million bears interest at a variable rate and approximately million at a fixed rate of interest 
the variable rate debt is comprised of approximately million outstanding under a revolving credit facility  which bears interest at prime less 
the company also has a secured term note due may  with its principal bank  which bears interest at libor plus 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt or its results of operations 
as of december   the company had not entered into any interest rate instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk
