item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas 
this situation often leads to volatility in the company s revenues and profitability  especially in the united states and canada  where the company historically has generated in excess of of its revenues 
due to aging oilfields and lower cost sources of oil internationally  drilling activity in the united states has declined more than from its peak in record low drilling activity levels were experienced in  and again in early despite a recovery in the latter half of fiscal  the us average fiscal rig count of active rigs represented the lowest in history 
a recovery in us drilling occurred in fiscal and due to exceptionally strong oil and natural gas prices  yet drilling activity retreated in fiscal for the months ended september   the active us rig count averaged rigs  a decrease from fiscal and a increase over fiscal much of the decrease occurred in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas  which for fiscal decreased from the previous fiscal year 
crude oil and natural gas prices have stabilized over the past several months and us drilling activity has leveled out 
the company s management believes that such activity will remain flat for the next six months and increase moderately in the second half of fiscal drilling activity outside north america has historically been less volatile than domestic drilling activity 
international drilling activity also reached record low levels during due to low oil prices during most of the year 
while canadian drilling activity began to recover during the latter part of fiscal  activity in most of the other international regions did not begin to significantly recover until the latter half of fiscal active international drilling rigs excluding canada averaged rigs during fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal canadian drilling activity declined in fiscal averaging active drilling rigs  down from the previous fiscal year 
the company expects international drilling activity including canada in fiscal to be consistent with levels experienced in fiscal critical accounting policies the company has defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires the management of the company to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
for information concerning the company s other significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot give any assurances that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the cyclical nature of our industry may affect our customers operating performance and cash flows  which could impact our ability to collect on these obligations 
in addition  many of our customers are located in certain international areas that are inherently subject to risks of economic  political and civil instabilities  which may impact our ability to collect these accounts receivables 
inventory the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand  market conditions  production requirements and technological developments 
significant or unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in our financial condition could affect these estimates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
self insurance accruals the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits 
as such  the company makes judgements based on historical experience and current events to estimate our liability for such claims 
significant and unanticipated changes in future actual payouts could result in additional increases or decreases to the recorded accruals 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences 
contingencies contingencies are accounted for in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal  and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
acquisition on may   the company completed the acquisition of osca  inc osca  a completion services pressure pumping  completion tools and completion fluids company based in lafayette  louisiana  with operations primarily in the us gulf of mexico  brazil and venezuela for a total purchase price of million

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue due to declines in us and canadian drilling activity and pricing  the company s revenue for fiscal declined to billion from record revenues recorded in fiscal of billion 
the fiscal revenues increased over fiscal and reflected significant improvements in the us market  in both activity and pricing 
management expects the company s fiscal revenues to increase approximately reflecting the fiscal acquisition of osca and an otherwise flat market 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the previous fiscal year 
the company s gross profit was million in fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal the gross profit decline was primarily due to activity and pricing declines in the us and canadian markets 
in addition there were increases in research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative expenses of million primarily as a result of the acquisition of osca 
these were offset by a million decline in goodwill amortization as a result of the company s adoption of sfas  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended september   operating income was million  an increase of million over the previous fiscal year 
the company s gross profit was million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the margin improvement was primarily a result of pricing improvement in the us  better equipment utilization and labor efficiencies 
partially offsetting the improved margins were increases in research and engineering  marketing and general and administrative expenses totaling million due to increased costs to support the higher revenue level and higher employee incentive costs  which are based upon the company s earnings and stock price performance 
each of these operating expenses  however  declined as a percentage of revenues 
other interest expense in decreased by million compared to the previous year due to lower average debt levels throughout the year

partially offsetting this gain was minority interest expense for the year of million and a million premium associated with the repurchase and retirement of million of the company s notes maturing in other expense  net in fiscal consisted primarily of minority interest expense of million  which was partially offset by a settlement gain of million recognized on the conversion of a pension plan in canada 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate has remained below the us statutory rate during each of the past three years primarily as a result of profitability in international jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is less than the us rate  the availability of certain non recurring tax benefits and the availability of tax benefits from the company s reorganization pursuant to its initial public offering in the effective tax rate was in  in and in us mexico pressure pumping segment the company s us mexico pressure pumping revenues declined million  or in fiscal to million from the previous year s record of billion 
the decline was primarily due to decreased drilling and workover activity which declined and  respectively  from the prior year and lower prices in the us as the market weakened 
the fiscal revenues represented a increase over revenues 
this increase occurred primarily due to increased drilling and workover activity  which increased and  respectively over the prior year  along with an average improvement in us pricing for the company s products and services of approximately 
in addition  revenue in the company s mexico operations increased by million in fiscal compared to as a result of a new contract 
management believes that fiscal revenues generated by its us mexico pressure pumping operations will increase only slightly as activity levels are not expected to improve until the second half of fiscal operating income for the company s us mexico pressure pumping operations decreased million  or from the prior year to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreased revenues resulting from the decline in drilling and workover activity and corresponding lower prices for the company s products and services as the market weakened 
the company s average us pricing declined approximately from the previous fiscal year 
also contributing to the decline was increased labor costs as a percentage of revenue and higher depreciation resulting from the us fleet recapitalization initiative  a program which began in late to rebuild and upgrade the company s core fleet of fracturing pumping units in the us operating income for the company s us mexico pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal the improvement was due primarily to increased activity  improved pricing  better equipment utilization  and labor efficiencies 
operating income for the company s us mexico pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal international pressure pumping segment revenue for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or compared with the previous fiscal year 
the revenue decrease is largely attributable to the company s canadian operations  with a decrease in revenue corresponding to a drop in drilling activity from the previous year 
the company also had a decrease in revenues in latin america of as compared to the prior year due primarily to activity declines in argentina and venezuela as a result of political uncertainties and economic declines 
revenue from operations in the eastern hemisphere which includes the company s operations in europe and africa  the middle east  asia pacific  russia and china increased year over year led by increases in the middle east 
increased activity levels in india and kazakstan are the main contributors to the middle east growth 
in fiscal  revenue for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million  an increase of compared with fiscal this was the result of an increase in canadian gas drilling  increased stimulation activity in several international regions and contributions from international geographic expansions 
revenue for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal based on expected drilling and activity levels  revenues for the company s international pressure pumping operations are expected to improve slightly in fiscal from levels 
operating income for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or from the prior year primarily due to reduced activity in canada and political uncertainties and economic declines in argentina and venezuela  combined with approximately million of combined costs from the devaluation of argentina s currency and severance costs incurred in connection with reductions in personnel in canada and latin america during the second quarter of fiscal the eastern hemisphere experienced a decrease in operating income from fiscal primarily due to decreased profitability in the europe and africa region 
as a result of the improved activity in fiscal  operating income for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million  an increase of million over the previous year 
in addition to the increased activity  operating margins as a percentage of revenues improved from in fiscal to in fiscal due mostly to startup costs in selected international locations that negatively impacted operating margins in fiscal operating income for the company s international pressure pumping operations was million in fiscal other oilfield services segment revenue for the company s other oilfield service lines  which consist of specialty chemicals  tubular services  process and pipeline services  completion tools and completion fluids  were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or over the previous year 
approximately million of the increase relates to the completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca effective may  other oilfield services revenues excluding completion fluids and completion tools increased in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
tubular service revenues increased by through activity improvements and expansion in west africa and the middle east 
the process and pipeline and specialty chemicals division revenues were flat year over year 
operating income for the company s other oilfield service lines decreased million  or from fiscal despite the year over year revenue increase due to reduced profit margins in process and pipeline services operations combined with million of costs associated with the acquisition of osca  consisting primarily of the disposal of completion tools deemed obsolete as a result of the combination 
operating income for the company s other oilfield service lines increased million above fiscal figures to reach million of related revenue for the year ended september  operating income margins in the company s tubular services and process and pipeline services lines benefited most from the increased revenue as they were better able to cover their relatively high fixed cost base 
operating income for these service lines was million of related revenue in fiscal capital resources and liquidity at september   cash and cash equivalents equaled million compared with million and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
net cash provided from operating activities for fiscal totaled million  a decrease of million compared with primarily due to reduced profitability  partially offset by the liquidation of working capital  particularly accounts receivable 
net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal increased million from that of fiscal due primarily to higher profitability and million of cash benefit resulting from the utilization of us tax loss carryforwards 
this was partially offset by increases in working capital  particularly accounts receivable  as a result of the revenue growth in north america 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  primarily attributable to amounts required to fund acquisitions as well as the company s capital expenditure needs 
the capital spending of million was used primarily for replacement and enhancement of us fracturing equipment and expansion of stimulation and cementing services internationally 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was million  compared to net cash provided by investing activities in of million 
fiscal capital spending of million was the largest portion of the net cash used for investing activities 
capital expenditures for fiscal increased million from and were used to replace and enhance us fracturing equipment and expand stimulation resources internationally 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be at a level consistent with fiscal spending at approximately million 
the capital program is expected to consist primarily of spending for the enhancement of the company s existing pressure pumping equipment  investment in the us fracturing fleet recapitalization initiative and stimulation expansion internationally 
the actual amount of capital expenditures will be primarily dependent on the availability of expansion opportunities and is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities and available credit facilities 
management believes cash flows from operating activities and available lines of credit  if necessary  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures 
cash flows required to fund investing activities in fiscal exceeded cash flows from operations 
the incremental cash requirements of the company were funded with million in proceeds  net of transaction costs  generated through the issuance of convertible senior notes on april  other financing activities in fiscal include the purchase of million shares of the company s common stock at a cost of million under a share repurchase program initially approved by the company s board of directors in december the share repurchase program  as amended  authorizes purchases up to million  million of which was available for future purchase as of september  cash flows used for financing activities for fiscal were million  compared to cash flows of million used for financing activities in fiscal in connection with the june replacement of its existing credit facility  the company prepaid million of borrowings that were outstanding under the term loan portion of the credit facility

in connection with the private placement  the company also entered into privately negotiated option agreements pursuant to which it repurchased an equivalent number of shares in april for a total of million 
in april  the company utilized proceeds of million from the exercise of outstanding warrants  combined with borrowings under existing credit facilities  to fund the repurchase of these shares 
management strives to maintain low cash balances while utilizing available credit facilities to meet the company s capital needs 
any excess cash generated has historically been used to pay down outstanding borrowings or fund the company s share repurchase program 
in june  the company replaced its existing credit facility with a new million committed line of credit committed credit facility 
the committed credit facility consists of a million  day commitment that renews annually at the option of the lenders and a million three year commitment 
the day commitment that expired in june was renewed for an additional days 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the committed credit facility at september  in addition to the committed credit facility  the company had million in various unsecured  discretionary lines of credit at september   which expire at various dates in there are no requirements for commitment fees or compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit and interest on borrowings is based on prevailing market rates 
there was million and million in outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at september  and  respectively 
on april  the company sold convertible senior notes with a face value at maturity of million gross proceeds of million 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of the company s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the company used the aggregate net proceeds of million to fund a substantial portion of the purchase price of its acquisition of osca which closed on may  and for general corporate purposes 
the notes will mature in years and cannot be called by the company for three years after issuance 
the redemption price must be paid in cash if the notes are called 
holders of the notes can require the company to repurchase the notes on the third  fifth  tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the issuance 
the company has the option to pay the repurchase price in cash or stock 
the issue price of the notes was for each  in face value  which represents a yield to maturity of 
of this annual yield to maturity  per year on the issue price will be paid semi annually in cash for the life of the security 
the notes are convertible into bj services common stock at an initial rate of shares for each  face amount note 
this rate results in an initial conversion price of per share based on the purchaser s original issue discount and represents a premium of over the april  closing sale price of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange of per share 
the company has the option to settle notes that are surrendered for conversion using cash 
generally  except upon the occurrence of specified events  including a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade  holders of the notes are not entitled to exercise their conversion rights until the company s stock price is greater than a specified percentage beginning at and declining to at the maturity of the notes of the accreted conversion price per share 
at september   the accreted conversion price per share would have been

annual commitments under these agreements for the years ending september     and are million  million  million  million and million  respectively  and million in the aggregate thereafter 
in december  the company completed a transaction involving the transfer of certain pumping service equipment assets and received million that was used to pay outstanding bank debt 
the equipment is used to provide services to customers for which the company pays a service fee over a period of at least six  but not more than years 
the transaction generated a deferred gain  included in other long term liabilities  of approximately million  which is being amortized over years 
in  the company completed a transaction involving the transfer of certain pumping service equipment assets and received million that was used to pay outstanding bank debt 
the equipment is used to provide services to the company s customers for which the company pays a service fee over a period of at least eight  but not more than years 
the transaction generated a deferred gain  included in other long term liabilities  of approximately million  which is being amortized over years 
due primarily to the april issuance of convertible senior notes  the company s total interest bearing debt increased to of its total capitalization total capitalization equals the sum of interest bearing debt and stockholders equity at september   compared to at september  the committed credit facility includes various customary covenants and other provisions including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios  none of which materially restrict the company s activities 
management believes that the committed credit facility  combined with other discretionary credit facilities and cash flows from operations  provides the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations  meet debt service obligations and fund projected capital expenditures 
if the discretionary lines of credit are not renewed  or if borrowings under these lines of credit otherwise become unavailable  the company expects to refinance this debt by arranging additional committed bank facilities or through other long term borrowing alternatives

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings but instead must be reviewed for possible impairment 
the company ceased the amortization of goodwill beginning october  according to the requirements of sfas  the company performed a transitional fair value based impairment test on its goodwill and determined that fair value exceeded the recorded amount at october   therefore no impairment loss has been recorded 
the company s net goodwill balance at september  has been assessed by management to be fully recoverable 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement legal obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  associated costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires entities to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of adoption 
the company will adopt sfas on october  and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas supercedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no 
 while retaining many of the requirements of these two statements 
under sfas  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from ongoing operations and the reporting entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the discontinued operations prospectively 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas is not expected to materially change the methods used by the company to measure impairment losses on long lived assets but may result in future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations to a greater extent than is currently permitted 
the company will adopt sfas on october  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas statements no 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
the purpose of this statement is to update  clarify and simplify existing accounting standards 
we adopted this statement effective april  and determined that it did not have any significant impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas replaces accounting guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in october  the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  that would amend fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the purpose of the proposed amendment is to enable companies that choose to adopt the fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption and make available to investors better and more frequent disclosure about the cost of employee stock options 
the fasb intends to issue the amendment by the end of because the final rules are being debated and remain uncertain  the company continues with the disclosure only provisions of sfas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s treatment of stock options
