growth risks 
a significant portion of the company s growth has resulted and is expected to continue to result from the opening of new stores 
while the company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain suitable locations for new stores  negotiate acceptable lease terms  hire qualified personnel and open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis  no such assurances can be made 
as the company continues its expansion program  the opening of stores may adversely affect catalog and internet sales in such markets  and the opening of additional stores in existing markets may adversely affect sales and profits of established stores 
competition 
the retail apparel business is highly competitive and is expected to remain so 
the company competes primarily with other specialty retailers  department stores and other catalogers engaged in the retail sale of apparel  and to a lesser degree with other apparel retailers 
many of these competitors are much larger than the company have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
the company believes that its emphasis on classic styles makes it less vulnerable to changes in fashion trends than many apparel retailers  however  the company s sales and profitability depend upon the continued demand for its classic styles 
reliance on key suppliers 
historically  the company has bought a substantial portion of its products from a limited number of suppliers 
the loss of any one of these suppliers could cause a delay in the company s sales process 
any significant interruption in the company s product supply could have an adverse effect on its business due to delays in finding alternative sources and could result in increased costs to the company 
growth by acquisition  etc 
the company may from time to time hold discussions and negotiations with i potential investors who express an interest in making an investment in or acquiring the company  ii potential joint venture partners looking toward the formation of strategic alliances and iii companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities for the company 
there can be no assurance any definitive agreement will be reached regarding the foregoing  nor does the company believe that at this time any such agreement is necessary to implement successfully its strategic plans 
accounting policies the company believes the following critical accounting policy affects management s significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of this and other accounting policies  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
inventory 
the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
seasonality historically  the company s operations had not been greatly affected by seasonal fluctuations 
although variations in sales volumes do exist between quarters  the company believes the nature of its merchandise helps to stabilize demand between the different periods of the year 
however  as the company s merchandise continues to include more corporate casual and sportswear  profits generated during the fourth quarter have become a larger portion of annual profits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at february   there were no derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the company does not believe it is materially at risk for changes in market interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s interest on borrowings under its credit agreement is at a variable rate based on the prime rate or a spread over the libor
