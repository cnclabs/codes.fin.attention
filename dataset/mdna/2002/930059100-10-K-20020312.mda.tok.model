investment management fee revenues investment management fee revenues are earned for providing investment advisory services to the funds and to institutional and separate accounts 
over investment management fees decreased by million  or  in compared with  reflecting the decrease in average assets under management 
the decline in the market  represented by the daily average close of the s p index in compared to  is the primary cause of the decrease in average assets under management

management fee revenues from institutional and separate accounts declined by million  or  compared to institutional and separate account average assets under management declined during in  performance based fees earned on institutional and separately managed accounts were million lower than in the same period last year  thereby causing a larger decline in revenue than the related average assets 
removing the impact of performance based fees in and  management fees for institutional and separate accounts decreased 
in  the average management fee rate for institutional and separate accounts improved to basis points from basis points as new business with higher fee rates offset lower performance based fees and lost business with substantially lower rates 
over the increase in management fee revenues came from both mutual fund and institutional and separate account business 
revenue from mutual fund management fees comprised of total management fee revenue 
in  mutual fund revenue increased million  or  to million 
average mutual fund assets under management increased to billion 
effective july   management fee arrangements were restructured  increasing the overall mutual fund management fee rates by approximately basis points 
in  management fee revenue from mutual funds increased at a greater rate than that of mutual fund average assets due to a full year of benefit from the restructured rates 
the average management fee rate for mutual funds improved from basis points in to basis points in  representing approximately million in management fee revenues 
management fee revenues from institutional and separate account business accounted for of total management fee revenue 
revenue from these accounts increased by million  or  to million in average institutional and separate account assets under management increased to billion 
the average management fee rate for institutional and separate accounts increased from basis points to basis points 
this increase was partially attributable to the acquisition of acf in august of  as well as new accounts added with higher fee rates 
certain managed accounts lost during the year had significantly lower rates than those currently in effect 
managed assets of acf contributed million  or  to the increase in revenues from institutional and separate accounts 
certain separate accounts allow for additional fees contingent upon certain relative performance measurements being met 
these performance fees were million in and million in underwriting and distribution fee revenues underwriting and distribution fee revenues are derived primarily from sales commissions charged on front load mutual funds  variable annuities  and other insurance products

in  commission revenues from front load investment products were million  a decrease of million  or  from  while sales of these products increased 
sales of variable products were billion in compared with billion in  an increase of 
included in variable product sales in is million of commissionable variable annuity exchanges 
front load revenues decreased while the related sales increased due to significantly lower commission rates on commissionable variable annuity exchanges and a larger number of new sales in of variable products with a lower commission structure 
overall  commission rates on variable annuity products declined from in to in the increase in commissionable variable annuity exchanges resulted primarily from our clients exchanging their uilic policies into nationwide policies offering more attractive features and service see additional discussion in item legal proceedings 
while these exchanges are beneficial to our clients individually  at the corporate level  they are unproductive in that they divert the efforts of our advisors away from selling new products and thus  they do not increase our assets under management 
since these exchanges are much less profitable over the long term  advisor compensation is structured to discourage the activity 
despite this disincentive  the volume is a direct result of having more competitive nationwide variable products available to our advisors for their use in providing the best service possible to our clients 
asset based fee revenues earned on deferred load products class b and class c shares  declined  or million  primarily due to the decline in related assets under management 
this decline in assets was largely the result of stock market depreciation

over of variable product sales are variable annuity products 
variable annuity product sales were especially strong in  growing  while class a share sales grew 
agency commissions paid by the underwriting insurance companies have higher commission rates than that of class a share mutual funds causing revenues to increase at a higher rate than sales 
the average commission rate for variable annuity products in was  compared with the average commission rate for front end mutual funds of 
in addition  an enhanced variable annuity compensation agreement with uilic effective january  added million of asset based fees to revenues in see additional discussion in item legal proceedings 
revenues from deferred load investment products class b and class c shares are primarily derived from a b distribution fee on these assets  and to a lesser extent from contingent deferred sales charges on early redemption of shares 
these revenues increased by million  or  as average assets in these share classes increased by million

shareholder service fee revenues shareholder service fee revenues include transfer agency fees  custodian fees from retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting fees 
over shareholder service fee revenue increased by million  or  to million in due primarily to the increase in the average number of accounts serviced

this non cash charge relates to promissory notes that were extended to a select group of financial advisors and sales managers to facilitate their ownership of our stock at our ipo in march of and drive future advisor productivity and retention growth 
this charge results from financial advisors and sales managers having now collectively met the productivity requirements of the stock loan program  such that the notes are expected to be forgiven 
excluding this charge  the increase in expense was million  or 
direct expenses  expenses relating to sales volume such as commissions  advisor incentive compensation  and commission overrides paid to field management  decreased million  or  in correlation with the decline in retail investment product sales

our distribution margin  excluding legend  was compared with for the same period in margin improvement was attributable to enhanced compensation agreements on certain products and also to the fact that growth in sales exceeded that of fixed costs such as sales support  which do not fluctuate with sales volume

over general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for acf contributed million in and million from the time of acquisition in august through december  legend  acquired march   contributed million to these costs in excluding these costs from recently acquired companies  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  a result of investments made to facilitate growth  notably in computer systems and services and costs associated with implementing new funds and share classes 
also contributing to the increase were higher rental and facilities costs from expanding operations 
investment and other income over investment income declined by million  or 
in  realized gains from the sale of investment securities were million less than in in  investment and other income included million of realized gains from the sale of investment securities sold to partially fund the legend acquisition 
less interest was earned on investments in the current year due to lower average interest rates 
the average investment in commercial paper was million in compared with million in the decreased average investment in commercial paper paired with lower short term interest rates yielded a million decline in income on these investments

other less significant sources of increase in depreciation expense were additions to capitalized software  leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment 
over depreciation of property and equipment increased by million  or  in to million 
the acquisitions of acf on august  and legend on march  accounted for thousand of the increase

for  the specified earnings level was met and an additional purchase price payment in the amount of million was made and recorded as an addition to goodwill 
because earnings levels were not met during  there were no purchase price payments required to be made under the agreement

the purchase agreement provides for additional contingent purchase price payments in two situations

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that require recognition and reporting separately from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions in the statement 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
we adopted the provisions of sfas upon its issuance and sfas effective january  as of january   we are no longer amortizing goodwill 
on the date of adoption of sfas  in accordance with sfas  we performed an evaluation of our goodwill that was acquired in prior business combinations to identify intangible assets that require recognition and reporting apart from goodwill and concluded that we have no separately identifiable intangible assets requiring recognition apart from goodwill 
also on the date of adoption of sfas  in accordance with that statement  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that no impairment of goodwill exists at the date of adoption 
we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million at december  as a result of the adoption of sfas  it is anticipated that amortization expense related to goodwill will be approximately million lower for than that which would have been recognized under prior accounting rules 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
seasonability and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
events of september  fortunately  none of our employees were lost or injured and none of our properties or records were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september  although our operations during that week were severely hampered by the temporary disruption of the financial markets  management does not believe the impact was material 
however  although we believe the basic elements of our business that are in our control are sound  at this time  we are unable to predict the long term impact of these events  on either our industry as a whole or our operations and financial condition in particular 
risk factors we are at risk of litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and adversely impact our earnings we are in litigation with united investors life insurance company uilic  and other related parties over terms of a compensation agreement we entered into in july pursuant to the agreement  uilic was to pay us compensation at varying rates on variable annuities underwritten by uilic and distributed by us 
in may uilic challenged the validity and duration of that agreement and subsequently asserted various contractual and tort damage claims against us regarding our replacement of uilic variable policies with nationwide variable policies 
all claims and counterclaims asserted in the action will be decided at trial which began on february  in august  a nasd dispute resolution arbitration panel entered an award of million against waddell reed  inc the award arose from a complaint by a former financial advisor of the company 
the panel directed payment of approximately million in compensatory damages  plus attorney s fees of  it also ordered the payment of punitive damages in the amount of million 
the former advisor filed a petition seeking to confirm the award and we are seeking to have the award vacated or modified 
it is anticipated that the new york supreme court will make a decision regarding the award sometime in these litigation matters could result in substantial costs to the company and divert resources and management s attention from operations 
such costs and diversions could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
we could experience adverse effects due to strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage firms  investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  internet investment sites  and other financial institutions 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer an ever increasing number of other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services and brand recognition and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable those fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us  our market share  revenues  and income would decline 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital 
we have entered into a day revolving credit facility with various lenders for a total of million  whereby the banks could  at their option upon our request  expand the facility to million 
in august  we also began utilizing money market loans  which function similarly to commercial paper 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit and the outstanding balance related to the money market loans was million 
the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility and the money market loans impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  merge  sell assets  pay dividends  and create or incur liens 
our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions  a breach of which could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon  and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  asset values  perception of our creditworthiness  and indirectly  the market value of our stock 
these factors will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other circumstances  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing credit facility or its refinancing and or cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our business plans  meet our operating expenses  and service our debt requirements as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
our investment management business is heavily regulated 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations would adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues  and earnings 
in addition  changes in current laws or regulations or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues  and earnings 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our class a common stock  however  the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition  and contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period 
our ability to hire and retain key personnel and financial advisors is significant to our success 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive 
we are dependent on our sales force and select third party distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality  quantity  and productivity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts 
good relative performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good relative performance also attracts institutional and separate accounts 
conversely  poor relative performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares and the loss of institutional and separate accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues  earnings and prospects if the securities markets continue to decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
we benefited from the favorable performance of the securities markets in recent years  which attracted a substantial increase in the investments in the securities markets 
the securities markets have declined in recent months  however  and the continuation of adverse market conditions or continued volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings  and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  investment management fees based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets adversely affects our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets  and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
the combination of adverse markets reducing sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially affect earnings 
adverse conditions in the us domestic stock market are particularly material to us due to high concentration of assets under management in that market 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our employees and or advisors could result in liability to our clients 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds for our clients as well as financial and personal information for our clients 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
systems failure may disrupt our business 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and also on the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting  and other data processing systems 
if any of these do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention  or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be sure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
there may be an adverse effect on our business if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that  as required by law  are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders  as required by law 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or may not be renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts 
under certain conditions  the rights under our stockholders rights plan entitle the holders of such rights to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
the rights are attached to each share of our outstanding class a common stock and generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power represented by our class a common stock 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer  or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer  or takeover is in their best interests  and even if such transactions could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board of directors pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
our board of directors is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board 
in addition  as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
we may have difficulty executing our acquisition strategy  which could negatively impact our growth 
our business strategy contemplates our selective pursuit of acquisitions and alliances that will add new products or alternative distribution systems to accelerate earnings growth 
there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to realize our acquisition strategy or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for desired acquisitions 
in addition  we have limited experience in finding  acquiring and integrating other companies and we may not be successful in the integration of acquired companies 
an acquisition may not prove to add new products or distribution systems or otherwise be advantageous to us 
our holding company structure results in structural subordination and may affect our ability to fund our operations and make payments on our debt 
we are a holding company and  accordingly  substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including our million senior notes  are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans  or other payments by our subsidiaries to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities 
our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans  or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans  or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets  would be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our cash equivalents  short term investments and outstanding short term debt are subject to variable interest rates 
we have not used derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
as noted in item  our revenues and net income are based in part on the value of the investment portfolios managed 
accordingly  financial market declines will negatively impact our assets under management and  in turn  our revenues and profitability
