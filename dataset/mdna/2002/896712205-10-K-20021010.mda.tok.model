overview founded in  trio tech international provides third party semiconductor testing and burn in services primarily through its laboratories in southeast asia 
the company also designs  manufactures and markets equipment and systems used in the testing and production of semiconductors at its facilities in california and southeast asia  and distributes semiconductor processing and testing equipment manufactured by others 
the following table set forth our revenue components for the past three years revenue components year ended june  june  june  net sales testing manufacturing distribution total geographically  we operate in the us  singapore  malaysia  thailand  and ireland 
our customers are mainly concentrated in southeast asia and they are either semiconductor chip manufacturers or testing facilities who purchase our testing equipment our revenue is heavily concentrated on two major customers see business section and note to the financial statements for reference 
our cost of sales is made up of the cost of materials used  obsolescence costs  labor  depreciation  utilities which is our major part of consumption for testing services  and overhead relating to manufacturing  testing and distribution 
our expenses can be classified into three general categories selling expense  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense 
selling expenses include expenses for payroll and payroll taxes for employees working in the selling department  advertising  insurance  utilities and other expenses directly related to selling activities 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  property taxes  rental expense  depreciation of fixed assets used by the management function  utilities  employee fringe benefits  office supplies  travel and entertainment  professional expense  outside services and other expenses related to management and administration processes 
research and development expense includes payroll and payroll tax  travel  and any other expenses that are directly related to the research activities 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements use of estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

table of contents inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods by charging such write downs to cost of sales 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales made to customers is recognized when the risk of loss for the product sold passes to the customer and any right of return can be quantified  which is generally when goods are shipped or upon the completion of services 
the company estimates an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
testing revenue is recognized when the services are provided 
income tax we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the regions where they operate 
because of the different income tax jurisdictions  the taxable income generated in foreign countries will not offset the net loss generated in the us therefore  we always incur certain income tax expenses in any fiscal year 
for us income tax purposes  no provision has been made for us taxes on undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries  with which the company intends to continue to reinvest 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings if they were remitted as dividends  were lent to the company  or if the company should sell its stock in the subsidiary 
however  the company believes that us foreign tax credits and net operating losses available would substantially eliminate any additional tax effects 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets such as goodwill and fixed assets for possible impairment whenever  in managements estimate  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in terms of sfas no 
to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using undiscounted cash flows  a write down to fair value is made and a charge is recorded against operations 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales net sales decreased by  or from  in to  in  due to the global downturn in the semiconductor industry and world economic conditions 
however  we believe our backlog by quarter in indicates signs of possible recovery in the first half of our fiscal year 
logo geographically  net sales into and within the united states decreased  or from  in to  in the decrease was attributable to a downturn in sales of burn in boards  artic temperature controlled chucks and wet process benches 
net sales within southeast asia decreased  or from  in to  in mainly due to lower manufacturing and distribution volumes 
net sales for europe decreased  or from  in to  
table of contents in this decrease was due primarily to a decline in demand for testing services  which occurred when several large customers moved from europe to southeast asia 
we have managed to recapture some of this business in southeast asia  due to the fact that our testing services were already established in regions to where the customers relocated

selling expenses selling expenses decreased by or from  in to  in due to reduction in volume related expenses such as commissions 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses increased from in to in due to certain fixed cost elements included in selling expenses 
research and development research and development increased by or from in to in this increase is primarily due to management s decision to invest in research and development to improve its automated wet benches 
the company produced several new systems that allow photo resist stripping  rinsing and drying  all in a single process chamber 
other tools under development include a sophisticated plating tool and an advanced chemical dispensing tool that utilizes ozone injection systems for organic cleaning of silicon wafers 
impairment loss in  the company recorded an impairment loss of approximately  based on its examination of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  which are generated by the subsidiaries where certain long lived assets goodwill and certain fixed assets were used 
the impairment of  consisted of in goodwill  related to the company s acquisition of manufacturing product lines in the united states  in intangibles  used in its manufacturing segment within the united states  and  of fixed assets  consisting of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements  and demonstration pertaining to the southeast asia testing segment and pertaining to the united states manufacturing segment

certain risks that may affect our future results we hereby caution stockholders  prospective investors in trio tech international and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our stock price or cause our actual results for the fiscal year ending june  and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of us 
our operating results are affected by a variety of factors 
table of contents our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others  factors relating to economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  market acceptance of our products and services  changes in technologies in the semiconductor industry  which could affect demand for our products and services  changes in testing processes  the impact of competition  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers and vendors  changes in military or commercial testing specifications  which could affect the market for our products and services  difficulties in profitably integrating acquired businesses  if any  into the company  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  international political or economic events  currency fluctuations  and other technological  economic  financial and regulatory factors beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in these or other factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate revenue growth and any revenue growth that is achieved may not be sustained 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if operating expenses increase and are not subsequently followed by increased revenues 
although through the fourth quarter of we had reported profits for twenty eight consecutive quarters  we were not be able to sustain such profitability for the past four quarters 
the semiconductor industry cycles have a large effect on our business our business depends primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  assemblers and other testing companies worldwide 
these industries depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing semiconductor devices 
the global semiconductor industry generally  and the semiconductor testing equipment industry in particular  are volatile and cyclical  with periodic capacity shortages and excess capacity 
in periods of excess capacity  the industry sharply cuts its purchases of capital equipment  including our distributed products  and reduces testing volumes  including our testing services 
excess capacity also causes downward pressure on the selling prices for our products and services 
our operating results have been adversely affected by past downturns and slowdowns 
there is no assurance that there will not be downturns or slowdowns in the future that may adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
in addition  if one or more of our primary customers reduces its or their purchases or use of our products or testing services  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate that we will continue to be primarily dependent on the semiconductor industry for the foreseeable future 
rapid technological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor industry and may make our services or products obsolete 
advances in technology may lead to significant price erosion for products tested with our older testing technologies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced testing technologies and processes in the future  to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand  to enhance our current products and services  to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost effective basis and to achieve market acceptance of those products and services 
to accomplish these goals  we may be required to incur significant engineering expenses 
as new products or services are introduced  we may experience warranty claims or product returns 
we may not be able to accomplish these goals correctly or timely enough 
if we fail in our efforts  our products and services may become obsolete or less competitive 

table of contents our dependence on international sales involves significant risk sales and services to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  were generated from business in southeast asia 
we expect that our non us sales and services will continue to generate the major part of our future revenues 
testing services in southeast asia were performed primarily for american companies  and to a lesser extent german companies  selling products and doing business in that region 
international business operations may be adversely affected by many factors including fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  trade restrictions  political  economic and business events and social and cultural differences 
we may incur losses due to foreign currency fluctuations significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore dollars  malaysian ringitt and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  a decrease of to shareholders equity for fiscal and a decrease of to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars 
however  we may not be successful in our attempts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
those fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
we do not rely on patents to protect our products or technology we hold us patents relating to our pressurization humidity testing equipment and certain aspects of our arctic temperature test systems 
additionally  in  we were granted patents for certain aspects of our new ranges of arctic temperature chucks 
however  generally we do not rely on patent or trade secret protection for our products or technology 
competitors may be able to copy and replicate our technology and designs 
competitors may develop technologies similar to or more advanced than ours 
we cannot assure you that our current or future products will not be copied or will not infringe on the patents of others 
intense competition can adversely affect our operating results the semiconductor equipment and testing industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors include price  technical capabilities  quality  automation  reliability  product availability and customer service 
we face competition from established and potential new competitors  many of whom have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than our company s resources 
new products or testing facilities offered by our competitors could cause a decline in our revenues or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products and services 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition 
price based competition may result in lower prices  adversely affecting our operating results 
loss  reduction or delay from significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large manufacturers and assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales and testing revenues 
our experience has been that sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal   and  sales of equipment and services to our two largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with our customers is essential to our stability and growth 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from our significant customers  or delays in collecting accounts receivable from our significant customers  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there is a limited market for certain of our products and services if our competitors or we sell testing equipment to semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  the likelihood that they will make further purchases of such equipment  or that they will contract for testing services by our laboratories  may be affected 
although military or other specifications require certain testing to be done by independent laboratories  over time other current customers may have less need for our testing services we believe that there is a growing trend toward outsourcing of the integrated circuit test process 
as a result  we anticipate continued growth in the test laboratory business 
however  in an attempt to diversify our sales mix  we may seek to develop and introduce new or advanced products  and to acquire other companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing business 

table of contents acquisition and integration of new businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our business a portion of any future growth may be accomplished through the acquisition of other entities 
the success of those acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the acquired personnel  operations  products  services and technologies into our organization  to retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired entities and to retain the customers of those entities 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  obtain financing on acceptable terms to bring the acquisition to fruition or to integrate such personnel  operations  products or services 
the process of identifying and closing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquisitions into our operations may distract our management and employees  disrupt our ongoing business  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operations 
we may also be subject to certain other risks if we acquire other entities  such as the assumption of additional liabilities 
we may issue additional equity securities or incur debt to pay for future acquisition we are not dependent on key suppliers we have no written contracts with any of our suppliers 
our suppliers may terminate their relationships with us at any time without notice 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find satisfactory replacement suppliers or that new suppliers would not be more expensive than the current suppliers if any of our suppliers were to terminate their relationship with us 
we are highly dependent on key personnel our success has depended  and  to a large extent will depend  on the continued services of sw yong  our chief executive officer and president  victor h 
m 
ting  our vice president and chief financial officer  and our other key senior executives and engineering  marketing  sales  productions and other personnel 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
yong or mr 
ting  but we are the beneficiary of key man life insurance in the amount of million on mr 
yong and million on mr 
ting 
the loss of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
competition for management in our industry is intense and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the executive management and other key personnel that we require 
our management has significant influence over corporate decisions currently our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own of the outstanding shares of common stock  including options held by them that are exercisable within days of the date of this k 
as a result  they may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of the shareholders  including the election of directors  and may be able to delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
we have not paid cash dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that the future earnings  if any  will be retained for use in the business or for other corporate purposes 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
possible dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants as of june   there were  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
the outstanding options and warrants are currently exercisable at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we anticipate that the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such outstanding options or warrants will exceed the exercise price under those options and warrants 
thus such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
the market price for our common stock is subject to fluctuation the trading price of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely 
the trading price may similarly fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years  broad stock market indices in general  and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations on a daily basis 
fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect our liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality 
table of contents standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate and thus subject us to market risk due to those fluctuations 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
the outstanding aggregate principal balance on loans to us and on our lines of credit range from to per annum 
as of june   the outstanding principal balance on these loans was approximately  these interest rates are subject to change and we cannot predict any increase or decrease in rates  if any 
period ending june  there after total fair value loans denominated by singapore dollars interest rate fixed denominated by singapore dollars interest rate variable denominated irish pound interest rate variable denominated irish pound interest rate variable line of credit denominated by singapore dollars interest rate variable denominated by singapore dollars interest rate variable denominated by us dollars interest rate variable total foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although the majority of our sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars  significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore  malaysian and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  a decrease of to shareholders equity for fiscal and to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars 
however  we may not be successful in our attempts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
those fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results
