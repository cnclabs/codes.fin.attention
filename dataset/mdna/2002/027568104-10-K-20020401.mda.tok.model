the company s business plan focuses on government insured and uninsured mortgages secured by multifamily properties  which may take the form of government insured first mortgages and uninsured mezzanine loans  construction loans  and bridge loans 
additionally  the company has indirectly invested in subordinate commercial mortgage backed securities and may invest in other real estate assets  including non multifamily mortgages 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately  primarily due to proceeds from repayments of mortgage loans   distributions from arcap   and proceeds from repurchase facilities   which was less than cash used for funding of notes receivable  distributions paid to shareholders  an increase in investment in gnma certificates  an increase in investment in mortgage loans  and an increase in repayments of repurchase facilities payable   the net unrealized gains on gnma investments included in shareholders equity aggregated  at december  consisted of gross unrealized gains and losses of  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  from the unrealized loss of  in december  the yield on the gnma certificates will depend  in part  upon the rate and timing of principal prepayments on the underlying mortgages in the asset pool 
generally  as market interest rates decrease  mortgage prepayment rates increase and the market value of interest rate sensitive obligations like the gnma certificates increases 
as market interest rates increase  mortgage prepayment rates tend to decrease and the market value of interest rate sensitive obligations like the gnma certificates tends to decrease 
the effect of prepayments on yield is greater the earlier a prepayment of principal is received 
the yield on the mortgage loans will depend  in part  on when  and if  the company disposes of the mortgage loans prior to maturity or the obligor fully repays the outstanding debt 
the first mortgage loans have fixed interest rates  the base amount of which is insured by hud  resulting in a minimal amount of interest rate risk 
the effects of prepayment on yield is greater the earlier a prepayment of principal is received 
due to the uncertainty of future economic and other factors that affect interest rates and mortgage prepayments  it is not possible to predict the effects of future events upon the yield to maturity or the market value of the mortgage loans upon any sale or other disposition or whether the company  if it chose to  would be able to reinvest proceeds from prepayments at favorable rates relative to the current mortgage loan rates

the company expects that cash generated from the company s investments will meet its needs for short term liquidity  and will be sufficient to pay all of the company s expenses and to make distributions to its shareholders in amounts sufficient to retain the company s reit status in the foreseeable future 
pursuant to the redemption plan which became effective november   the company was required to redeem eligible shares presented for redemption for cash to the extent it had sufficient net proceeds from the sale of shares under the reinvestment plan

additionally  during  the company converted three fha mortgage loans to gnma certificates 
doing so allowed the company to finance these assets at a lower interest rate and higher leverage available under the nomura securities repurchase agreement 
this conversion resulted in an additional million in borrowings of which approximately million was used to repay borrowings under the nomura repurchase facility and million was used for further investments 
bridge loans on july   the company entered into a commitment to fund a maximum bridge loan of  secured by a unit apartment complex located in san diego  ca

commitments and contingencies the company completed a loan program with fannie mae which has agreed to fully fund the origination of million of delegated underwriter and servicer loans for apartment properties that qualify for low income housing tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
under the terms of the loan program  the company will originate and contract for individual loans of up to million dollars each over a two year period  which may be extended for up to two additional one year periods 
in the event the company was to originate million in loans pursuant to this program  the company would be required to guarantee a first loss position equal to the amount lost on the loans up to a maximum of million depending on the aggregate principal amount of the loans the company originates 
in connection with this program  the company has also guaranteed construction loans for which it has issued a forward commitment to originate a loan under the fannie mae program  with respect to which it guarantees repayment of of such construction loans 
as of december   the company has originated one loan totaling approximately million under the fannie mae program and has made forward commitments for an additional approximate million 
the company s maximum guarantee at december  was million 
the company has not acquired an interest in any of the loans the company originated in fannie mae s behalf 
since entering into the loan program  the level of loan origination competition has increased  reducing the company s projected financing volume and profitability 
as a result  the company is de emphasizing this program and evaluating the possibility of transferring its rights and obligations in the loan program to a third party 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
critical accounting policies the company has several accounting policies that require significant judgments to be made by company management 
the company s portfolio of mortgage loans and notes must be periodically evaluated for possible impairment  and appropriate loan loss reserves established 
as of december   all mortgage loans and notes are current and management has determined that none of the company s loans or notes are impaired  and no loan loss reserve is necessary 
the company s gnma certificates are carried at estimated fair values 
changes in these valuations do not impact the company s income or cash flows  but affect shareholders equity 
gnma certificates are relatively liquid investments  and company management estimates their values by reference to the valuations assigned by the company s repurchase lender 
the company has a loan program with fannie mae  under which the company guarantees a first loss position on loans originated by the company and funded by fannie mae 
company management must evaluate the company s exposure to probable losses under this guarantee and record reserves  if necessary 
at december   the company s maximum guarantee under this program was million 
the company has experienced no losses under this program to date and no reserves for probable losses were deemed necessary as of december  the company s mezzanine investments include provisions that allow the company to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s excess cash flows from operations and upon sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such loan  company management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
considerable judgement is involved in making this determination  which affects the balance sheet classification of the investment as well as recognition of revenues derived therefrom 
the company considers the borrower s equity  the amount of the company s participation  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to the company over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making its assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  the company has determined that all mezzanine investments are properly accounted for as loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the investments of the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
interest rate risk interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect the company s income and value of its common shares in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates  variances in the yield curve and changing prepayment rates 
the company s operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from its assets net of credit losses and its borrowing costs 
most of the company s assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  gnma certificates  and notes receivable  or generate fixed returns and will have terms in excess of five years 
the company funds the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence the company s net income 
the company s borrowings under repurchase agreements bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
based on the million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities at december   a change in libor would impact the company s annual net income and cash flows by approximately  increases in these rates will tend to decrease the net income and market value of the company s net assets 
interest rate fluctuations that result in interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses 
the value of the company s assets may be affected by prepayment rates on investments 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond the company s control  and consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
when the company originates mortgage loans  it expects that such mortgage loans will have a measure of protection from prepayment in the form of prepayment lock out periods or prepayment penalties 
however  such protection may not be available with respect to investments which the company acquires  but does not originate 
in periods of declining mortgage interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by the company in assets yielding less than the yields on the investments that were prepaid 
in addition  the market value of mortgage investments may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less from declining interest rates than from other fixed income securities 
conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally decrease  in which case the company would not have the prepayment proceeds available to invest in assets with higher yields 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios the company may fail to recoup fully its cost of acquisition of certain investments 
real estate risk multifamily and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty paying the company s mortgage loan  which could result in losses to the company 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the company s mortgage loans  which could also cause the company to suffer losses 
risk in owning subordinated interests the company has invested indirectly in subordinated cmbs through its ownership of a preferred membership interest in arcap 
subordinated cmbs of the type in which arcap invests include first loss and non investment grade subordinated interests 
a first loss security is the most subordinate class in a structure and accordingly is the first to bear the loss upon a default on restructuring or liquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal 
such classes are subject to special risks  including a greater risk of loss of principal and non payment of interest than more senior  rated classes 
the market values of subordinated interests in cmbs and other subordinated securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior  rated classes 
as a result of these and other factors  subordinated interests generally are not actively traded and may not provide holders with liquidity of investment 
with respect to the company s investment in arcap  the ability to transfer the membership interest in arcap is further limited by the terms of arcap s operating agreement 
participating interest in connection with the acquisition and origination of mortgages  the company has  on occasion  obtained and may continue to obtain participating interests that may entitle it to payments based upon a development s cash flow  profits or any increase in the value of the development that would be realized upon a refinancing or sale of the development 
competition for participating interests is dependent to a large degree upon market conditions 
participating interests are more difficult to obtain when mortgage financing is available at relatively low interest rates 
in the current interest rate environment  the company may have greater difficulty obtaining participating interest 
participating interests are not government insured or guaranteed and are therefore subject to the general risks inherent in real estate investments 
therefore  even if the company is successful in investing in mortgage investments which provide for participating interests  there can be no assurance that such interests will result in additional payments 
repurchase facility collateral risk repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the company may decline and that the company will be required to post additional collateral  reduce the amount borrowed or suffer forced sales of the collateral 
if forced sales were made at prices lower than the carrying value of the collateral  the company would experience additional losses 
if the company is forced to liquidate these assets to repay borrowings  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the reit asset and source of income requirements
