item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations azz incorporated the company operates two distinct segments  electrical and industrial products segment and galvanizing services segment 
the electrical and industrial products segment serves the power generation  transmission and distribution market as well as the industrial market 
the galvanizing services segment consists of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities located throughout the south and southwest united states that provides a value added galvanizing service to the steel fabrication industry 
management believes that the following commentary appropriately discusses and analyzes the comparative results of operations and the financial conditions of the company for the periods covered 
general for the fiscal year ended february   the company recorded record revenues of million compared to the prior year s revenues of million 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated from the electrical and industrial products segment and approximately were generated from the galvanizing services segment 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
net income as a percent of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the reduction in net income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower operating margins in the company s galvanizing services segment and the industrial products within the electrical and industrial products segment 
these lower margins were a result of the overall downturn of the general economy 
earnings per share decreased by to per share for fiscal compared to per share in the prior fiscal year  on a diluted basis

the segment recorded record revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of over the prior year results of million 
these results were aided by the acquisitions of central electric company and carter crawley inc on november  these acquisitions reinforce the company s strategy of broadening our range of products that we are able to offer to our existing customer base

the backlog excluding acquisitions increased to million for fiscal the electrical products backlog increased million to million 
approximately of the million increase is associated with the acquired companies  which ended fiscal with a backlog of million

increased demand for these products continued in fiscal as a result of the need for new power plants and the upgrading of existing power plants in order to supply economical and reliable electricity 
the company s prior year s expansions and acquisitions have enabled it to capitalize on the growth in the power industry market 
recent developments  which have impacted the capital markets funding for new projects  have caused delays and cancellations of domestic power plant construction planned for and beyond 
even though the current problems in the power generation industry tempers our short term optimism  the company believes the long term need to expand power generation capacity is a basic one that should resume once the capital markets are sorted out 
revenues for industrial products of the electrical and industrial products segment increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the growth was due to increased demand for petroleum products during the first half of fiscal the company was notified in the fourth quarter of fiscal that it was being replaced as a supplier of a product being offered to the automotive industry

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates that affect the reported value of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for the company s conclusions 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as the business and the economic conditions change 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements  but accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals for contingent liabilities and revenue recognition 
more information regarding significant accounting policies can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying value of the accounts receivables is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments 
the allowance is determined by historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  overall level of outstanding accounts receivables  information about specific customers with respect of their inability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accruals for contingent liabilities the amounts the company records for claims such as insurance recoverables  warranty and other contingent liabilities requires the company to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
the company uses past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results may be different than the company s estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for the galvanizing services segment upon completion of the galvanizing services or shipment of product 
revenue is recognized for the electrical and industrial products segment upon shipment of product or customer receipt of product  or based upon percentage of completion method as contract services are performed 
the extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion 
contract costs include direct labor and material  and certain indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are estimable 
the assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated
