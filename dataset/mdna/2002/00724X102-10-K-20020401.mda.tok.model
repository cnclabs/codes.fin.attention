item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by forward looking information due to factors discussed under item business elsewhere in this report 
overview we have devoted substantially all of our resources since we began our operations in november to the discovery and development of proprietary pharmaceutical products for the treatment of pain and the side effects that are caused by current pain treatments 
we are a development stage pharmaceutical company and have not generated any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and  since our inception  we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million through december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
we have five product candidates in phase i through phase iii clinical trials 
our revenues in the near term are expected to consist primarily of milestone payments on certain of our product candidates licensed to others for development 
these payments are dependent on continued successful development and achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones by licensees and will not  in any event  be material relative to our operating expenses 
in the event that our development efforts or those of our licensees result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates  we will generate revenues from sales of our products and from the receipt of royalties on sales of licensed products 
product revenues will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our product candidates 
we may also finance our future operations with a combination of equity offering  payments for strategic research and marketing arrangement 
we expect to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years 
research  development and clinical trial costs relating to product candidates will continue to increase 
manufacturing  marketing and sales costs will increase as we prepare for the commercialization of alvimopan which  assuming regulatory approval  we expect to occur in we intend to expand our marketing activities in and in preparation for the establishment of a marketing and sales force for our product candidates in the united states 
we may also rely on collaborations with pharmaceutical companies in the united states to market and sell certain of our product candidates 
in international markets  we intend to rely on collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to market and sell our product candidates rather than establish our own sales force 
the company believes that its current financial resources and sources of liquidity are adequate to fund operations through the third quarter of based on a level of research and development and administrative activities necessary to achieve its short term objectives 
during  the staff of the sec released a cautionary advice regarding critical accounting policies and practices 
the release defines critical policies and practices as items that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
due to the nature of our operations and our current stage of development  we do not believe that we currently face the complex or subjective judgments inferred by the staff in the advice 
as we progress in our development and move closer to product approval and commercial operation  we may face such issues which require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgment 
our practice of applying apb opinion no 
to account for our stock option plan rather than sfas no 
could be considered to fall within the realm of this cautionary advice 
had we applied sfas no 
our net loss allocable to common stockholders for the years ended december    would have been increased by approximately   and  respectively see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts with third party vendors to perform clinical trials and the manufacture of drug candidates 
the company recognizes these expenses based on the percentage of completion method to match the period in which they are incurred 
these contracts can be terminated by either party 
milestone payments  royalties and license fees we paid roberts laboratories inc  which merged with shire pharmaceuticals  plc  a total of  through december  for the exclusive worldwide license to alvimopan 
our license agreement with roberts requires us to make payments to roberts if and when two milestones are achieved 
roberts licensed the rights to alvimopan from eli lilly  and eli lilly consented to the assignment by roberts to us of roberts rights and obligations 
under the agreement with eli lilly  we will make a milestone payment to eli lilly if and when we receive fda approval to sell alvimopan 
we will be required to pay royalties to eli lilly and roberts on any sales of alvimopan 
under agreements with other institutions  we will reimburse those institutions for certain patent expenses incurred 
in the aggregate these payments are not material 
results of operations years ended december  and grant and license revenues 
our grant and license revenues were approximately million and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
revenues recognized for the year ended december  consisted of a milestone payment of  from an affiliate of glaxosmithkline   which is a portion of a deferred  license fee from the same affiliate   which was the remaining balance of the deferred license fee received from the same affiliate in july as a non refundable up front payment upon signing the agreement  which was recorded as revenue upon termination of all continuing involvement  a milestone payment of  from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
 which is a portion of the  license fee received from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd  on signing an agreement in april  and  from a portion of the small business innovation research sbir grants awarded by the national institutes of health nih in september revenue recognized for the year ended december  consisted of  which is a portion of the  license fee received from an affiliate of glaxosmithkline on signing an agreement in july  and  which is a portion of the deferred  license fee received from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
on signing an agreement in april the revenues from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
are being recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the patents that were licensed in that collaboration 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  costs of clinical trials  costs to manufacture drug candidates  stock based compensation  allocated and direct facility expenses and other research expenses 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increased costs associated with developing our product candidates and additional product candidates being researched as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased staffing levels 
for the twelve months ended december   the costs of conducting phase i and phase ii clinical trials  the expansion in the phase iii clinical trials and the costs of manufacturing the clinical trial materials for alvimopan increased by approximately million compared to the same period in laboratory costs increased by approximately million compared to the same period in in addition  we paid license fees of approximately million to arch development corporation and the national institutes of health in database services increased by approximately million in the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in personnel costs increased by approximately million compared to the same period in amortization of deferred stock based compensation expenses increased by approximately million in the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in an increase in other expenses  including office rent and office expense of approximately million  compared to the same period in resulted from an increase in office space because of additional personnel 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the twelve months ended december  from approximately million in the twelve months ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase is primarily due to approximately million of higher payroll expenses related to additional personnel  approximately million of higher amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense  approximately million of marketing expenses related to alvimopan  approximately million of investor and public relations expenses  approximately million of corporate legal fees  approximately million in consulting fees  and increases of approximately million for other expenses including insurance  office rent and office expense 
net interest income expense 
our interest income increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  due to the investment returns on the proceeds from our initial public offering in november and a follow on round of financing in may our interest expense represents interest incurred on the financing of insurance premiums 
net loss 
our net loss for the twelve months ended december  and was approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
the increase in the net loss reflects higher costs associated with the expansion of phase ii and phase iii clinical development of our product candidates  higher manufacturing costs for the clinical trial materials for alvimopan and increased staffing levels partially offset by higher revenues 
net loss allocable to common stockholders 
for the year ended december   the net loss allocable to common stockholders was approximately million  an amount equal to the net loss for the period 
for the same period in  the net loss allocable to common stockholders was approximately million and included a net loss of approximately million  a beneficial conversion feature on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of approximately million and undeclared dividends attributable to mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of approximately million 
therefore  the net loss allocable to common stockholders decreased by approximately million for the period ended december  compared to the same period in due to the non recurring items in years ended december  and grant and license revenues 
our grant and license revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues recognized for the year ended december  consisted of  which is a portion of the  license fee received from an affiliate of glaxosmithkline on signing that agreement in july  and  which is a portion of the  license fee received from santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
on signing that agreement in april revenue recognized for the year ended december  consisted of a portion of the  license fee received from the affiliate of the glaxosmithkline agreement signed in july these revenues were recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the patents that were licensed in those collaborations 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  costs of clinical trials  costs to manufacture drug candidates  stock based compensation and other research expenses 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the costs of developing our product candidates as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased staffing levels 
in the year  the costs of conducting phase i  phase ii and the initiation of phase iii clinical trial activities and the costs of manufacturing the clinical trial materials for alvimopan increased by approximately million compared to the same period in personnel costs increased by approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in amortization of deferred stock based compensation expenses increased by approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in however  clinical development costs for adl decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in because the affiliate of glaxosmithkline and santen became responsible for those costs 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million in the same period in  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to approximately million of higher amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense  approximately million for higher personnel expenses related to additional personnel and approximately million of expenses which were incurred in connection with our postponed initial public offering in april net interest income expense 
our interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  due to investment returns on the proceeds from the sale of our initial public offering in november and the sale of series g and h preferred stock in january and july  respectively 
our interest expense represents interest incurred on our equipment financing facility and the financing of insurance premiums 
net loss 
our net loss for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in the net loss reflects higher costs associated with the expansion of phase ii clinical development and manufacturing costs for alvimopan  increased staffing levels and costs for the postponed initial public offering 
net loss allocable to common stockholders 
our net loss allocable to common stockholders was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the same period of the increase of approximately million reflects the increase in the net loss of million  an increase in undeclared dividends and accretion of offering costs related to the convertible preferred stock of million and a beneficial conversion feature on series g and h mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of million and million  respectively 
beneficial conversion feature 
in january  we sold  shares of series g mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
in july  we sold  shares of series h mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
after evaluating the fair value of our common stock in contemplation of our initial public offering  we determined that the issuance of the series g and h mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock resulted in a beneficial conversion feature calculated in accordance with emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features 
because the shares of series g and h mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock were issued below the deemed fair value of our common stock  a beneficial conversion feature of million was reflected in calculating the net loss allocable to common shareholders for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  and working capital was approximately million 
from inception through december   net cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities since inception was approximately million for the acquisition of laboratory equipment  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures and office equipment  and million for net purchases of short term investments 
from inception through december   we financed our operations primarily from the net proceeds generated from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock  the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and the issuance of common stock in a follow on offering 
through december   we had received total net proceeds of approximately million from the sales of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
on november  and november   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of common stock  including the exercise of the over allotment option  from our initial public offering 
in may  we received net proceeds of approximately million in a follow on round of financing 
our capital expenditures in the year were approximately million 
we lease three corporate and research and development facilities and other equipment under operating leases expiring in october  may and october current total minimum annual payments under these leases are  for   for and  for research and development expenditures  including clinical trial expenses  are expected to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
we expect that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase in future periods as a result of the manufacturing scale up in anticipation of commercialization of our product candidates  assuming we receive the necessary regulatory approvals 
the initiation of commercial activities will require the hiring of additional staff to coordinate contract manufacturing services at multiple locations 
sales and marketing activities will require hiring and training of a sales and marketing staff in and as of december   we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of million upon the occurrence of certain future clinical and regulatory events under various agreements including our agreement with lilly 
we also intend to hire additional research and development  clinical and administrative staff 
our capital expenditure requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time required to file and process regulatory approval applications  the development of commercial manufacturing capability  the ability to obtain additional licensing arrangements  and the demand for our product candidates  if and when approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
in summary  the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations less than total year years years thereafter long term debt   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual research expenditures pursuant to such license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
future compensation expense relating to all options outstanding at december  is estimated to be approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
compensation expense relating to the non employee portion of options granted is subject to change each reporting period based upon changes in the fair value of our common stock  estimated volatility and the risk free interest rate until the non employee completes his or her performance under the option agreement 
we expect that we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund operations 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or to us 
we have used substantial amounts of cash to date and expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure  research and development activities and marketing activities 
we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through the third quarter of we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors that affect our research  development and sales and marketing activities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to continue developing our product candidates 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result  of among other factors  our inability to file and obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates  our inability to achieve commercial acceptance of our product candidates if approved  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  our inability to enter into new collaborative agreements and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce any patent claims or any intellectual property rights 
income taxes as of december  we had approximately  of federal and  of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in and  respectively  if not utilized 
in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to a million annual limitation 
at december   we also had approximately  of federal and  of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on our historical consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing intangibles as goodwill and reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements because we have no goodwill or intangible assets 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it occurred 
a retirement obligation is defined as one in which a legal obligation exists in the future resulting from existing laws  statutes or contracts 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a business segment as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how long lived assets that are used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
no later than the year beginning after december   and plan to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the new standard for assets held for sale or disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that the adoption of these provisions of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury and corporate securities  including commercial paper and corporate debt instruments 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  was million and the weighted average interest rate was approximately
