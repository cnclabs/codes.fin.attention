item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the fifth largest automotive supplier in the world 
our sales have grown rapidly from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the major sources of this growth have been new program awards and the implementation of a strategic acquisition plan to capitalize on supplier consolidation and globalization trends in the automotive industry 
our customers are the major automotive manufacturers  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  fiat  volkswagen  peugeot  renault  toyota and subaru 
our operations are directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production are cyclical and can be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions  labor relations issues and regulatory factors 
automotive production in north america and western europe declined in and is expected to decline further in in the fourth quarter of  we began to implement a restructuring plan to consolidate our operations and align our capacity and operations with existing market conditions 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded pre tax charges of million 
please refer to restructurings for a more detailed description of our restructuring plan 
in addition to overall automotive vehicle production  our operating results are being significantly impacted by the commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply products and the market share of our customers 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates accounted for approximately of our net sales in a loss of significant business from general motors or ford  or a decrease in business with respect to a significant automobile model  could significantly and negatively affect our operating results 
moreover  there is substantial and continuing pressure on suppliers from their automotive manufacturers to reduce costs while at the same time assuming greater responsibility for the design  development  engineering and integration of interior products 
our customers impose annual selling price reductions on most of the products we supply 
our profitability is significantly dependent on our ability to achieve cost reductions which offset or exceed these customer mandated price reductions 
for a more detailed description of other factors that have or may significantly impact our business  results of operations or financial condition  please refer to forward looking statements and risk factors 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were billion as compared to billion for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
lower global production volumes on existing programs  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the effect of our divestitures negatively impacted net sales by approximately billion  
billion and 
billion  respectively 
selling price reductions also contributed to the decline in net sales 
these factors were partially offset by new business 
gross profit and gross margin were billion and in as compared to billion and in excluding the impact of restructuring charges  gross profit and gross margin were billion and in the decrease is primarily the result of lower global production volumes and our divestitures  which contributed approximately million and million  respectively  to the decrease in gross profit

selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development  were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in as compared to in excluding the impact of restructuring charges  selling  general and administrative expenses were million and as a percentage of net sales in research and development costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods  to the extent not recoverable from the customer  are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses as incurred 
such costs amounted to approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses are net severance costs of approximately million related to actions in the first six months of to reduce our cost base 
approximately  employees in our worldwide workforce were terminated during this period

excluding these non recurring transactions  other expense was million for the year ended december  during  we recorded a net gain of million related to the sales of our sealants and foam rubber business and four plastic and metal manufacturing facilities as well as non recurring expenses  including the disposal of idle equipment  of million 
excluding these non recurring transactions  other expense was million for the year ended december  on an adjusted basis  the increase in other expense was primarily due to a recurring discount of approximately million related to the transfer of accounts receivable under the abs facility and an increase in foreign currency exchange losses

partially offsetting the increase were higher engineering costs  european start up expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development  as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of the integration of ut automotive in as well as additional expenses resulting from our acquisitions in during  the company recorded a credit of million comprised of unutilized restructuring reserves from the restructuring charge 
this credit was offset by a million charge to streamline certain corporate and division administrative office functions 
the costs were comprised entirely of severance and were substantially utilized by december  for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  as the result of debt incurred to finance acquisitions and increased interest rates under our primary credit facilities

restructurings in order to better align our operations and capacity in response to reductions in global automotive production volumes  in the fourth quarter of  we began to implement a restructuring plan 
this restructuring plan will consolidate our operations  provide operational efficiencies and improve our long term competitive position 
several of these actions involve the relocation of businesses to improve factory utilization 
we expect the net personnel reduction to be approximately  employees 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded pre tax charges of million  including million recorded as cost of goods sold and million recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
significant activities included in the restructuring plan are as follows consolidation of north and south american operations 
we have implemented a plan to consolidate certain manufacturing and administrative functions in north and south america 
as a result  ten manufacturing and three warehouse facilities in north america and three manufacturing facilities in south america will be closed 
the charges consist of severance costs of million for  employees notified prior to december   asset impairment charges of million  lease cancellation costs of million and other facility closure costs of million 
as of december   two of the manufacturing facilities were closed and of the employees had been terminated 
we also implemented a plan to consolidate certain administrative functions and to reduce the us salaried workforce 
we recorded a charge of million for severance costs for employees notified prior to december  as of december   of the employees had been terminated 
consolidation of european and rest of world operations 
we have implemented a plan to consolidate certain manufacturing and administrative functions in europe and rest of world 
as a result  five manufacturing facilities will be closed 
the charges consist of severance costs of million for  employees notified prior to december   asset impairment charges of million and other facility closure costs of million 
as of december   one of the facilities was closed and  of the employees had been terminated 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million for severance costs for  employees in one country under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  as we anticipate this to be the minimum aggregate severance payments that will be made in accordance with statutory requirements 
these employees are expected to be terminated in we also implemented a plan to consolidate certain administrative functions and to reduce the european salaried workforce 
we recorded a charge of million for severance costs for employees notified prior to december  as of december   two of the employees had been terminated 
in  we expect cash expenditures related to the restructuring plan to be approximately million 
we also expect to incur between and million of restructuring related capital expenditures during this time 
in  the savings realized as a result of the restructuring plan are expected to approximate and  as such  offset the restructuring related costs 
beginning in  we expect to realize between and million per year in savings as a result of the restructuring plan 
for more information relating to the restructuring charges described above  see note  restructuring and other charges  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a plan to streamline corporate and division administrative office functions 
as a result of these actions  we recorded pre tax charges of million  consisting entirely of severance to employees notified of their termination prior to december  as of december   all of the provision had been utilized 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our long term competitive position 
during and  we made adjustments to the original restructuring provision  resulting in net restructuring credits of million and million  respectively 
the adjustments were attributable to several factors  including severance benefits in excess of amounts originally accrued  reduced severance benefits due to employee reductions attained through attrition  sub lessor arrangements and decisions to delay or cancel certain actions 
additionally  during  we expensed as incurred million of employee and equipment relocation costs incurred in connection with the implementation of the restructuring plan 
the restructuring is complete  and the remaining accrual of million as of december  consists of long term lease payments related to closed european facilities 
ut automotive during the second quarter of  we began to implement restructuring plans designed to integrate the operations of the recently acquired ut automotive  which were finalized during the first and second quarters of as a result of these restructuring plans  we recorded an adjustment to the original purchase price allocation of million 
the plans called for the termination of employees  all of whom were terminated as of december   and the closure of or exit from five facilities  of which four were closed or vacated as of december  during the second quarter of  the closure of a european facility was cancelled due to a new program award in the region 
we had previously completed all restructuring actions related to this facility with the exception of the disposition of the building  which had been idle since july production on the new program began in january as a result  we reduced the restructuring accrual related to severance and goodwill by million 
liquidity and financial condition our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  service indebtedness and support working capital requirements 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and borrowing availability under our primary credit facilities 
a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
as a result  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and dividends and distributions or advances from these subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations 
there are no material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to lear 
cash flow cash flows from operating activities generated million  excluding the proceeds from sales of receivables under the abs facility  in as compared to million in proceeds from the sales of receivables under the abs facility were million in net income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease  recoverable customer engineering and tooling was a source of million in and million in  as recovery of previously capitalized amounts outpaced amounts incurred and capitalized in both years 
net cash used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in a decrease in capital expenditures from million in to million in was partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the disposition of businesses and other assets 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures for of approximately million 
capitalization we utilize uncommitted lines of credit to satisfy a portion of our short term working capital requirements 
for the years ended december  and  our average outstanding unsecured short term debt balances were million and million  respectively 
weighted average interest rates on the outstanding borrowings were and for the respective periods 
we utilize a combination of committed credit facilities and longer term notes to fund our capital expenditure and base working capital requirements 
for the years ended december  and  our average outstanding long term debt balances were billion and billion  respectively 
weighted average long term interest rates including rates under our committed credit facilities were and for the respective periods 
on march   we replaced our billion revolving credit facility in order to extend its maturity and reduce commitments 
as a result  interest rates and fees thereunder were adjusted to market rates 
in addition  we amended our other primary credit facilities at the same time 
our primary credit facilities currently consist of a billion amended and restated credit facility  which matures on march   a million revolving credit facility  which matures on may   and a million term loan  having scheduled amortization which began on october  and a final maturity on may  as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan 
our primary credit facilities provide for multicurrency borrowings in a maximum aggregate amount of up to million  the commitment for which is part of the aggregate primary credit facilities commitment 
the write off of deferred financing fees related to the billion revolving credit facility totaled approximately million 
million after tax  which is reflected as an extraordinary loss  net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  as of december   we had 
billion outstanding under our primary credit facilities and million committed under outstanding letters of credit  resulting in unused availability under our primary credit facilities of more than billion 
the weighted average interest rates across all currencies as of december  and were and  respectively 
our primary credit facilities provide for scheduled term loan repayments of million in  million in and million in in addition  scheduled cash interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are million in each of  and borrowings under our primary credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
therefore  an increase in interest rates would reduce our profitability 
see market risk sensitivity 
in addition to indebtedness under our primary credit facilities  we had approximately billion of debt  including short term borrowings  outstanding as of december   consisting primarily of billion of senior notes due between and and euro million approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect as of december  of senior notes due on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes due  yielding gross proceeds of million 
the notes are unsecured and rank equally with our other unsecured senior indebtedness  including our other senior notes 
each note of  principal amount at maturity was issued at a price of  representing a yield to maturity of 
holders of the notes may convert their notes at any time on or before the maturity date at a conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares of our common stock per note  provided that the average per share price of our common stock for the trading days immediately prior to the conversion date is at least a specified percentage  beginning at and declining each year thereafter to at maturity  of the accreted value of the note  divided by the conversion rate 
the notes are also convertible if the long term credit rating assigned to the notes by either moody s investors service  inc or standard poor s ratings group is reduced below ba or bb  respectively  or either ratings agency withdraws its long term credit rating assigned to the notes  if we call the notes for redemption or upon the occurrence of specified other events 
we have an option to redeem all or a portion of the convertible notes for cash at their accreted value at any time on or after february  holders may require us to purchase their notes on each of february   and  as well as upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  at their accreted value on such dates 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we used the proceeds from the convertible debt offering to repay indebtedness under the revolving portion of our primary credit facilities 
the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  or applicable state securities laws  and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration 
under the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we are required to file a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and the common stock issuable thereunder 
we would be required to pay additional interest on the notes in the event the registration statement is not filed or declared effective by specified dates and under certain other circumstances 
our primary credit facilities contain operating and financial covenants that  among other things  could limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital 
the primary credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our significant subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of all or a portion of the capital stock of certain of our significant subsidiaries 
our senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our primary credit facilities 
for more information concerning our long term debt  please refer to note  long term debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and to the agreements governing our material indebtedness  which have been filed as exhibits to this report 
on august   we redeemed our subordinated notes due the redemption was made at of the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on may   we redeemed our subordinated notes due the redemption was made at par 
the redemptions were financed through borrowings under our primary credit facilities 
the redemption premium and the write off of deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the subordinated notes due and the subordinated notes due totaled approximately million million after tax  which is reflected as an extraordinary loss  net of tax in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our scheduled maturities of long term debt as well as our lease commitments under noncancellable operating leases as of december  are as follows in millions thereafter total long term debt maturities operating lease commitments total in addition  we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to years 
prior to being formally awarded a program  we work closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering a vehicle s interior systems 
the failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle s interior systems  or to fulfill a customer s contract  could adversely affect our business 
in november  we entered into the abs facility which provides for maximum purchases of adjusted accounts receivable of million  of which million were purchased as of december  in november  the abs facility was amended to extend the termination date to november and to accommodate reductions in the credit ratings of our three largest customers  whose receivable are transferred to the abs facility  as well as recent declines in automotive production volumes 
as a result  our utilization of the abs facility in the future may be lower than in prior periods 
in addition  should our customers experience further reductions in their credit ratings  we may be unable to utilize the abs facility in the future 
should this occur  we would seek to utilize other available credit facilities to replace the funding currently provided by the abs facility 
during  our utilization of the abs facility versus other available credit facilities resulted in a savings of approximately million 
in addition  several of our european subsidiaries factor their accounts receivable with financial institutions subject to limited recourse provisions 
the amount of such factored receivables  which is not included in accounts receivable  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in march  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of our outstanding common stock over a month period 
in  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of 
in  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of 
we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock in we believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated debt service obligations  projected capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  our operating cash flows and borrowing availability are subject to the risks and uncertainties identified under overview  forward looking statements and risk factors 
market risk sensitivity in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with management s guidelines 
we enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange 
operating results may be impacted by our buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies transactional exposure 
we mitigate this risk by entering into foreign currency forward  swap and option contracts 
the foreign currency contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy 
the gains and losses relating to the foreign currency contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
any gain or loss incurred related to a foreign currency contract is generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions 
our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to mexico  canada and the european monetary union 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall currency rate exposure as of december  the potential adverse earnings impact from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies for calendar year is approximately million 
as of december   contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturities of less than one year 
the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts as of december  was approximately a positive million 
a change in exchange rates would result in a million change in market value 
there are certain shortcomings inherent to the sensitivity analysis presented 
the analysis assumes that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement 
in addition to the above transactional exposure  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign currency contracts to mitigate this exposure 
interest rates 
we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
our exposure to variable interest rates on outstanding floating rate debt instruments indexed to us or european monetary union short term money market rates is partially managed by the use of interest rate swap agreements to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
these interest rate derivative contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies that match the underlying debt instrument 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swaps are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income on an accrual basis 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall interest rate exposure as of december  this analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point parallel shift in interest rates at all points of the yield curve 
the potential adverse earnings impact from this hypothetical increase for calendar year is approximately million 
as of december   contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturity dates of march through may the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december  was approximately a negative million 
a basis point parallel increase in interest rates would increase the market value of these instruments by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates of the same magnitude would result in a million decline in market value 
additional information relating to our outstanding financial instruments is included in note  long term debt  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
other matters environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances  which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for the costs of cleaning up certain damages resulting from past spills  disposal or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain procedures to ensure compliance 
however  we have been  and in the future may become  the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous wastes at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in the ut automotive acquisition 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to possible environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of future operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and include pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
we incur pre production engineering  research and development er d and tooling costs related to the products produced for our customers under long term supply agreements 
prior to january   we capitalized these costs when reimbursable from the customer and amortized them over the term of the related supply agreement 
on january   we prospectively adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply agreements 
as a result  beginning january   we expensed all pre production er d costs for products to be supplied under long term supply agreements for which reimbursement was not contractually guaranteed by our customer 
in addition  we expensed all pre production tooling costs for products to be supplied under long term supply agreements related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement was not contractually guaranteed by our customer or for which the customer had not provided a noncancellable right to use the tooling 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production er d costs for products to be supplied under long term supply agreements for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by our customer 
in addition  during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production tooling costs for products to be supplied under long term supply agreements related to company owned tools as well as customer owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by our customer or for which our customer had provided a noncancellable right to use 
a change in the commercial arrangements affecting any of our significant programs that would require us to expense er d or tooling costs that we currently capitalize under eitf issue no 
could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues as our products are shipped to our customers 
we enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to years 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customer but not by us at any time  but in general are not 
in certain instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such product 
in such situations  we record a liability for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and are recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers 
losses are determined on a separate agreement basis and are estimated based upon information available at the time of the estimate  including future production volume estimates  the length of the program and selling price and production cost information 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the adequacy of the loss contract accruals recorded and make adjustments as necessary 
during  we recorded loss contract accruals in purchase accounting in conjunction with the lear donnelly acquisition  the ut automotive acquisition and the peregrine acquisition 
in addition  we had previously recorded a loss contract accrual in purchase accounting in conjunction with the delphi acquisition 
these loss contract accruals were not recorded in the historical operating results of lear donnelly  ut automotive  peregrine or delphi 
the losses included in the accrual have not been  and will not be  included in our operating results since the respective acquisition dates 
further  our future operating results will benefit from accruing these contract losses in the related purchase price allocations 
the following table summarizes the loss contract accrual activity related to these acquisitions in millions accrual at original dec 
 accrual adjustments utilized lear donnelly ut automotive peregrine delphi we utilized million  million and million of the loss contract accruals to offset losses in  and  respectively 
the estimated utilization of the aggregate loss contract accrual is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
generally  assets and liabilities subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers  loss contract accruals  warranty accruals  pension and other postretirement costs  plant consolidation and reorganization reserves  self insurance accruals  asset valuation reserves and accruals related to litigation and environmental remediation costs 
management does not believe that the ultimate settlement of any such assets or liabilities will materially affect our financial position or results of future operations

risk factors a decline in automotive sales would reduce our sales and could harm our profitability and thereby make it more difficult to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
our operations are directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production are cyclical and can be affected by the strength of a country s general economy 
in addition  automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
automotive production in north america and western europe has declined from million in to in and is expected to decline between and in this decline in automotive sales and production resulted in a decline in our business and profitability in our recent restructuring actions are intended to align our capacity with lower production levels 
significant deterioration beyond the expected production levels  however  could have a negative impact on our sales  net income and other results of operations 
the loss in business from a major customer or the discontinuation of a particular automobile model could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  which could make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates  the two largest automotive manufacturers in the world  together accounted for approximately of our net sales in a loss of significant business from general motors or ford could be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and leading to a decline in the value of our common stock 
although we have purchase orders from many of our customers  these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  renewable on a year to year basis  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
the loss of business with respect to a significant automobile model could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
in this regard  we have been notified by a significant customer that it intends to discontinue and relocate production of a particular vehicle model from europe to north america 
the discontinuation of this vehicle s production in europe could require us to write off non recoverable program costs and lead to a decline in our profitability 
we have  however  entered into commercial negotiations with the customer regarding these issues 
there is substantial and continuing pressure from automotive manufacturers to reduce costs  including costs associated with outside suppliers such as us 
no assurances can be given with respect to our ability to improve or maintain our profitability in light of these substantial and continuing pressures 
our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
as a result of our business strategy  which includes plans for continued global expansion of operations  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries 
international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  and export and import restrictions 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable but may have a material adverse effect on our business and our profitability  which would make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our major customers could materially reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
approximately of our employees  and a substantial number of employees of most of our customers  are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements 
virtually all of our unionized facilities in the united states and canada have a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facilities  with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of other collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements covering approximately one quarter of our unionized workforce of approximately  employees are scheduled to expire in a labor dispute involving us or any of our major customers  or the inability by us or any of our major customers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement covering a large number of employees upon its expiration  could materially reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely impact our business and profitability 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which may harm our financial condition and require us to use a significant portion of our cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations 
we have debt that is greater than our stockholders equity and a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to satisfy our debt obligations 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future 
for the year ended december   our consolidated interest expense was million 
our primary credit facilities provide for scheduled term loan repayments of million in  million in and million in therefore  a downturn in our business could limit our ability to make payments under our indebtedness 
our indebtedness could also increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to payments of our indebtedness  limit our ability to obtain other financing to fund future working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities as a result of various restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our main competitors that have less debt 
because a significant portion of our borrowings bear interest at variable rates  an increase in interest rates would reduce our profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
since a significant portion of our borrowings bear interest at variable rates  we will be vulnerable to increases in interest rates  which would reduce our profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
in addition  we may be able to incur additional variable rate indebtedness in the future 
we will depend upon cash from our subsidiaries and therefore  if we do not receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  it will be more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our revenue and operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  we will be dependent on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends and distributions or advances from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations 
our obligations under our primary credit facilities and senior notes are currently guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries  but such guarantees may be released under certain circumstances
