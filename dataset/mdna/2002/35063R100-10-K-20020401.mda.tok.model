item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those discussed in the sections entitled business research and development  business competition  business intellectual property  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in this document as well as in other documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by the company in fiscal year overview founded in  foundry designs  develops  manufactures and markets a comprehensive  end to end suite of high performance metro routers  gigabit ethernet layer and layer switches  and internet traffic management products for enterprises  educational institutions  government agencies  web hosting companies  application service providers asps  electronic banking and finance service providers  and internet service providers 
our product suite includes the netiron family of metro routers  fastiron family of ethernet edge switches  edgeiron layer ethernet switches  bigiron family of gigabit ethernet core switches and serveriron family of ethernet layer internet traffic management switches 
in june  we introduced the jetcore asic chipset family which consists of different asics that provide various combinations of or gigabit ethernet ports to deliver advanced switching and routing functionalities 
built on micron technology  the jetcore chipset represents the third major asic development from foundry in a four year span 
purpose built to meet the feature  performance and scalability needs of the high bandwidth enterprise  metro and internet networks  foundry s jetcore chipset is the foundation of foundry s next generation switching and routing platforms 
we expect to incorporate jetcore into our next generation product lines by the end of june we generated net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
for the fourth quarter ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
this is the first quarterly loss we have incurred since the quarter ended december  the net loss for the quarter was due to a sequential decrease in revenue as a result of a combination of factors  including an overall reduction in capital spending by our existing and potential customers  unfavorable economic conditions  and the transition to jetcore products which caused some customers to place orders for the new jetcore based products to be delivered in the first half of as a result of the challenging economic environment  we have and may continue to experience reduced demand for our products and heightened pricing pressure from our competitors 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded certain one time charges totaling million as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions 
these charges were comprised of million provision for excess and obsolete inventories specifically associated with the major product transition to jetcore based products  million for the write down of a note receivable from a stockholder  million for the write down of a minority investment for an other than temporary decline in value  million for facilities abandonment  million bad debt expense related to one specific customer  and million of other one time charges 
our gross margin for fiscal was adversely impacted by a decrease in revenue and increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventories as a result of the product transition and challenging economic environment 
additionally  due to a number of factors which are discussed in more detail below  our selling prices and gross margins have and may continue to decrease as a result of macro economic factors and our efforts to compete aggressively  reduce our inventory levels and maintain sales levels 
market and economic conditions continue to be challenging 
we have observed effects of the economic downturn in many areas of our business 
the current recession has had a material adverse effect on our business and on some of our existing and prospective customers  with a number of such customers substantially delaying or reducing their network expansion plans  restructuring or consolidating in order to remain competitive 
one such proposed merger currently in process may have significant implications for foundry 
our largest oem  hewlett packard has proposed a merger with compaq computer corp 
to restructure itself to focus on certain market sectors 
sales to hewlett packard accounted for  and of our net revenue for  and  respectively 
if this merger is approved by shareholders and if hewlett packard chooses to eliminate its networking division as it realigns its business  hewlett packard may discontinue its oem relationship with foundry  which will negatively impact our revenue 
irrespective of the merger  if hewlett packard chooses to reduce or terminate its relationship with foundry  our revenue and ability to market and sell our products to potential customers will be harmed 
the global economic slowdown has also caused varying decreases in revenue from certain geographic regions 
as a result  sales to certain countries or regions may continue to fluctuate 
we have also experienced some gross margin deterioration  asset impairments and increased inventory and accounts receivable provisions as a result of the economic downturn 
in response to the slowdown  the company has and continues to increase its efforts to reduce inventories and operating costs 
however  the uncertainty about the severity and duration of the current recession continues to impair the company s ability to project its revenue in the near future 
if economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in economic conditions  we may continue to experience material adverse effects on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in order to be profitable we must maintain reasonable cost and expense levels while generating and sustaining higher revenue to cover costs and achieve profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases their estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in past years and for fiscal  we derived or more of our revenue from sales of our stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from customer support fees  training and installation services 
foundry s revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
specifically  foundry recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recorded at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  unless we have future obligations for installation or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is not recorded until such obligations have been satisfied or customer acceptance has been received 
for example  revenue is not recognized when the customer has a right of return or when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products 
at the time revenue is recognized  foundry establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with its sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
foundry s standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale and our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
foundry also provides a reserve for estimated customer returns 
in  and  foundry recorded a provision for sales returns equal to million  million and million  respectively  which has been netted against revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and return policies 
sales to foundry s resellers do not provide for rights of return and the contracts with foundry s original equipment manufacturers do not provide for rights of return except in the event foundry s products do not meet specifications or there has been an epidemic failure  as defined in the agreements 
if the historical data used by the company to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
in addition  if the company s actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  cost of revenues will increase in the future 
revenue from customer support services is recognized ratably over the contractual period  generally one year 
amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized on support contracts are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue from customer support services accounted for  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue for training and installation services is recognized as services are rendered 
revenue from software  training and installation services  combined  accounts for less than of total revenue for   and inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next three months 
in recent quarters  demand for our products has been adversely affected as a result of the current recession and reduced telecommunications and infrastructure capital spending  particularly in the united states 
as demonstrated during fiscal  a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
consequently  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the amounts of million  million  and million were recorded for the years ended december    and  respectively 
inventory write offs were approximately million in  million in  and million in although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated our cost of revenue in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
accounts receivable we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider our agreement with ge capital formerly heller financial corp  our third party leasing partner  which allows ge capital a right of recourse against foundry for defaults by customers financed through ge capital based on certain criteria 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asian region to secure lines of credit prior to placing an order with us 
during the year ended december   foundry provided approximately million to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts to a level deemed necessary by management to provide for potential uncollectible amounts 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
if the historical data used by the company to calculate the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts does not properly reflect future bad debts  net income could be overstated 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management makes an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
for fiscal and  we did not record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believe the amount is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event foundry is unable to realize some or all of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
purchase commitments we currently subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to two companies located in san jose  california 
celestica assembles and tests our printed circuit boards  and sanmina corporation assembles and tests our backplane products 
our agreements with sanmina and celestica allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by foundry with lead times of up to months 
foundry is contractually obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory procured by our contract manufacturers in accordance with the forecast  unless foundry gives notice of order cancellation at least to days prior to the delivery date 
as of december   the company was committed to purchase approximately million of such inventory over the next four months 
if actual demand of our products is below the projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
this would be recorded as additional provisions for excess inventory as a component of cost of revenue 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us as indicated in item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue  net cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation 
total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income write down of minority investment income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue 
net revenue was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing an increase of from fiscal to and a decrease of from to the increase from to was due to a strong market demand for internet infrastructure equipment  increased acceptance of foundry s product offerings  and a significant increase in foundry s sales and marketing organizations  all of which contributed to higher revenues in the decline in revenue in reflected the effects of the global economic slowdown  a reduction in capital spending by our existing and potential customers and  to a lesser extent  the product transition to jetcore asics which caused some of our customers to place orders for new jetcore based products to be delivered in the first half of for the year ended december   sales to america online and hewlett packard accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  no customer accounted for greater than of our revenue 
customer support revenue was  and of our net revenue for  and  respectively 
revenue from support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period  generally months 
the increases in support revenue were due to the associated increase in product sales in and our increased customer base  resulting in new customer support contracts in addition to support contract renewals by existing customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs and the provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
cost of revenue was million  million  and million in fiscal   and or   and of revenue  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue from to was primarily a result of shifts in product mix and lower manufacturing overhead costs due to higher sales volume 
the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue from to was due to a decline in sales volume and average selling prices resulting from the global economic slowdown  and increased inventory provision in response to the deteriorating economic environment and a major product line transition in the fourth quarter of the provision for excess and obsolete inventories increased from million in to million in  of which million was recorded in fourth quarter to specifically reserve for excess inventories as a result of our product realignment and transition from our ironcore asics based product lines to the new and more powerful products incorporating our next generation jetcore asics 
our gross margin has been and may continue to be adversely affected by heightened price competition  component shortages  increases in material or labor costs  changes in channels of distribution  product and geographic mix  as well as the mix of configurations within each product group 
downward pressures on our gross margins may be further impacted by increased percentage of revenue from service market providers  international purchasers or through our oems  all of which may have lower margins  or an increase in product costs 
see also risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we expect our gross margin to decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype expenses related to the development of our asics  software development and testing costs  and the depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or   and of revenue  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel from in to in to in and increased expenditures on the design and development of new products  particularly the development of our next generation jetcore asics in research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  promotional expenses and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to significant increases in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions  additional marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products  the expansion of distribution channels  and general corporate branding 
the increase from to was primarily due to increases in the average size of our direct sales force from in to in  and increased marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities  bad debt  legal  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to an increase in headcount from to and an increase in general corporate expenses consistent with the increased scale of operations and revenue growth 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars from to primarily due to certain charges such as million for the write down of a note receivable from a stockholder and million of costs related to facilities consolidation  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable from million in to million in as a result of the impact of the deteriorating economy on our customer base  and an increase in general corporate expenses such as legal and facilities costs 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and a director  we recorded deferred stock compensation in the aggregate amount of million in  and million in  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
we recorded no additional deferred stock compensation in deferred stock compensation is reflected within stockholders equity and is being amortized to operations over the respective vesting periods 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million remaining to be amortized in and interest income 
interest income is earned on funds we keep on deposit in interest bearing money market and short term investment accounts 
foundry had interest income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income increased significantly from to due to higher cash balances resulting from the proceeds from our initial public offering on october  interest income decreased from to due to lower interest rates during write down of minority investment 
in february  foundry made a million minority investment in a development stage private company  who is also a customer 
in december  the company determined that the investment declined in fair market value on an other than temporary basis based on certain factors such as the value of the most recent round of financing  market and industry conditions and financial condition of and business outlook for the company 
accordingly  foundry wrote down the minority investment in its entirety in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  income taxes 
the company generated significant taxable income in   and management believes that the company will likely generate sufficient taxable income in the future to ensure the realization of the tax benefits arising from its existing deferred tax assets 
therefore  no valuation allowance was required as of december   and the company s income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
these benefits were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
benefits reducing taxes payable amounted to approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
benefits increasing gross deferred tax assets amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   foundry had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as compared to million at december   an increase of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to was due primarily to the significant increase in net income combined with an income tax benefit realized from stock option exercises totaling million  offset by purchases of inventories and increase in accounts receivables 
cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for as a result of significantly lower net income in  lower tax benefit from stock option exercises  a significant increase in deferred tax assets offset by increases in the provisions for doubtful accounts and excess and obsolete inventories 
cash utilized in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to purchases of short term investments offset by proceeds received from the maturities of held to maturity investments 
financing activities in provided million  arising primarily from proceeds from our initial public offering on october  financing activities in provided million primarily from stock option exercises and  to a lesser extent  the collection of stockholder promissory notes 
during  we utilized million for financing activities  which comprised primarily of million used for the repurchase of foundry common stock in the open market offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises and sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had inventory purchase commitments to our contract manufacturers totaling million and operating lease commitments totaling million 
we may incur higher capital expenditures in the near future  when market conditions improve and if we expand our operations 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  from time to time  we may also consider the acquisition of products and businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investments may require additional capital 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
key factors impacting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital  in particular inventory and accounts receivable  as well as future demand for our products and related pricing 
recently issued accounting standards see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
we generated net income of million and million for the year ended december  and on revenues of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
although we have been profitable on an annual basis for the last three consecutive years  we incurred a net loss of million for the fourth quarter ended december  this is our first quarterly operating loss since the quarter ended december  when economic conditions improve  we may incur increased costs and expenses related to sales and marketing  including expansion of our direct sales operation and distribution channels  product development  customer support  expansion of our corporate infrastructure  and facilities expansion 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could cause a significant decline in our quarterly operating results 
in order to be profitable  we must generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the current economic downturn may continue to adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have and may continue to fluctuate due to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the communications and networking industries 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of the current recession and reduced capital spending  particularly in the united states 
the downturn has also contributed to declines in revenue during we have also experienced gross margin declines  reflecting the effect of competitive pressures as well as writedowns for inventories and other asset impairments as a result of the downturn 
our general and administrative expenses were higher than expected due in part to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and write down of a note receivable from a stockholder 
we are uncertain about the extent  severity  and length of the economic downturn 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material negative effects on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may not meet quarterly financial expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  especially in recent periods  and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
delays in generating or recognizing forecasted revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  demand for our products may fluctuate as a result of seasonality  particularly in europe 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
therefore  we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may negatively affect our operating results 
our reseller agreements typically provide that the reseller may delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
further  our customer purchase orders and reseller agreements sometimes provide that the customer or reseller may cancel orders within specified time frames without significant penalty 
terrorist acts and acts of war may harm our business and operating results 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc on september  have disrupted commerce throughout the world and have intensified the uncertainty of the us and global economies 
the long term effects on our business from these attacks are unknown 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat may cause further disruption to the economy 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although our customer base has increased substantially  we still depend on large  recurring purchases from certain customers  and any loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively impact our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  no customers accounted for greater than of our net revenue 
this may not necessarily be indicative of future customer concentrations 
although our customer base has become less concentrated  the loss of continued orders from our more significant customers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
while our financial performance may depend on large  recurring orders from certain customers and resellers  we do not generally have binding commitments from them 
for example 
our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  
our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time  
our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements  and 
our reseller agreements provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from a small number of customers 
financial results for any particular period will not predict results for future periods 
because of the uncertain nature of the economic environment and rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
in the future  our revenue may remain flat  decrease or grow at a slower rate 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase if we expand our sales and marketing operations and as we continue to develop new products 
further  we are subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their non qualified stock options 
the employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee s gain  which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material depending on the number of stock options exercised and the fair market value of our common stock during such period 
these employer payroll taxes would be recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees 
in addition to the net proceeds we would receive upon the exercise of stock options  we would receive tax deductions for gains realized by employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital 
however  because we are unable to predict our future stock price and the number of optionees who may exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict what  if any  expense will be recorded in a future period and the impact on our future financial results 
intense competition in the market for network solutions could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the market for network solutions is intensely competitive 
in particular  cisco systems inc maintains a dominant position in this market and several of its products compete directly with our products 
we also compete with other large public companies  such as nortel networks and enterasys networks as well as other smaller public and private companies such as juniper networks  extreme networks and riverstone networks 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater market leverage  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  more name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
additionally  we may face competition from unknown companies and emerging technologies that may offer new lan  man and lan wan solutions to enterprises and isps 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic relationships that would enable them to offer  or bring to market earlier  products that are superior to ours in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
in order to remain competitive  we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products with superior performance at lower prices than our competitors 
we must also enhance our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenue and profitability could suffer 
our ability to increase our revenue depends on expanding our direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels and continuing to provide excellent customer support 
if we are unable to effectively expand  train and retain our sales and support staff or establish and cultivate relationships with our indirect distribution channels  our ability to grow and increase revenue could be harmed or if our resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
some of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with adequate sales  marketing and technical support 
in an effort to gain market share and support our customers  we may expand our direct sales operation and customer service staff to support new and existing customers 
the timing and extent of any such expansion is uncertain in light of the current economic environment 
expansion of our direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels may not be successfully implemented and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenue generated 
we must continue to introduce new products with superior performance in a timely manner in order to sustain and increase our revenue 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
therefore  we need to introduce new products in a timely manner that offer substantially greater performance and support a greater number of users per device  all at lower price points to remain competitive 
the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to develop or obtain important intellectual property and accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to forecast sales volumes and quickly manufacture a sufficient mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  all at low costs 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
in june  we introduced jetcore  our third generation of asics which will be incorporated within our existing product lines by the end of march the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products  replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
in addition  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
during the development of our products  we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
some of our customers depend on the continued growth of the internet for all or substantially all of their revenue 
if the internet does not expand as expected  our business will be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
spending on internet infrastructure has increased significantly over the past several years based upon the growth of the internet 
there can be no assurance that spending on internet infrastructure will continue at these historical rates 
as a result of the recent economic decline  spending on internet infrastructure has decreased significantly  which has had a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure or if the internet does not continue to expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial marketplace  the growth of the market for internet infrastructure equipment may not continue and the demand for our products could be harmed 
our revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction in outside financing made available to our emerging company customers 
our customer base includes emerging enterprise  telecommunications and internet companies who rely on venture capital firms  banks and other similar financing sources to fund their operations and growth 
due to the slowdown of the economy and other factors  many of these customers have and may experience cash flow problems and are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms  if at all 
some of these companies have been unable to raise adequate capital and have reduced or ceased their purchases of our products and some have been unable to pay or have delayed payment for products they had previously purchased 
the inability of some of our existing and prospective customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect the timing of revenue recognition and such reductions in spending or payment defaults by this segment of our customer base have had and may have an adverse effect on our operating results and stock price 
our gross margin may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
our industry has experienced rapid erosion of average product selling prices due to a number of factors  particularly competitive and macroeconomic pressures and rapid technological change 
the average selling prices of our products has decreased and may continue to decrease in response to competitive pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
both we and our competitors sometimes lower sales prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
furthermore  as a result of the recent disruption in the technology sector coupled with more broad macro economic factors  both we and our competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain sales levels 
such intense pricing competition could cause our gross margins to decline and may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our gross margins may be further affected if we are unable to reduce manufacturing costs and effectively manage our inventory levels 
although management continues to closely monitor inventory levels  declines in demand for our products could result in additional provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
additionally  our gross margins may be affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs  the mix of product configurations sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
for example  we generally realize higher gross margins on direct sales to the end user than on sales through resellers or our oems 
as a result  any significant shift in revenue through resellers or our oems could harm our gross margins 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced  gross margin may also be adversely affected 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
if we are unable to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for these personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have experienced some difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly engineers 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success depends on bobby r 
johnson  jr  president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our personnel 
our expansion in international markets will involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
as a result  our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully address these risks 
our success will depend  in part  on increasing international sales and expanding our international operations 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  including pan dacom and total network solutions in europe  mitsui in japan  shanghai gentek  gti and utstarcom in china and samsung in korea 
although we expect international revenue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue  the failure of our resellers to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in particular  our revenue from japan depends on mitsui s ability to sell our products and on the strength of the japanese economy  which has been weak in recent years 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including 
potential recessions in economies outside the united states  
longer accounts receivable collection cycles  
seasonal reductions in business activity  
higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  
difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  
difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  
political instability and export restrictions  
potential adverse tax consequences  and 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on its business  operating results and financial condition 
generally  our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive on a price basis in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
we purchase several key components for our products from single or limited sources  if these components are not available  our revenues may be harmed 
we currently purchase several key components used in our products from single or limited sources and depend on supply from these sources to meet our needs 
our principal suppliers of key components include celestica  texas instruments  sanmina  finisar  hewlett packard  intel  fujitsu  samsung and qcs limited 
the inability of our suppliers to provide us with adequate supplies of key components or the loss of any of our suppliers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our principal limited sourced components include dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  asics  printed circuit boards  optical components  microprocessors and power supplies 
we acquire these components through purchase orders and have no long term commitments regarding supply or price from these suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages in allocations of components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we may encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future which could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
we depend on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for single or limited sourced materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
if orders do not match forecasts or if we do not manage inventory effectively  we may have either excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we currently subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to two companies located in san jose  california 
celestica assembles and tests our printed circuit boards  and sanmina corporation assembles and tests our backplane products 
our agreements with sanmina and celestica allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by foundry with lead times of up to months 
foundry is contractually obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory procured by our contract manufacturers in accordance with the forecast  unless foundry gives notice of order cancellation at least to days prior to the delivery date 
if actual demand of our products is below the projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
we do not have long term contracts with either of these manufacturers 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our contract manufacturers  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we attempt to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  the loss of either of our contract manufacturers  or the ability to obtain raw materials  could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of our products  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and may cause us to miss our revenue expectations 
some of our products have a relatively high sales price  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by a customer 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on their internal budgets and procedures involving rigorous evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle in these situations can be as long as months and may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may not meet our revenue expectations 
the timing of the adoption of industry standards may negatively impact widespread market acceptance of our products 
our success depends in part on both the adoption of industry standards for new technologies in our market and our products compliance with industry standards 
many technological developments occur prior to the adoption of the related industry standard 
the absence of an industry standard related to a specific technology may prevent market acceptance of products using the technology 
for example  we introduced gigabit ethernet products in may  over a year prior to the adoption of the industry standard for this technology 
we intend to develop products using other technological advancements  such as gigabit ethernet  mpls draft martini  and may develop these products prior to the adoption of industry standards related to these technologies 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
further  we may develop products that do not comply with the eventual industry standard  which could hurt our ability to sell these products 
if the industry evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion that meet these new standards 
even after industry standards are adopted  the future success of our products depends upon widespread market acceptance of their underlying technologies 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new enhancements and versions are released 
despite our testing procedures  these defects and errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendors products could result in 
negative customer reactions  
product liability claims  
negative publicity regarding us and our products  
delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  
product returns  
lost sales  and 
unexpected expenses to remedy errors 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we experienced rapid growth from to which placed a significant strain on our resources 
our revenue increased significantly during those years  and our headcount increased from employees in to in our headcount grew  at a much slower rate  to employees in we may make mistakes in operating our business  such as inaccurately forecasting our sales  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
to accommodate anticipated growth  we must 
improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  
hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  and 
effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties 
our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
during the second quarter of  we completed the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system to meet the needs associated with the growth of our operations 
as our international operations grow  we will need to expand our support and communications infrastructure overseas as well 
any delay in the implementation of or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our products may not meet the legal foreign and international standards required for their sale  which will harm our business 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
although our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries we currently sell to  there is no assurance that our existing and future product offerings will continue to comply with evolving standards and regulations 
if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or maintaining profitability 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could result in the dilution of our stockholders  cause us to incur substantial expenses and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
although foundry continues to focus on internal product development and growth  we may review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities as part of our business strategy 
future acquisitions by us could result in large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could negatively affect our results of operations 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of products  operations  personnel and technologies of the acquired companies  
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
although we do not currently have any agreements or plans with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we may need to raise more capital  but the availability of additional financing is uncertain 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash from future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock 
the terms of debt securities could impose restrictions on our operations and could cause our stock price to decline 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and know how 
our proprietary technology includes our asics  our ironcore and jetcore hardware architecture  and our ironware software 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights in these proprietary technologies 
we do not own any patents although we do have patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
we provide software to customers under license agreements included in the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in some foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  some companies in the networking markets have extensive patent portfolios with respect to networking technology 
as a result of the existence of a large number and rapid rate of issuance of new patents in the networking industry  it is not economically practical for a company of our size to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent rights of others 
from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent  copyright and trademark rights to technologies and related standards that are important to us 
such third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products 
in march  nortel filed a lawsuit against foundry in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that certain of the company s products infringe several of nortel s patents and seeking injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages 
nortel has also brought suit  on the same or similar patents  against a number of other networking companies 
foundry has analyzed the validity of nortel s claims and believes that nortel s suit is without merit 
foundry is committed to vigorously defending itself against these claims 
irrespective of the merits of the company s position  we may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims 
in the event of a determination adverse to the company  the company could incur substantial monetary liability  and be required to change its business practices 
either of these could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our stock price has been volatile historically  which may make it more difficult to resell shares when needed at attractive prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
during the year ended december   the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market ranged from to 
during the year ended december   the closing sale prices of our common stock ranged from to 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
additionally  volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
we face litigation risks 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us as indicated in item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
management beneficially owns approximately of our stock  their interests could conflict with yours  significant sales of stock held by them could have a negative effect on foundry s stock price 
foundry s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result of their ownership and positions  our directors and executive officers collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of foundry 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by foundry s directors and executive officers  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of foundry s common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of foundry without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of foundry  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  other catastrophic event  or power shortages 
our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  our headquarters and contract manufacturers are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in recent years  the western united states and california in particular has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  our contractors facilities and certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
as a result of this energy crisis  these contractors may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or they may increase their service fees 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our independent auditor  arthur andersen llp  has been indicted by the united states department of justice  creating uncertainties for the company in making its sec filings 
on march   the united states department of justice obtained an indictment against arthur andersen llp  the company s auditors 
the indictment raises a number of uncertainties for the company 
the sec has announced that it will continue to accept financial statements audited by andersen in its sec filings  as long as companies obtain certain financial representations from andersen concerning audit quality controls for audit reports issued after march  however  if andersen is convicted  the sec may bar andersen from doing public company audit work  or may refuse to accept financial statements audited by andersen in future sec filings 
if financial statements audited by andersen are no longer accepted by the sec  we would have to seek another auditing firm 
the number of auditing firms in the united states with staffing and capabilities similar to andersen s is limited 
if financial statements audited by andersen are no longer accepted by the sec  it is likely that many public companies will be seeking alternative auditors at the same time 
we may experience difficulties in obtaining a satisfactory alternative auditor  and the cost of obtaining the annual audit may increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foundry s investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or fund 
a hypothetical basis point decline in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized earnings on our million of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  by approximately million 
with the exception of a high risk million minority investment made in a development stage private company  who is also our customer  in february  our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with original maturities of less than one year and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
in december  the company wrote off the minority investment as it was determined that the investment had declined in value and that the decline was other than temporary 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
currently  all of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of canada s operations denominated in canadian dollars  and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures
