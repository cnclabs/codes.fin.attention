overview novavax is a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products utilizing our proprietary drug delivery and vaccine technologies for large and growing markets  concentrating on the areas of women s healthcare and infectious diseases 
our lead product candidate  estrasorb  is the first transdermal lotion for estrogen replacement therapy for which a new drug application has been accepted for filing by the food and drug administration 
the new drug application for estrasorb was submitted in june and was accepted for filing in august we 
table of contents are seeking fda approval of estrasorb for the reduction of hot flashes in menopausal women and  if approved  we believe estrasorb will be competitively positioned to address the billion estrogen replacement therapy market in the united states 
in our phase ii and iii clinical trials  women using estrasorb experienced a statistically significant reduction in the number of hot flashes  the primary endpoint of our study  with many women reporting a total elimination of hot flashes while using the product 
we also believe that estrasorb offers additional advantages over other estrogen replacement therapies  including ease of use  more rapid onset of estrogen therapy and a lower incidence of skin irritation and nausea 
our drug delivery technologies involve the use of our patented oil and water emulsions which we believe can be used as vehicles for the transdermal and injectable delivery of a wide variety of drugs and other therapeutic products  including hormones  anti bacterial and anti viral products and vaccine adjuvants  which are substances added to vaccines to enhance their effectiveness 
we believe that our technologies represent the first time that alcohol soluble hormones  such as estrogen and testosterone  have been encapsulated and delivered through the skin 
in addition to estrasorb  our product candidates using these technologies include androsorb  a transdermal testosterone lotion that is in phase ii clinical trials  andro ject  a long acting subcutaneous injectable formulation of testosterone that is in preclinical development  and a transdermal progestin lotion that is also in preclinical development 
we also conduct research and development on preventative and therapeutic vaccines for a variety of infectious diseases 
in december  we acquired privately owned fielding pharmaceutical company fielding  based in st 
louis  missouri  which sells  markets and distributes a proprietary line of pharmaceutical products focused on women s health 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired of fielding for million

the amended agreements grant king exclusive rights to promote  market and distribute estrasorb in canada  and five additional countries in europe  and added androsorb  a topical testosterone replacement therapy for testosterone deficient women 
we feel this partnership has the potential to provide us with deeper penetration into the women s healthcare market for estrasorb and androsorb 
under the terms of the amended agreements we received million from king in up front licensing fees  and we will also receive additional milestone payments of million upon estrasorb s approval in canada and million upon the first approval of estrasorb in one of the five additional countries in europe

table of contents significant accounting policies and changes to accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified below some of our more significant accounting policies and changes to accounting policies 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see footnote summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  whereby revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
up front payments and licensing fees are deferred and recognized as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment  net of allowances for returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals  which have reached their expiration date 
revenues from the sale of scientific prototype vaccines and adjuvants are recorded as the products are shipped 
revenues earned under research contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method as described in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the extent of progress toward completion is measured on the cost to cost method 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made 
advertising and promotion costs all costs associated with advertising and promotion is expensed as incurred 
advertising and promotion expense  including samples  was million in prior to  we incurred no material advertising or promotional expenses 
our advertising and promotion expenses will substantially increase in as we prepare for the anticipated approval and subsequent launch of estrasorb 
if the approval of estrasorb is delayed we will be able to defer some  but not all  of the expenses related to this product launch 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we continue to expand our product development activities in our women s healthcare and infectious disease programs 
our research and development costs have  and will continue to include expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and filings  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
goodwill and intangibles assets goodwill and intangible assets principally result from business acquisitions 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combination  and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of we will begin to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  and have not yet determined what the effect these test may have on our earnings and financial position 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended was approximately million and will no longer be recorded subsequent to december  future accounting for co promotion agreement in we anticipate marketing and selling estrasorb in the territory 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement with king we will record all of the product sales  returns and allowances and cost of sales for estrasorb 
the resultant gross margin will be shared equally with king and the payment to king will be recorded as a selling and marketing expense on our statement of operations 
in the co promotion agreement both parties will also share equally in committee approved marketing expenses for the products 
all direct marketing expenses will be recorded by us  for which king will reimburse us fifty percent 
the following is a discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in item to this report 
results of operations for the years ended  and revenues revenues for the year ended were million compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of million or from to  and an increase of million or from to the increase from to relates primarily to million from products sales related to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line  million for one time milestone payments from king for the timely submission and acceptance of our estrasorb new drug application by the fda  and  for license fees 
in addition to our new revenue sources  we recorded million from research and development contracts  primarily from the national institutes of health and other governmental agencies 
revenues for included  in license fees from king and million from research and development contracts  including million for contracts with the nih and other government agencies 
in  our revenues included  from a license agreement with king and  from contracts with the nih and other governmental agencies 
a summary of our revenues is set forth below 
product sales contract research and development milestone and licensing fees total revenue net losses net loss for was million or per share  compared to million or per share for and million or per share in the improvement from to of million or per share relates primarily to gross margin on product sales due to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line and milestone revenue for payments from king  offset in by additional selling  general and administrative costs to support those product sales  the initiation of commercialization activities for estrasorb 
table of contents and additional research and development costs 
the increase in losses from to of million or per share resulted from additional general and administrative costs associated with financing and acquisitions activities  the hiring of additional senior management and personnel to support our growth and increases in research and development expenses primarily due to costs associated with our clinical trials and manufacturing process validation activities related to our estrasorb product candidate 
cost of sales cost of sales was million in we had no product sales or cost of sales in or the increase relates to the acquisition of products from fielding and the avc product line in december and january  respectively 
our cost of sales  and related investment in inventory  will increase in as we prepare for the anticipated launch of estrasorb 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for  compared to million for and million in the increase from to of million or was primarily due to costs associated with the filing of a new drug application for estrasorb and for internal development costs associated with our infectious diseases programs offset by a decrease in clinical trial expenses 
the increase from to of million or was primarily due to costs associated with our clinical trials and manufacturing process validation of our estrasorb product candidate  which completed phase iii clinical trials in  and the full year effect of expenses incurred by our vaccine development group which was acquired in late we generally do not track our historical research and development total costs by project  rather  we track external direct costs incurred by project 
internal direct costs  such as labor in addition to overhead costs are not tracked by project 
for this reason  we cannot accurately estimate with any degree of certainty what our historical costs have been for any particular research and development project 
reconciliation of significant research and development projects the following table reconciles the external direct costs incurred to date for our major projects to our total research and development expense 
project estrasorb external cost infectious disease vaccines direct costs other costs labor overhead total estimated cost and time to complete major projects the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   several of our proprietary product candidates were in various stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of our development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for several of our products 
however  due to the late stage status of our estrasorb project we 
table of contents believe that the duration and estimated cost to complete is reasonably predictable 
we have included that information in the following table 
estimated estimated current development completion project status costs dates estrasorb nda filed million in addition to the project listed above we are currently developing other product candidates  but do not believe that it is possible to estimate the completion date or cost to complete 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products in numerous pre clinical studies to identify among other things the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risk and uncertainties and our liquidity  see risks and uncertainties and liquidity and capital resources 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million for prior to our acquisition of fielding and the avc product line in and  respectively  and the anticipated approval of estrasorb we had no sales or marketing expense 
in  we incurred million of selling expenses and million of marketing costs to support our current product sales  as well as pre launch marketing expense for our anticipated launch of estrasorb 
we expect selling and marketing costs to increase substantially with the commercialization of estrasorb in in addition  all payments made to king in connection with the co promotion of estrasorb will be recorded as selling and marketing expenses in our statement of operations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase from to of million or was due to a number of factors  including approximately million of goodwill and intangible asset amortization related to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line  the increase in personnel from the fielding acquisition  and the full effect of increases in administrative and executive employees hired during to support our growth 
the increase from to of million or was due primarily to costs incurred for financing and acquisition activities and the hiring of additional senior management and personnel to support our growth 

table of contents interest income expense net interest expense was  in compared to interest income  in and  in the increase in the interest expense relates to the issuance of the notes  totaling million to king  offset by additional interest income from higher cash balances during compared to the increase in the interest income in relates to higher average cash balances from financing activities during compared to liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the commercialization of our product candidates  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
we plan to have multiple products in various stages of product development and we believe our research and development as well as selling  marketing and general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to increase 
future activities including clinical development  the establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and the development of sales and marketing programs are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners 
from through december  we have financed our operations primarily from the private placement of  shares of common stock in with net proceeds of approximately million  the private placement of  shares of common stock in with net proceeds of approximately million  proceeds of approximately million in and from issuance of the notes to king for details on these transactions  refer to our discussion in the overview section above  proceeds of million from king in from licensing fees and milestone payments for details on these transactions  refer to our discussion in the overview section above  and net proceeds of million from through from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  we invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
the million increase in was due to million of financing activities from the issuance of million of convertible notes and the exercise of million in options and warrants  offset by our investments in capital equipment of million and in the avc product line of million and cash used in operations of million 
of the net million used in operations  we used approximately million to fund the activities of our research and development programs and costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  clinical testing and manufacturing process validation 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the cash flow activities above and the increase in accounts receivable of million  offset by an increase in current liabilities of million 
we estimate that based on historical and projected levels of spending and revenues  and without giving effect to any future equity financing  existing cash resources will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for approximately to months 
past spending levels will not be indicative of future spending as we are currently incurring increased expenses for selling  marketing and start up manufacturing costs in anticipation of the approval and subsequent launch of estrasorb 
in addition  we have recently entered into a long term lease agreement for a  square foot manufacturing facility for estrasorb 
the leased area is currently being built out to meet our requirements and is expected to be available in the second quarter of we have also placed orders for the equipment required to manufacture estrasorb at projected 
table of contents commercial levels 
the capital expenditures required for these activities will be between and million in  and we are currently seeking debt financing from public and private sources  to fund these capital requirements 
if the approval of estrasorb is delayed or denied we will be able to reduce some  but not all  of the expenses and capital expenditures related to this product introduction 
additional future expenditures for other product development  including those related to outside testing and human clinical trials  are discretionary and  accordingly  can be adjusted to available cash 
we currently plan to continue to progress in our clinical development activities and commercial scale up of product manufacturing of additional product candidates and we anticipate future increases in spending associated with these activities 
we may seek to establish additional collaborations with industry partners to defray the costs of clinical trials and other related activities 
we will also consider sources of additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies  government agency contracts or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding or bank financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms to permit successful commercialization of all our technologies and products 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  or seek alternative measures including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products
