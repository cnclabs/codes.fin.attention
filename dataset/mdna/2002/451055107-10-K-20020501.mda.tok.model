accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  the timing of the receipt of future revenues could be impacted by the recent trend among retailers in the company s industry to order goods closer to a particular selling season than they have historically done so

unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the united states economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  among other factors noted herein  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volumes of products sold during the second quarter
