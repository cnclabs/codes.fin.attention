these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the significant accounting policies which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition integrated media solutions our network revenues are derived principally from short term advertising agreements in which we deliver advertising impressions for a fixed fee to third party web sites comprising our network 
our email related revenues are derived principally from short term delivery based agreements in which we deliver advertisements to email lists for advertisers and web sites 
revenues are recognized as services are delivered provided that no significant obligations remain outstanding and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
service revenue is derived from driving traffic to a client website or the delivery of email messages for clients both of which are recognized upon delivery

technology solutions our technology revenues are derived from licensing of our ad serving software and related maintenance and support contracts 
in addition  we derived revenue from our broadband and professional services subsidiary  imake  which was sold in january   and our email service bureau subsidiary  exactis  and our third party ad serving subsidiary  sabela  both of which were sold in may of revenue from software licensing agreements is recognized in accordance with statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements upon delivery of the software  which is generally when customers begin utilizing the software  there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all elements of the arrangement 
revenue related to the central ad serving product is recognized based on monthly usage fees 
revenue from software maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreements  which typically do not exceed one year 
maintenance revenue invoiced in advance of the related services is recorded as deferred revenue 
expense from our licensing  maintenance and support revenues are primarily payroll costs incurred to deliver  modify and support the software 
these expenses are classified as cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
consulting revenues derived from our broadband professional services subsidiary  imake  are under fixed price contracts that are recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on labor hours incurred to total estimated contract hours 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recognized as the hours are incurred 
fixed monthly maintenance contracts are recognized in the corresponding months 
commencing january   the company will no longer generate revenue from these consulting contracts due to the sale of imake in january accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  to be held and used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are carried at their lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
during this review  we reevaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been an impairment of the value of long lived assets based upon events or circumstances  which have occurred since acquisition 
the impairment policy is consistently applied in evaluating impairment for each of our wholly owned subsidiaries and investments 
the impairment factors evaluated by us may change in subsequent periods  given that our business operates in a highly volatile business environment 
this could result in significant additional impairment charges in the future 
results of operations compared to factors affecting comparability of to on october   we acquired real media 
this accounted for million of revenue in the fourth quarter of  which was equally derived from the integrated media solutions and technology solutions segments 
the merger created cost synergies for our combined company  one of which was to focus on real media s proprietary open adstream technology and abandon our existing ad serving technology  connect 
the transition of the network business onto the open adstream platform began in december resulting in the elimination of redundant personnel and operating costs associated with the two ad serving platforms  open adstream and connect 
during the latter part of and throughout  in accordance with our business plan  we divested or discontinued many of our non core assets  including in december  the operations of awardtrack were abandoned and in may we were able to sell the intellectual property 
in may  we completed the sale of certain technology assets and intellectual property of sabela and completed the shut down of sabela operations on june  in may  we completed the sale of exactis  our email service bureau

revenue was only slightly impacted by our decision to exit the awardtrack product line and the latin american market  which accounted for approximately million or of our overall decrease 
the declines in revenue were partially offset by our merger with real media on october  which added million or and the inclusion of website results for a full year in as compared to only four months in  which added million

the cost of technology revenues consists of time and materials for consulting contracts  the cost of equipment and broadband for our third party adserving solutions and payroll costs to deliver  modify and support software

through august  we completed numerous acquisitions that were financed principally with shares of our common stock and were valued based on the price of the common stock at that time 
starting with the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated the carrying value of our businesses on a quarterly basis 
the revaluation was triggered by the continued decline in the internet advertising and marketing sectors throughout and in addition  each of these entities have experienced declines in operating and financial metrics over several quarters  primarily due to the continued weak overall demand of on line advertising and marketing services  in comparison to the metrics forecasted at the time of their respective acquisitions

where impairment was indicated  we determined the fair value of its business units based on a market approach  which included an analysis of market price multiples of companies engaged in similar businesses

the market price multiples are selected and applied to the business based on the relative performance  future prospects and risk profile of the business in comparison to the guideline companies 
the methodology used to test for and measure the amount of the impairment charge was based on the same methodology used during the initial acquisition valuations 
as a result  during our review of the value and periods of amortization of both goodwill and certain other intangibles it was determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets were not recoverable 
the other intangible assets that were determined to be impaired related to the decline in fair market value of acquired technology  a significant reduction in the acquired customer bases and turnover of workforce which was in place at the time of the acquisition of these companies 
as a result  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to several of our operating units were less than their recorded carrying values

in january  we sold our imake division

we have generated much of our liquidity through monetization of our investments primarily in chinadotcom common stock  which generated approximately million and million in proceeds throughout and  respectively  net cash received in our acquisitions of approximately million and million  respectively  and million in proceeds from the sale of our non core assets  which included exactis  sabela and awardtrack during during  these proceeds were used to finance restructurings and sustain operations during a period of declining revenues 
in  the proceeds were used to finance growth in operations  acquisitions of subsidiaries and investments discussed above  and the purchase of property and equipment needed during this growth period 
we used approximately million and million of cash in operating activities during and  respectively  generally as a result of our net operating losses  adjusted for certain non cash items such as amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  gains on sales of investments and non core assets and sale of patent  net of expenses  impairment of investments and intangibles and non cash related equity transactions and restructuring and exit costs  and also significant decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in versus million in the majority of the cash provided by investing activities during related to proceeds received from the sale of our non core assets  net of expenses  proceeds from the sale of our investments  primarily chinadotcom and cash acquired in our acquisitions  net which amounted to million  million and million respectively 
during  cash provided by investing activities related to proceeds received from our sale of a portion of our investment in chinadotcom and marketable securities  acquisitions and exchange of our patent rights  net of related expenses which amounted to million  million and million respectively 
in addition to our acquisitions and our investments discussed above  during we had continued to invest heavily in technology and efforts to develop our infrastructure through capital expenditures  including capitalized software 
during  as a result of divestitures of non core assets and numerous restructurings  we had significantly scaled back our capital expenditures 
cash used for such expenditures totaled approximately million and million for and  respectively 
to the extent we continue to acquire additional ad serving hardware  invest in enhancing or expanding our current product lines  make cash investments in other businesses or acquire other businesses  net cash used in investing activities could continue to be significant 
currently  we have various capital and operating leases relating to the use of computer hardware  software and office space 
the annual lease for our corporate headquarters is approximately million per year 
total rent expense for relating to all leases was million 
as of december   we had obligations amounting to million in connection with equipment purchased under capital leases 
these obligations are payable at various intervals between and we expect to meet our current capital lease obligations with our cash and cash equivalents 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  less than after total year years years years loan payable   operating leases      capital leases as a result of the merger with real media and the decision to consolidate onto the open adstream technology platform  we have excess equipment and did not budget for a significant amount of capital expenditures in the company has various employment agreements with employees  the majority of which are for one year with automatic renewal 
the obligation under these contracts is approximately million for including salary and performance based target bonuses 
these contracts call for severance in the event of involuntary termination which range in amount from two months to two years salary 
all european employees have employment contracts as required by local law 
the majority of these contracts allow for resignation or termination by either party at any time  according to the notice period provisions contained in the employment contracts  or according to the minimum notice period as mandated by local law 
the contracts  or if no expressed provision is included in the contract  local law  also require severance for involuntary terminations ranging from one to six months 
as of january   there were approximately employees in europe whose annualized base salaries were approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining of cash outlay obligations relating to restructuring and exit costs 
these amounts consist primarily of severance and rent exit costs which are being paid ratably 
we paid the majority of these costs in the first quarter of and expect all remaining amounts will be paid by the end of the second quarter of no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded because we incurred net operating losses for all periods presented 
at december   we had approximately million of us and million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and a net capital loss carryforward of at least million 
foreign net operating loss carryforwards have been reduced to reflect the disposition of the international operations of europe nv 
our net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years through  and the net capital loss carryforwards expire in as a result of various equity transactions during  and  we believe the company has undergone an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  the utilization of a substantial part of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited 
due to our history of operating losses and the section limitation  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding whether we will ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  these assets have been fully reserved 
during and  the valuation allowance increased by million and by million respectively 
of the total valuation allowance of million  tax benefits recognized in the future of approximately of million will be applied directly to additional paid in capital 
this amount relates to the tax effect of employee stock option deductions included in our net operating loss carryforward 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market demand of our services  the capital required to maintain our technology  and the resources we devote to marketing and selling our services 
we have received a report from our independent accountants containing an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations since inception and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes that the support of our vendors  customers  stockholders  and employees  among other  continue to be key factors affecting our future success 
moreover  management s plans to continue as a going concern rely heavily on achieving revenue targets  raising additional financing and controlling our operating expenses 
management believes that signficant progress has been made in reducing operating expenses since the real media merger 
in addition  management is currently exploring a number of strategic alternatives and is also continuing to identify and implement internal actions to improve our liquidity 
these alternatives may include selling assets which could result in changes in our business plan 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we may sell additional equity securities  which would result in further dilution of our stockholders 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due to both our current stock price and the significant amount of financing we may be required to raise 
these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt 
any indebtedness could contain covenants  which would restrict our operations 
with the acquisition of real media  inc in october  the company acquired a note payable of million to publigroupe  who as a result of the merger is a significant shareholder 
the note bears interest at and principal and interest are due on october  in addition  in accordance with the real media purchase agreement in january  the company received cash of million and signed a promissory note bearing interest at  with interest and principal due in january if the company achieves certain target operating results for the three months ended march  it will be entitled to receive another million in exchange for a three year promissory note 
on march   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with maya cove holdings 
the agreement gives us the ability to sell our common stock to maya pursuant to periodic draw downs once a registration statement covering these shares has been declared effective by the sec 
the draw downs would be subject to our ability to continue trading on the nasdaq  our trading volumes and prices and our ability to comply with securities registration requirements for this type of facility 
based on current market price  we estimate the maximum potential draw down is approximately million 
to date  no amounts have been drawn under this facility 
there can be no assurances that it will provide the resources necessary to fund our needs and we are continuing to evaluate other fund raising vehicles 
on january   we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  imake  to schaszberger corporation 
under the terms of the sale  the purchase price payable to schaszberger corporation payable to us was up to approximately million for the stock of imake consisting of million in the form of a four year secured note due in january  approximately million in cash consideration  and a potential earnout of up to million over the next three years based on gross revenue 
additionally  we received series a preferred stock of schaszberger corp which  as of the closing date  represented of the buyer 
the note is secured by certain assets of imake and is guaranteed by schaszberger corporation 
we have recorded the consideration received at its estimated fair value of million for the note receivable and million for the earnout as part of assets held for sale at december  in january  we received the cash consideration of million for the note receivable and have received the first monthly earnout payment as scheduled 
pursuant to the sale of exactis to experian  million was to be held in escrow until august this amount has been reflected as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we received a letter from experian alleging that we made certain misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the sale 
on march   we reached a settlement agreement with experian whereby we authorized the escrow agent to release  to experian and experian authorized the escrow agent to release the remaining balance of approximately  to us 
the funds have been received by us 
despite significant rationalizations in our cost structure  our current cash and other resources may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for we have limited operating capital and no current access to any meaningful funds 
our continued operations therefore may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through sale of equity or debt financing or another strategic transaction that raises capital 
we are in discussion with several potential sources of financing  however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to sell additional equity or issue debt securities in the future or that additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
market for company s common equity the shares of our common stock are currently listed on the nasdaq national market 
due to the recent decline in the share price of our common stock and our continued operating losses in april  we received a letter from nasdaq stating that they have determined that we have failed to meet nasdaq s minimum listing requirements and as a result  our common stock could be delisted if we do not satisfy these requirements by july  on august   the company announced that  in order to seek to increase the price per share of its common stock and regain compliance with nasdaq requirements  it intended to recommend to its stockholders approval of a reverse stock split of its common stock  which would result in stockholders being issued one new share for each ten to shares previously held 
in late september the company received notice from nasdaq that due to the market turmoil brought about by the terrorist attack in september  nasdaq was suspending its minimum share bid price and market capitalization requirements through at least december  nasdaq reinstated its bid price and market capitalization requirements as of january  on february   we received a letter from nasdaq stating that they have determined that we have failed to meet nasdaq s minimum listing requirements and as a result  our common stock could be delisted if we do not satisfy these requirements by may  we plan to appeal the nasdaq determination  although there can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful 
if the company s stock price remains below through may   the company will again have to consider steps to regain compliance with nasdaq requirements  which may include a reverse stock split or a transition to the nasdaq smallcap market  in which case we would have at least days additional time and up to days  additional time if our stockholders equity meets certain requirements to regain compliance with the bid price requirement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its nasdaq listing in the future 
our failure to meet nasdaq s maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
in such event  trading  if any  in the securities may then continue to be conducted in the non nasdaq over the counter market in what are commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board and the pink sheets 
as a result  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the securities 
in addition  we would be subject to a rule promulgated by the securities and exchange commission that  if we fail to meet criteria set forth in such rule  imposes various practice requirements on broker dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
for these types of transactions  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transactions prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may have a materially adverse effect on the ability of broker dealers to sell the securities  which may materially affect the ability of shareholders to sell the securities in the secondary market 
delisting could make trading our shares more difficult for investors  potentially leading to further declines in share price 
it would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital 
we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity if we are delisted 
impact of recently issued accounting standards goodwill and other intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and subsequently  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  after its adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption  and  if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit of all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
and finally  any unamortized negative goodwill and equity method negative goodwill existing at the date that statement is adopted must be written off as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which supersedes both fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
statement retains the fundamental provisions in statement for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement for example  statement provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
statement retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike statement  an impairment assessment under statement will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is excluded from the scope of statement no 
that is  a goodwill impairment write down will never occur as a result of applying statement however  it is possible for a long lived asset group under statement to include goodwill 
goodwill will be included in the carrying amount of a statement asset group if that group is  or includes  a reporting unit under statement this scenario is unlikely for large companies  however  it could be encountered for small companies 
when impairment is measured under statement  the carrying amount of the asset group is compared to the group s fair value 
any shortfall is recognized as a reduction to the carrying amounts of only the long lived assets in the group 
the carrying amount of goodwill is then evaluated for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  once statement no 
is adopted 
companies are required to adopt statement no 
no later than the year beginning after december  the company is required to adopt statement no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of statement will have on the company s financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk cash and cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by real media 
our accounts receivables are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
due to the current economic environment  we believe that we have sufficiently provided for any material losses in this area  however  there can be no assurance that unanticipated material losses may not result 
we transact business in various foreign countries 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses the united kingdom and in countries which the currency is the euro 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for  and was not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
our debt is at fixed rates  therefore  there is no rate risk 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those set forth under risk factors below 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
risk factors we will need to raise additional funds to continue operations and our recurring operating losses and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our current cash may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for and there can be no assurance that new funds can be secured when needed 
the support of our vendors  customers  stockholders and employees will continue to be key to our future success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional financing to meet our cash and operational needs or reduce our operating expenses or increase revenues significantly to address this going concern issue 
since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and we believe we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we also expect to incur negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as a result of our operating losses 
we have received a report from our independent accountants on our december  consolidated financial statements containing an explanatory going concern paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency since inception raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue our business as a going concern 
management s plans to continue as a going concern rely heavily on achieving revenue targets  reducing operating expenses and raising additional financing 
management is currently exploring a number of strategic alternatives and is also continuing to identify and implement internal actions to improve our liquidity 
these alternatives may include selling assets  which could result in changes in our business plan 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we may sell additional equity or debt securities 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due to our current stock price and the significant amount of financing we need to raise and these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt 
any indebtedness could contain covenants that restrict our operations 
we have limited access to the capital markets to raise capital 
the capital markets have been unpredictable in the past  especially for unprofitable companies such as ours 
in addition  it is difficult to raise capital in the current market conditions 
the amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control  such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume 
as a result  there is no guarantee that our efforts to secure financing will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
due to our operating losses  it may be difficult to obtain debt financing 
if we are able to consummate a financing arrangement  there is no guarantee that the amount raised will be sufficient to meet our future needs 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  our business  results of operation  financial condition and continued viability will be materially adversely effected 
the low price of our common stock could result in its delisting from the nasdaq national market 
the shares of our common stock are currently listed on the nasdaq national market 
due to the recent decline in the share price of our common stock and our continued operating losses in april  we received a letter from nasdaq stating that they have determined that we have failed to meet nasdaq s minimum bid price requirements and as a result  our common stock could be delisted if we do not satisfy these requirements by july  on august   the company announced that  in order to seek to increase the price per share of its common stock and regain compliance with nasdaq requirements  it intended to recommend to its stockholders approval of a reverse stock split of its common stock  which would result in stockholders being issued one new share for each ten to shares previously held 
in late september the company received notice from nasdaq that due to the market turmoil brought about by the terrorist attacks in september  nasdaq was suspending its minimum share bid price and market capitalization requirements through at least december  nasdaq reinstated its bid price and market capitalization requirements as of january  on february   we received a letter from nasdaq stating that they have determined that we have failed to meet nasdaq s minimum listing requirements and as a result  our common stock could be delisted if we do not satisfy these requirements by may  if the company s stock price remains below through may   the company will again have to consider steps to regain compliance with nasdaq requirements  which may include a reverse stock split or a transition to the nasdaq smallcap market  in which case we would have at least days additional time and up to days  additional time if our stockholders equity meets certain requirements to regain compliance with the bid price requirement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its nasdaq listing in the future 
our failure to meet nasdaq s maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
in such event  trading  if any  in the securities may then continue to be conducted in the non nasdaq over the counter market in what are commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board and the pink sheets 
as a result  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the securities 
in addition  we would be subject to a rule promulgated by the securities and exchange commission that  if we fail to meet criteria set forth in such rule  imposes various practice requirements on broker dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
for these types of transactions  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transactions prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may have a materially adverse effect on the ability of broker dealers to sell the securities  which may materially affect the ability of shareholders to sell the securities in the secondary market 
delisting could make trading our shares more difficult for investors  potentially leading to further declines in share price 
it would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital 
we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity if we are delisted 
high volatility of stock price 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to be volatile 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past 
we may also become involved in this type of litigation 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue growth in prior periods may not be indicative of future growth 
at times in the past  our revenues have grown significantly  primarily as a result of our numerous acquisitions 
our limited operating history makes prediction of future revenue growth difficult 
accurate predictions of future revenue growth are also difficult because of the rapid changes in our markets and the possible need by us to sell assets to fund operations 
accordingly  investors should not rely on past revenue growth rates as a prediction of future revenue growth 
we have a limited operating history on which an investor can evaluate our business 
we have an extremely limited operating history 
you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by companies with limited operating histories  particularly companies in new and rapidly expanding markets such as internet advertising 
these risks include our ability to develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our web sites  advertisers  and other third parties  further develop and upgrade our technology  respond to competitive developments  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  and attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
we anticipate continued losses and we may never be profitable 
we have not achieved profitability in any period and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the months ended december  and  respectively 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast 
our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the addition of new or loss of existing clients  changes in fees paid by advertisers and direct marketers or other clients  changes in service fees payable by us to owners of web sites or email lists  or ad serving fees payable by us to third parties  the demand by advertisers  web publishers and direct marketers for our advertising solutions  the introduction of new internet marketing services by us or our competitors  variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations  including personnel costs  changes in governmental regulation of the internet  and general economic conditions 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors 
in addition  our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues  as we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our financial performance and reduction of our workforce may affect the morale and performance of our personnel 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
in an effort to reduce our cash expenses  we began to implement certain restructuring initiatives and cost reductions 
in the past months  we reduced our workforce by over  employees 
we have also left positions unfilled when employees have left the company 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more stable companies they perceive to have better prospects 
our failure to retain qualified employees to fulfill our current and future needs could impair our future growth and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our financial performance may affect our ability to enter into new business relationships and to collect revenues 
the publicity we receive in connection with our financial performance and our measures to remedy this performance generate negative publicity  which may negatively affect our reputation and our business partners and other market participants perception of our company 
if we are unable to maintain the existing relationships and develop new ones  our revenues and collections could suffer materially 
our business may not grow if the internet advertising market does not continue to develop 
the internet as a marketing medium has not been in existence for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate its effectiveness 
our business would be adversely affected if the internet advertising continues to remain soft or fails to develop in the near future 
there are currently no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet marketing other than clickthrough rates  which generally have been declining 
we cannot be certain that such standards will develop to sufficiently support internet marketing as a significant advertising medium 
actual or perceived ineffectiveness of online marketing in general  or inaccurate measurements or database information in particular  could limit the long term growth of online advertising and cause our revenue levels to decline 
our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully implement our business model 
a significant part of our business model is to generate revenue by providing interactive marketing solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
the profit potential for this business model is unproven 
to be successful  both internet advertising and our solutions will need to achieve broad market acceptance by advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
our ability to generate significant revenue from advertisers will depend  in part  on our ability to contract with web publishers that have web sites with adequate available ad space inventory 
further  these web sites must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers 
the intense competition among internet advertising sellers has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for internet advertising 
these alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels of advertising revenue and applicable gross margin that can be sustained by us or the internet advertising industry in general 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of  and to generate demand for  our products and services 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct business apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of these clients 
acceptance of our new solutions will depend on the continued emergence of internet commerce  communication and advertising  and demand for its solutions 
we cannot assure you that demand for its new solutions will emerge or become sustainable 
banner advertising  from which we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue  may not be an effective advertising method in the future 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the delivery of banner advertisements 
online banner advertising has dramatically decreased since the middle of and has continued to decline throughout and is expected to continue through the second quarter of  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if advertisers determine that banner advertising is an ineffective or unattractive advertising medium  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively make the transition to any other form of internet advertising 
also  there are filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
the commercial viability of internet advertising  and our business  results of operations and financial condition  would be materially and adversely affected by web users widespread adoption of such software 
in addition  many online advertisers have been experiencing financial difficulties  which could materially impact our revenues and our ability to collect our receivables 
growth of our business depends on the development of online direct marketing 
adoption of online direct marketing  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional means of direct marketing  such as telemarketing and direct mail  is an important part of our business model 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services to generate demand for our direct marketing services 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit  or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct market apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of our clients 
loss of our major web sites would significantly reduce our revenues 
the network generates a significant portion of our revenues  and we expect that the network will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
the network consists of a limited number of our web sites that have contracted for our services under agreements cancelable generally upon a short notice period 
for the months ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from advertisements on our top ten web sites 
for the month period ended december   the top ten web sites included earthlink  inc  at t worldnet service  epipo  inc 
solutions  spedia 
com  inc  gk inc 
quotetracker  community connect  inc  womensforum 
com  inc  musiccity 
com  infogames inc 
games 
com and desktop dollars  inc we experience turnover from time to time among our web sites  and we cannot be certain that the web sites named above will remain associated with us or that such web sites will not experience a reduction in online traffic on their sites 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace any departed web site in a timely and effective manner with a web site with comparable traffic patterns and user demographics 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of the web sites that account for a significant portion of our revenue from the network 
loss of major customers would reduce our revenues 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
we expect that a limited number of these entities may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the months ended december   our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
customers typically purchase advertising or services under agreements on a short term basis 
since these contracts are short term  we will have to negotiate new contracts or renewals in the future that may have terms that are not as favorable to us as the terms of existing contracts 
we cannot be certain that current customers will continue to purchase advertising or services from us or that we will be able to attract additional customers successfully  or that customers will make timely payment of amounts due to us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue 
we have grown our business through acquisition 
we were formed in february to consolidate three internet advertising companies and have since acquired thirteen more companies 
in combining these entities  we have faced risks and continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls  ad serving technology  reporting systems and procedures  and expanding  training and managing our work force 
this process of integration may take a significant period of time and will require the dedication of management and other resources  which may distract management s attention from our other operations 
we may continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired business 
our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company could adversely affect our business 
our advertising customers and the companies with which we have strategic relationships may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
as a result of unfavorable conditions in the public equity markets  some of our customers may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support their long term operations 
as a result  these customers have reduced their spending on internet advertising  which has materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  from time to time  we have entered into strategic business relationships with other companies  the nature of which varies  but generally in the context of customer relationships 
these companies may experience similar adverse business conditions that may render them unable to meet our expectations for the strategic business relationship or to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
such an event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year and direct marketers mail substantially more marketing materials in the third quarter each year 
internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months  which reduces the number of advertisements to sell and deliver 
expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
our revenue could be materially reduced by a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers  direct marketers or the economy in general  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle 
due to such risks  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results 
our technology solutions may not be successful and may cause business disruption 
open adstream is our proprietary next generation ad serving technology that is intended to serve as our sole ad serving solution 
we launched open adstream central and network in mid  and we must  among other things  ensure that this technology will function efficiently at high volumes  interact properly with our database  offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions 
this development effort could fail technologically or could take more time than expected 
our open adstream technology resides on a computer system located in our data centers housed by exodus communications 
these systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them  including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements without significant delay to the viewer 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers and result in contract terminations  fee rebates and make goods  thereby reducing revenue 
slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events 
in addition  interruptions in our solutions could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require 
despite precautions that we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in the delivery of our solutions 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
the markets for internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors  changing demands regarding customer service and support  shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors  and the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of our services and products 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully compete against current or future competitors 
in addition  the internet must compete for a share of advertisers total budgets with traditional advertising media  such as television  radio  cable and print  as well as content aggregation companies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising 
to the extent that the internet is perceived to be a limited or ineffective advertising or direct marketing medium  advertisers and direct marketers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet marketing  which could limit the growth of internet marketing 
changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users and other individuals could harm our business 
the us federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in october  the european union adopted a directive that may limit our collection and use of information regarding internet users in europe 
the effectiveness of our open adstream technology could be limited by any regulation limiting the collection or use of information regarding internet users 
since many of the proposed laws or regulations are just being developed  we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on its business 
in addition  growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals has led to self regulation of these practices by the internet advertising and direct marketing industry and to increased federal and state regulation 
the network advertising initiative  or nai  of which real media is a member along with other internet advertising companies  has developed self regulatory principles for online preference marketing 
these principles were recently endorsed by the federal trade commission  and are in the process of being adopted by the nai companies 
the direct marketing association  or dma  the leading trade association of direct marketers  has adopted guidelines regarding the fair use of this information which it recommends participants  such as us  through our services  in the direct marketing industry follow 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection  distribution and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
although our compliance with the dma s guidelines and applicable federal and state laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on us  we cannot assure you that the dma will not adopt additional  more burdensome guidelines or that additional  more burdensome federal or state laws or regulations  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  will not be enacted or applied to us or our clients  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose our ceo or other senior managers our business will be adversely effected 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel  particularly david j 
moore  chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could materially adversely affect our ability to develop our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel in the internet industry is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we can attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  especially in sales and marketing positions 
our international operations may pose legal and cultural challenges 
we have operations in a number of international markets  including canada  europe and asia 
to date  we have limited experience in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
international operations are subject to other risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  general import export restrictions relating to encryption technology and or privacy  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world 
in addition to these factors  due to our minority stake in real media korea in asia  we are relying on our partner to conduct operations  build the network  aggregate web publishers and coordinate sales and marketing efforts 
the success of the network in asia is directly dependent on the success of our partner and its dedication of sufficient resources to our relationship 
dependence on proprietary rights and risk of infringement 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have received two patents in the united states  and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the united states 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will be of value in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the network 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
intellectual property liability 
we may be liable for content available or posted on the web sites of our publishers 
we may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising we serve if the music  artwork  text or other content involved violates the copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights of such third parties or if the content is defamatory 
any claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or divert management s attention 
privacy concerns may prevent us from collecting user data 
growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles 
web sites typically place small files of information commonly known as cookies on a user s hard drive  generally without the user s knowledge or consent 
cookie information is passed to the web site through the internet user s browser software 
our open adstream technology targets advertising to users through the use of identifying data  or cookies and other non personally identifying information 
open adstream enables the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to the user 
most currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive  and a small minority of users are currently choosing to do so 
users can also delete cookies from their hard drive at any time 
some internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our targeting capabilities 
recently  microsoft corporation changed the design and instrumentation of its web browser in such a way as to give users the option to accept or reject third party cookies 
giving users the option to decline such cookies could result in a reduction of the number of internet users we are capable of profiling anonymously 
such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns sold and delivered by us and the frequency with which users of sites in the network see the same advertisement 
if the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited  we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information 
while such technology currently exists  it is substantially less effective than cookies 
replacement of cookies could require significant reengineering time and resources  might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations  and might not be commercially feasible 
in addition  privacy concerns may cause some web users to be less likely to visit web sites that contribute data to our databases 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  we are developing our database to collect data derived from user activity on our networks and from other sources 
we collect and compile information in databases for the product offerings of all our businesses 
individuals or entities may claim in the future  that our collection of this information is illegal 
although we believe that we have the right to use and compile the information in these databases  we cannot assure you that our ability to do so will remain lawful  that any trade secret  copyright or other intellectual property protection will be available for our databases  or that statutory protection that is or becomes available for databases will enhance our rights 
in addition  others may claim rights to the information in our databases 
further  pursuant to our contracts with web publishers using our solutions  we are obligated to keep certain information regarding each web publisher confidential and  therefore  may be restricted from further using that information in our business 
we may have to change our business plans based upon changes in information collection practices 
there has been public debate about how fair information collection practices should be formulated for the online and offline collection  distribution and use of information about a consumer 
some of the discussion has focused on the fair information collection practices that should apply when information about an individual that is collected in the offline environment is associated with information that is collected over the internet about that individual 
we are working with industry groups  such as the nai and the online privacy alliance  to establish such standards with the us government regarding the merger of online and offline consumer information 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing industry standards acceptable to the us government or the various state governments  or that the standards so established will not require material changes to our business plans 
we also cannot assure you that our business plans  or any us industry standards that are established  will either be acceptable to any non us government or conform to foreign legal and business practices 
as a consequence of governmental legislation or regulation or enforcement efforts or evolving standards of fair information collection practices  we may be required to make changes to our products or services in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of the product or service or their attractiveness to potential customers 
in addition  given the heightened public discussion about consumer online privacy  we cannot assure you that our products and business practices will gain market acceptance  even if they do conform to industry standards 
changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the united states congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
state governments or governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information by us 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
dependence on the web infrastructure 
our success will depend  in large part  upon the maintenance of the web infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and timely development of enabling products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable web access and services and improved content 
we cannot assure you that the web infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the web continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may have to spend considerable amounts to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the web has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure 
such outages and delays could impact the clients using our solutions and the level of user traffic on web sites on our networks 
risks associated with technological change 
the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of our company 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  impede the ability of our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
