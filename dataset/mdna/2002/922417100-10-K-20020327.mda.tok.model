item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview veeco is a leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of a broad line of precision metrology and process equipment used to measure  test and manufacture microelectronic products for the data storage  telecommunications wireless semiconductor  research and industrial markets 
process equipment is primarily used to etch and deposit materials in the manufacture of tfmhs and optical active and passive devices that greatly expand the bandwidth capacity of existing fiber optic networks 
metrology equipment is primarily used to measure critical dimensions for research  optical and semiconductor devices  as well as tfmhs 
during the past several years  veeco has strengthened both the process equipment product line and the metrology product line with strategic acquisitions 
see item business the company acquisition history above 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relationship in percentages of selected items of veeco s consolidated statements of operations to its total net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense amortization expense other expense income  net merger and restructuring expenses write off of purchased in process technology asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes net income loss years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended december  sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us increased by approximately million  or  from the increase in us sales is primarily attributable to a million increase in process equipment sales  due to increased etch and deposition equipment sales to the data storage industry  as well as increased sales of optical filter deposition products to the telecommunications industry 
sales of mbe equipment produced by applied epi  which we acquired in september  have also contributed to the increase in us process equipment sales by approximately million over the comparable period 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and thus there were no reportable sales for applied epi in the comparable period 
european sales increased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this is primarily a result of a increase in process equipment and a increase in metrology sales over sales in japan increased by million  or  over the prior year  primarily as a result of increased metrology sales 
sales in asia pacific decreased by million  or  over the comparable period  as a result of decreased sales in optical metrology products  partially offset by an increase in afm sales 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   increased million  or  over the prior year  due partially to a million  or  increase in optical filter deposition sales to the telecommunications industry 
etch and deposition product sales  principally to the data storage market  also increased by million  or over the prior year 
mbe sales  as a result of the applied epi acquisition  were million during the year ended december  metrology sales of million for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from the comparable period  reflecting a increase in the sale of afms  offset by a decrease in sales of optical metrology products 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a decrease from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders decreased to million  primarily due to the significant business downturn in the telecommunications industry 
orders for optical filter deposition equipment decreased  or million  from the comparable period 
orders for etch and deposition equipment  sold primarily to the data storage industry  decreased by  or million  from the prior year 
metrology orders decreased to million  reflecting a decrease in orders for afms as well as a decrease in orders for optical metrology products 
the order declines are a result of the general economic slowdown that has had a very significant impact on the telecommunications  data storage and semiconductor markets that the company serves 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to for the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily for products related to the optical telecommunications market 
the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to the weak business environment  the company may continue to experience cancellation and or rescheduling of orders 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  related to the write off of inventory  which is included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to from in excluding the merger and restructuring charges in both years  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to from due primarily to a mix change resulting in an increase in process equipment sales with lower average gross margins  as well as a decline in optical metrology sales 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million  or  over the comparable period of  due primarily to additional research and development in certain ion tech and afm product areas  as well as the inclusion of the newly acquired businesses of applied epi and tm  which were not included in veeco s spending in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or of sales  for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared to million  or of sales  in the dollar increase is related to increased sales volume  primarily in the afm product line and and deposition equipment for optical filters 
amortization expense for the year ended december   of million  increased by million or over the comparable period of  due to the intangible assets acquired in connection with applied epi and tm acquisitions 
other expense  net for the year ended december  increased million or over the comparable period  due to the impact of foreign currency exchange losses  principally in the first quarter of during the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately million in response to the significant downturn in the telecommunications industry and the overall weak business environment 
this charge consisted of a million write off of inventory included in cost of sales related to order cancellations and the rationalization of certain product lines  million related to personnel costs and business relocation and million for the write down of long lived assets 
the million charge for personnel and business relocation costs was principally related to plant consolidations and a workforce reduction of approximately employees  which included both management and manufacturing employees located in all operations of the company 
as of december   approximately million for termination benefits has been paid and approximately million remains accrued 
the write down of long lived assets to estimated net realizable value related primarily to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the slc product line  which has been phased out  as well as the write down of certain machinery and equipment 
in connection with the applied epi acquisition  the company recorded a million write off of the fair values of acquired in process technology projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
on the date of acquisition  applied epi s in process technology value was comprised of programs related to research systems  production systems  performance products and mocvd systems that were approximately   and complete  respectively 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by using the income approach  which involves estimating the discounted after tax cash flows attributable to projects  based on the projects stage of completion 
the rate used to discount net cash flows to their present value was 
in connection with the tm acquisition  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process technology projects for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses and thus  the amounts were expensed as of the date of acquisition 
expenditures to complete both applied epi s and tm s projects are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurances can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
additionally  the projects will require maintenance r d after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects  and there is no assurance that these projects will meet with technological or commercial success 
the company signed a letter of intent to sell the remainder of the industrial measurement business 
this segment is currently comprised of the x ray fluorescence thickness measurement systems 
in january  the company sold its leak detection business  which was part of this segment 
accordingly  the company has classified the industrial measurement business as a discontinued operation 
closing date for the sale is expected to take place in the second quarter of sales for the industrial measurement business totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended  the company recorded a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million  which is net of income taxes of million and includes the write off of approximately million of goodwill that was previously allocated to this segment 
during  the company incurred a loss on disposal of its leak detection business of million  which is net of income taxes of million 
loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  which is net of income taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
the assets to be sold include accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and fixed assets and include certain liabilities to be assumed by the purchaser 
the net assets held for sale of approximately million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million or of income before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as compared with million or in the higher effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the million merger and restructuring charges incurred in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
critical accounting policies general veeco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon veeco s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires veeco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to derivatives  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs and contingent litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and derivatives to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition effective january  the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products produced according to the company s published specifications  where no installation is required or installation is deemed perfunctory and no substantive customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product has been tested and it has been demonstrated that it meets the customer s specifications and title passes to the customer 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention generally to  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment since installation does not involve significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment or building complex interfaces and connections 
in addition  the equipment could be installed by the customer or other vendors and generally the cost of installation approximates only to of the sales value of the related equipment 
for new applications of the company s products  for new products or for products with substantive customer acceptance provisions where performance cannot be fully assessed prior to meeting customer specifications at the customer site  revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of final customer acceptance 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in other accrued expenses  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
the company provides for warranty costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage for the next to month s requirements is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to veeco s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if it is determined that impairment indicators are present and that the assets will not be fully recoverable  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally expected to acquire the asset and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these assumptions  and thus veeco may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
during december   approximately million of intangible assets have been written off in connection with a phased out product line 
the company will fully adopt sfas no 
 effective january  the company will be required to perform impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first quarter of veeco has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
derivatives during the year ended december   the company used derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in order to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known foreign currency exposures  the company enters into monthly forward contracts which during the year ended december  included a majority of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s forward contracts do not subject it to material risks due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities  both the forward contracts and the underlying assets and liabilities are marked to market through earnings 
years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended december  sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  respectively  accounted for   and of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us increased by approximately million  or from the increase in us sales is principally associated with a million increase in process equipment sales of ion tech to the optical telecommunications industry 
european sales decreased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
sales in japan and asia pacific increased by million  or  and million  or  respectively  over the comparable period 
the increase in sales in japan principally reflects increased sales of afm products  while asia pacific s increase is primarily due to the february purchase of the slider crown adjust product line 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   increased by million or due to a million or increase in sales  principally to the optical telecommunications industry  partially offset by a decline in sales to data storage customers 
metrology sales of million for the year ended december  increased by million or from the comparable period  reflecting a increase in optical metrology products from the newly acquired metrology businesses of optimag  monarch and the slider crown adjust product lines  as well as a increase in the sale of afms 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a increase from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders increased to million primarily due to strong orders for ion tech s spector related equipment  principally to the optical telecommunications industry  which reflected increased orders of or million over the comparable period 
metrology orders increased to million reflecting a increase in orders for afms as well as an increase in orders for optical metrology products from the newly acquired metrology businesses of optimag  monarch and the slider crown adjust product lines 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to in connection with the merger with cvc  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million during  of which a million non cash charge  or of net sales  related to the write off of inventory  which has been included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to from in excluding merger and restructuring charges  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to  due primarily to a decline in data storage process equipment gross margins from levels due to the volume decline  as well as price and cost pressures 
metrology gross margin decreased to in compared to in  due primarily to new product transition in optical metrology  primarily at the company s minneapolis site  which produced the slider crown adjust product line 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million or over the comparable period of  due primarily to the continued investment in new products and technology for both the process equipment and metrology businesses as well as investment with respect to acquired businesses which did not have comparable spending in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million or over the comparable period of the increase is attributable to the expansion of direct sales and service presence in both japan and the asia pacific regions  as well as the purchase of commonwealth  optimag and the slider crown adjust product lines  which had lower comparable operating spending in since these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
amortization expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million or over the comparable period of  due to the addition of intangible assets of businesses purchased in and  including optimag  slider crown adjust product line and the atomic force microscope product line 
as previously noted  during  veeco incurred merger and restructuring charges of million in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
of these charges  a million non cash charge related to a write off of inventory included in cost of sales  million represented merger and reorganization costs of which million related to investment banking  legal and other one time transaction costs and million pertained to duplicate facility and personnel costs and million was for the write down of long lived assets 
the company implemented a reorganization plan in an effort to integrate cvc into the company  consolidate duplicate manufacturing facilities and reduce other operating costs 
the million charge for duplicate facility and personnel costs principally related to the closing of the cvc virginia facilities and an approximate person work force reduction  which included both management and manufacturing employees 
during the year  the entire accrual of million for merger and reorganization costs was expended 
the write down of long lived assets to estimated net realizable value related primarily to leasehold improvements  machinery and equipment and intangible assets for cvc s virginia facilities 
in addition  the million non cash write off of inventory principally related to cvc s virginia facilities product line of ion beam etch and deposition equipment 
the company has integrated the technology from this product line into veeco s existing ion beam etch and deposition products 
accordingly  the company has determined that a portion of this product line s inventory is not useable in the future 
during  the company recorded charges of million related to the merger with ion tech 
in conjunction with the optimag acquisition  the company recorded a million write off of the fair values of acquired in process technology projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
on the date of acquisition  optimag s in process technology value was comprised of the oasis version hardware and software component development program that was completed in in conjunction with cvc s acquisition of commonwealth scientific corporation  cvc recorded a million charge for the write off of acquired in process technology costs  including products in the development stage that had not reached technical feasibility and for which there is no alternative future use 
due to the merger of veeco and cvc  the company implemented a reorganization plan  which included the closing of cvc s virginia facilities 
due to this restructuring  the in process technology program has been abandoned by the company 
during  approximately million was spent on this program 
during and  the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million and million  respectively  which is net of income taxes 
during  the company incurred a loss on disposal of its leak detection business of million  net of income taxes 
the leak detection business was part of the industrial measurement business and thus has been classified as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million or of income before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  as compared with million or in the higher effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the million merger and reorganization charges incurred in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the cumulative effect of this change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of million  which is included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations of million  the liquidation of short term investments of million  the borrowing of million under the company s credit facility and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issuances under the company s employee stock purchase plan were sufficient to fund the acquisitions of applied epi and tm as well as capital expenditures 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of  compared with at the end of and at the end of the company s primary source of funds at december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
this amount represents an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
in december  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes  and in january  the company issued an additional million of notes pursuant to an over allotment option 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company will pay interest on these notes on june and december of each year  commencing on june  the notes will mature on december  in connection with this offering  the company purchased approximately million of us government securities  which have been pledged to the trustee under the indenture  as security for the exclusive benefit of the holders of the notes 
these securities will be sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments due on the notes and thus represent restricted investments 
except with respect to these pledged securities  the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all other indebtedness of the company 
the notes are repayable upon certain change of control events and upon the acceleration of certain other indebtedness for money borrowed of the company 
after the third anniversary of issuance  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture relating to the notes 
in october  the company will repay a mortgage upon maturity  which had a balance of approximately million at december  on april   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility the facility  which replaced the company s prior million revolving credit facility 
the facility s interest rate is a floating rate based on the prime rate of the lending banks and is adjustable to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flows exceeds a defined ratio 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the facility has a term of four years and borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other things  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  long term leases  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company is also required to satisfy certain financial tests 
in connection with a recent amendment of this facility  certain financial covenants and definitions were amended and the accounts receivable of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries were pledged to secure the company s obligations under this facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility  but approximately million of letters of credit were outstanding under the facility 
at december   veeco s contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to its debt obligations and lease payments are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      operating leases      letters of credit   cash provided by operations totaled million during the year ended december  this amount consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  net loss on the disposal of discontinued operations  non cash restructuring and other expenses  write off of purchased in process technology and a stock option income tax benefit aggregating million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable decreased due to the decrease in sales volume during the fourth quarter of these items were partially offset by an increase in inventories  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  deferred gross profit and other current liabilities and an increase in deferred taxes of million  million  million and million  respectively 
accounts payable decreased primarily as a result of reduced ordering of materials and services due to a lower level of business activity at the end of as compared to the reduction in deferred gross profit is the result of a lower level of sales and product mix that impacts timing of revenue recognition 
net cash used in investing activities in totaled million 
during the year ended  the company s cash outflows consisted of acquisitions of approximately million  the purchase of long term investments of million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by the liquidation of available for sale securities of million 
the company expects investments in property  plant and equipment to be approximately million in the company intends to finance these investments from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million 
the generation of cash in primarily resulted from the million subordinated convertible debt offering in december the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements including the payments described in the preceding paragraphs through risk factors that may impact future results in addition to the other information set forth herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company 
we depend on the microelectronics industry 
the cyclicality of the data storage  telecommunications wireless semiconductor  research and industrial industries directly affects our business 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  telecommunications wireless and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as research and industrial customers  which accounted for the following percentages of our net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage telecommunications wireless semiconductor research and industrial the data storage  telecommunications wireless  semiconductor  research and industrial industries are cyclical 
these industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
a downturn in one or more of these industries or the businesses of one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
the current global downturn in general economic conditions and in the markets for our customers products is resulting in a reduction in demand for some of our products  and during this downturn and any subsequent downturns we cannot assure you that our sales or margins will not decline 
as a capital equipment provider  our revenues depend in part on the spending patterns of our customers  who often delay expenditures or cancel orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions 
because a high proportion of our costs are fixed  our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue short falls is limited 
in a prolonged economic downturn  we may not be able to reduce our significant fixed costs  such as continued investment in research and development or capital equipment requirements 
in addition  during an economic downturn we may experience delays in collecting receivables  which may impose constraints on our working capital 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect our quarterly results include cyclical patterns of capital spending by customers  changes in the market for personal computers  network servers  telecommunication wireless devices or other products incorporating telecommunications wireless  data storage or semiconductor research technology  market acceptance of our systems and our customers products  specific economic conditions in the telecommunications wireless  data storage or semiconductor research industries  our acquisitions and financings  changes in product mix  the timing of significant orders and customer acceptance of our products  the introduction of new products and technological innovations by us and our competitors  production and quality problems and resulting shipment delays  changes in the cost of materials  and disruption in our sources of supply 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if our new orders  net sales or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  our stock price may be adversely affected 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change and we may be unable to maintain timely product introduction 
the data storage  telecommunications wireless  semiconductor manufacturing  research and industrial industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon our ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced systems at competitive prices and to accurately predict technology transitions 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins  which could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including our product offerings  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  service and marketing  and product performance in the field 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially and adversely affected if orders are cancelled or rescheduled or if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipping during the period 
customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period 
we depend on a limited number of customers that operate in highly concentrated industries 
we rely on our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales 
based on sales  seagate technology  inc and international business machines corporation  or ibm  are our top two customers 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net sales to seagate and ibm our only customers with sales greater than in any of the past three years for the following periods year ended december  seagate ibm if any principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks  our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
in addition  because a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are our customers  dominate the industries in which they operate  it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
a substantial portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our net sales  and therefore our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows  to fluctuate widely from period to period 
these variations often are based upon factors partially or completely outside our control 
the factors that affect the length of time it takes us to complete a sale depend upon many elements  including the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives  the history of previous sales to a customer  the complexity of the customer s fabrication processes  the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  and the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers 
as a result of these and a number of other factors that influence our sales cycles with particular customers  the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer  if ever  varies widely 
our sales cycle typically can range up to twelve months 
sometimes our sales cycle can be much longer  particularly when the sales cycle involves developing new applications for our systems and technology 
during these cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts before receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite these sales efforts 
in addition to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable sales cycles  the build cycle  or the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications  typically ranges from one to six months 
during this period  the customer may cancel its order  although generally it will be required to pay us a fee based on which stage of the build cycle we have completed 
for many of our products  after a customer purchases one of our systems we provide an acceptance period during which the customer may evaluate the performance of the system and potentially reject the system 
in addition  customers often evaluate the performance of one of our systems for a lengthy period before purchasing any additional systems 
the number of additional products a customer may purchase from us  if any  often depends on many factors that are difficult for us to predict accurately  including a customer s capacity requirements and changing market conditions for its products 
as a result of these evaluation periods and other factors  the period between a customer s initial purchase and subsequent purchases  if any  often varies widely  and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industries 
the industries in which we operate are intensely competitive 
established companies  both domestic and foreign  compete with each of our product lines 
many of our competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a particular customer selects a competitor s capital equipment  we expect to experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control  including price  product quality  breadth of product line  system performance  cost of ownership  global technical service and support  and success in developing or otherwise introducing new products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and legal and regulatory changes 
in  approximately of our total net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  and in  approximately of our total net sales were generated from sales outside the united states 
we expect sales from non us markets to continue to represent a significant  and possibly increasing portion of our total sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in some instances  have a material effect on our results of operations 
in particular  a weakening of the euro or the yen could result in a weakening of our overall financial results 
although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  these hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
as a result of this exchange rate exposure  as well as the other factors listed above  we may experience a material adverse effect upon our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
our operating results are influenced by the performance of asian economies  which have experienced significant downturns during the past few years 
in recent years  asian economies including japan have been highly volatile and recessionary  resulting in significant fluctuations in local currencies and other instabilities 
approximately of our sales in and approximately of our sales in were derived from this region 
instabilities in asian economies including japan may continue and recur again in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
our exposure to the business risks presented by asian economies including japan will increase to the extent we continue to expand our operations in that region 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies included in some of our products 
in addition  some of our customers may use our microelectronics products for applications that are similar to those covered by these patents 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
as of the date of this filing  none of these allegations has resulted in litigation 
competitors or others may  however  assert infringement claims against us or our customers in the future with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
we are exposed to the risks that third parties may violate our proprietary rights and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success depends on the protection of our proprietary rights 
in our industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of other countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect  or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
we derived approximately of our sales from foreign countries in  and approximately of our sales from foreign countries in if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of managerial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel 
in particular  we depend on our chairman  president and chief executive officer  edward h 
braun 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
we may not be able to retain our key managerial  engineering and technical employees 
our growth is dependent on our ability to attract new highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  in addition to personnel that can implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
attracting qualified personnel is difficult  and we cannot assure you that our recruiting efforts to attract and retain these personnel will be successful 
our recent acquisitions  as well as additional acquisitions in the future  subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our business 
we have made significant acquisitions during the past five years 
in addition  we may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of our then existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our then existing shareholders could be diluted  which could affect the trading price of our common stock and of the subordinated notes 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes  including making payments on the notes 
also  acquisition financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
future acquisitions may also require us to assume contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
we may not obtain sufficient affordable funds to fund our future needs for manufacturing capacity and research and development 
we need to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our operations and to enhance our manufacturing capability to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
also  our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase in the future 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as a percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
during the past few years  the markets for equity and debt securities have fluctuated significantly  especially with respect to technology related companies  and during some periods offerings of those securities have been extremely difficult to complete 
as a result  in the future we may not be able to obtain the additional funds required to fund our operations and invest sufficiently in research and development on reasonable terms  or at all 
such a lack of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
we are subject to costs and other risks associated with non compliance with environmental regulations 
we are subject to environmental regulations related to the disposal of hazardous wastes used in the development and manufacturing of our products 
the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of production  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet their needs 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
our articles of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan and delaware law may have anti takeover effects which will make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
we have designated  of those shares as series a junior preferred stock for potential issuance under our shareholder rights plan described below 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of the preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock and  as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors with staggered terms 
the existence of a classified board may render certain hostile takeovers more difficult and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of veeco in certain instances  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
further  if shareholders are dissatisfied with the policies and or decisions of our board of directors  the existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for the shareholders to change the composition and therefore the policies of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  under which we have granted to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock 
these rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer for our common stock that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on a takeover attempt that a shareholder of veeco might consider to be in its best interest 
furthermore  we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain other measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of veeco 
certain of such measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
these measures may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
in addition  certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to  without limitation  a actions required to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent  b the percentage of shareholders required to call a special meeting of shareholders  c a limitation on the maximum number of directors  d removal of directors only for cause  and e the percentage of shareholders required to approve amendments to our bylaws  may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the general corporation law of delaware  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes mergers  asset sales as well as certain transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or within three years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
the operation of section may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are rates on debt and short term and long term investment portfolios  and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents and obligations of us government agencies 
these investments in obligations of the us government are considered held to maturity securities 
accordingly  the amounts are carried at amortized cost 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
veeco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects that net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in in march  the company began using derivative financial instruments 
veeco does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts was approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   there were no open forward contracts 
the aggregate foreign exchange losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the foreign currency exchange loss is net of approximately million of realized hedging gains 
the change in currency exchange rate that has the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating profit is the japanese yen 
the company estimates that based upon the december  balance sheet  a change in foreign exchange rates is immaterial to operating profit 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
