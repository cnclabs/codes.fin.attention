item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general as of december   we operated o charley s restaurants in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee and virginia and two stoney river restaurants in atlanta and one in chicago 
o charley s are casual dining restaurants that are intended to appeal to mainstream casual dining customers as well as upscale casual dining and value oriented customers by offering high quality  freshly prepared food at moderate prices with friendly and attentive customer service 
our growth strategy for the o charley s concept is to continue penetrating existing and new targeted major metropolitan areas while opening new units in smaller secondary markets in close proximity to our metropolitan markets 
stoney river restaurants are upscale steakhouses that are intended to appeal to both upscale casual dining and fine dining customers by offering hand cut  premium midwestern beef along with fresh seafood and other gourmet entrees with attentive service in a warm  friendly and relaxed environment 
our growth strategy for stoney river is to concentrate on major metropolitan markets in the southeast and midwest with disciplined  controlled development and the potential to accelerate development over the next several years 
we operate a commissary for the primary purpose of providing our restaurants with consistent quality food products that meet our specifications while obtaining lower prices for those items through volume purchasing 
a substantial majority of the food products served in our restaurants are distributed to the restaurants by the commissary 
in addition to purchasing food and other non food products  the commissary manufactures certain proprietary products and ages and cuts red meat into steaks in its usda approved and inspected facility 
we believe our commissary gives us a competitive advantage in servicing our restaurants and a financial advantage 
we attribute the decreases in food cost as a percentage of our restaurant sales over the past three years  in part  to the financial leverage generated from the increased purchasing volumes and operating efficiencies of our commissary 
on may   we purchased two existing stoney river restaurants and all associated trademarks and intellectual property for approximately million in a cash transaction accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  the results of operations of the two stoney river restaurants have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition 
total revenues for the stoney river concept were million and million in and  respectively 
our interest expense increased as a result of the indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition 
our depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the million of goodwill associated with the acquisition 
the pretax loss for the stoney river concept was million and million in and  respectively 
the following tables reflects changes in the number of restaurants we operated during the years presented o charley s restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened restaurant closed in operation  end of year stoney river restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants acquired restaurant opened in operation  end of year during the third quarter of  we incurred a charge of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  related to the closing of five stores 
these current closings are the result of a comprehensive review of the past and expected performance of all locations  taking into consideration the difficult economic environment 
we closed one of the five restaurants closed in we closed two additional stores in the first quarter of we have completed a feasibility study on franchising our o charley s restaurant concept and are in the process of finalizing the proper legal and regulatory requirements in order to begin franchising 
we have begun marketing the franchise concept  but we do not believe we will generate any revenue or profits in we project approximately  in expenditures for this franchising project in  and we may continue to experience expenditures and losses until such time  if ever  that we generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenditures 
revenues consist of restaurant sales and to a lesser extent commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s branded food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
cost of food  beverage and supplies primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
we believe our menu offers a broad selection of menu items and as a result there is not a high concentration of our food costs in any one product category 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather  cause periodic fluctuations in food and other costs 
generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to customers  however  we have in the past generally adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for restaurant level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates restaurant management for achieving and exceeding certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
we typically pay our employees more than minimum wage and do not expect an immediate adverse effect on our financial performance from any further increase in the federal minimum wage rate 
however  as in prior years  we do expect that overall wage inflation will be higher for several years following any minimum wage increase 
as congress has raised the federal minimum wage rate in recent years  the base wage rate for our tipped employees has remained at 
any increase to the base wage rate for our tipped employees would increase payroll costs 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
we are evaluating a possible sale leaseback facility pursuant to which the lessor would acquire certain of our restaurant properties and then lease those properties to us 
to the extent that proceeds from any sale leaseback transaction are used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  this would reduce our interest expense 
we would incur additional rent expense  however  which would increase our restaurant operating costs 
the accounting standards setting bodies are currently considering changes to the accounting rules that could impact how we would account for such a transaction 
advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life 
depreciation and amortization also includes amortization of goodwill  which relates primarily to the acquisition of the stoney river concept 
our depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the million of goodwill incurred in connection with our may acquisition of the stoney river legendary steaks concept 
in accordance with a new accounting pronouncement  sfas no 
 statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangibles beginning in  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized 
we are currently evaluating the fair value of these assets that have a carrying value of approximately million at december  we would be required to record a charge in if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value at december  any such impairment loss would be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

preopening costs include operating costs and expenses incurred prior to a new restaurant opening 
our current practice of expensing preopening costs may cause fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on when those costs are incurred 
see risk factors fluctuations in our operating results and other factors may result in decreases in our stock price 
we recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy in the first quarter of starting in  we began reflecting our preopening costs on a separate line item labeled preopening costs on the statement of earnings rather than reporting these costs in the depreciation and amortization line item 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one year includes costs incurred during the year for restaurants opened and under development 
we incurred average preopening costs of approximately  for each new o charley s restaurant opened during we anticipate higher preopening costs for each stoney river restaurant we open as compared to the average preopening costs for an o charley s restaurant 
the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report and on form k 
the following table reflects our operating results for   and as a percentage of total revenues unless otherwise indicated 
fiscal years and were comprised of weeks while fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
as a result  some of the variations reflected in the following data may be attributed to the different lengths of the fiscal years

while restaurant operating margin is a non gaap measurement  we believe it is a relevant and useful metric in discussing our operating results 
as a percentage of commissary sales 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new o charley s restaurants  the inclusion of the two original stoney river restaurants for the entire year following their acquisition in may  one new stoney river restaurant opened in  and an increase in same store sales at our o charley s restaurants of  including a customer traffic increase of 
our overall check average for the o charley s concept was in and in the increases in revenue were partially offset by us having weeks of operations in as compared to weeks in in january  we increased menu prices at our o charley s restaurants by approximately 
we believe we realized the majority of that price increase during the first quarter of  but by the end of the first quarter  we began to see slowing consumer spending which resulted in a lower than expected check average 
in response to the slowing consumer spending patterns  we increased our marketing efforts and began to promote lower priced entrees and lowered certain daily entree specials 
as a result of this effort  we believe we maintained our increases in customer traffic but lowered our overall check average 
near the end of the third quarter of  we began to see increases in consumer spending which raised our check average but we continued to promote lower priced entrees through the end of cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies decreased to in from in although we experienced a slight improvement in the cost of food  beverage  and supplies in  the reduction was not as significant as in the previous two years 
we continued to experience improved purchasing and operating efficiencies in our restaurants and commissary  which was partially offset by significantly higher costs for certain commodity food items  including red meat  cheese  and baby back ribs 
additionally  food costs were impacted by our stoney river restaurants in where the food costs are higher than o charley s due primarily to a higher percentage of red meat sales 
food costs were also impacted by the promotion of lower priced entrees in we anticipate more moderate increases in commodity costs in payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in the increase was attributable to increasing salaries for restaurant management along with higher employee benefit costs  including workers compensation and health insurance costs in our markets generally have low unemployment rates and we compete with other restaurants for employees 
we anticipate continued increases in wage rates and employee benefit costs in restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in in  we experienced higher utility costs  primarily natural gas  and higher insurance expenses  primarily general and liquor liability insurance 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in supervisory expenses in as a percentage of total revenue 
overall utilities in increased million  or  as compared to natural gas prices were significantly higher during the first three quarters of  but decreased during the fourth quarter to similar levels in the same quarter of we expect to continue to see higher insurance expenses in and are currently evaluating this area for our upcoming annual renewal 
advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  advertising  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in stoney river restaurants rely primarily on word of mouth to attract new customers rather than advertising 
o charley s advertising  as a percentage of o charley s restaurant sales  was in compared to in we increased our advertising expenditures beginning in the second quarter of through the end of the year in response to the slowing consumer spending trends we began to experience near the end of the first quarter 
an increase in television costs represented the primary share of the overall increase in advertising expenditures 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  but as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in from in the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a decrease in bonus and legal expenses 
depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to the growth in the number of new restaurants and capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants 
asset impairment and exit costs were million during during the third quarter of  we made the decision to close five restaurants 
the decision followed a review of historical and projected cash flows of our stores in view of the difficult economic environment in which we were operating 
as a result of this decision  we recognized a charge during the third quarter of for asset impairment of approximately million and exit costs of approximately  primarily associated with certain related lease commitments 
preopening costs in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  preopening costs increased to in from in this increase is attributable primarily to the cost incurred for the new o charley s restaurants in addition to higher preopening costs incurred for the new stoney river restaurant 
income from operations decreased million  or  to million in from million in excluding the asset impairment and exit costs  income from operations increased million  or  to million  in this increase is less than our original expectations due primarily to slowing consumer spending  higher than expected costs of certain food commodities  higher utilities  higher insurance costs and increased advertising expenditures 
interest expense  net decreased  in to million from million in this decrease is primarily the result of overall lower interest rates in the weighted average interest rate on our revolving credit facility decreased to in as compared with in due to lower short term libor rates in additionally  overall interest expense was reduced due to decreased borrowings on our revolver as we used the million proceeds from the sale of our common stock in april to reduce our debt 
see liquidity and capital resources 
earnings before income taxes for decreased million  or  to million from million in excluding the effect of the asset impairment and exit costs  earnings before income taxes increased to million in income taxes for decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in earnings before income taxes 
the effective tax rate decreased to of pre tax earnings from in due primarily to higher tax credits 
we currently expect our effective tax rate to be unchanged in the number of diluted weighted shares outstanding was million shares in  compared with million shares in the primary reason for this increase is the million shares of our common stock sold in april fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new o charley s restaurants  an increase in same store sales of  the additional week of sales as was comprised of weeks compared to weeks in  and the inclusion of stoney river restaurant sales following their acquisition in may in march  we increased menu prices by approximately 
cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies decreased to in from in we attribute these lower food cost percentages primarily to three factors a menu price increase in march  which increased the average check  a decrease in the cost of several food items  and improved purchasing and operating efficiencies in our restaurants and commissary 
these improvements were partially offset by the inclusion of the stoney river restaurants which we acquired in may and which have a higher cost of food  beverage and supplies as a percentage of sales  and an increase in poultry  red meat and baby back rib costs 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in the increase was attributable to increasing wage rates and salaries for restaurant support staff and management along with higher workers compensation and health insurance costs in those higher wages and salaries were partially offset by economies achieved from higher average restaurant sales volumes and reduced turnover rates for our hourly employees 
restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to economies achieved from higher average restaurant sales volumes 
utility costs began to significantly increase in december advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  advertising  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in o charley s advertising  as a percentage of o charley s restaurant sales  was in compared to in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from the inclusion of the stoney river restaurants acquired in may and increased salary  bonus and legal expenses 
depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to the growth in the number of new restaurants  capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants and the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition in may of the stoney river legendary steaks concept 
preopening costs  excluding the one time cumulative adjustment made in for the change in accounting principle as measured under sop  increased in to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  preopening costs decreased to in from in income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in interest expense  net increased million in to million from million in the increase was primarily related to the increased borrowings due to the addition of new restaurants and the acquisition of the stoney river legendary steaks concept

after adjusting for the tax benefit  the net cumulative effect was million 
quarterly financial and restaurant operating data the following is a summary of certain unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the last three fiscal years 
for accounting purposes  the first quarter consists of weeks and the second  third and fourth quarters each consist of weeks weeks in the fourth quarter of because it was a week year 
as a result  some of the variations reflected in the following table may be attributed to the different lengths of the fiscal quarters 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data revenues     income from operations     net earnings    basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues     income from operations     net earnings     basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues     income from operations     earnings before cumulative change in accounting     principle net earnings     basic earnings per common share earnings before change in accounting principle net earnings diluted earnings per common share earnings before change in accounting principle net earnings restaurants in operation  end of quarter fiscal years and consisted of weeks and fiscal consisted of weeks

as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of to reflect the differences between the fair value and net book value of the assets  and a charge of  for exit costs associated with the closure of such locations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  capitalized lease obligations  and sales of our common stock 
our principal cash needs arise primarily from the purchase and development of new restaurants  equipment replacement  improvements to existing restaurants  and the repayment of debt 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions  and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and internally generated funds  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   our working capital deficiency was million 
the total net increase in cash was million in cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in and million in other primary sources of cash in were million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  million of proceeds received upon the exercise of employee stock options and issuances under our stock purchase plan  and approximately million from the sale of assets 
additionally  we financed million in new restaurant equipment through capitalized lease obligations 
property and equipment expenditures were million in  including million of equipment acquired under capital leases 
these expenditures were made primarily for new o charley s restaurants opened during the year  the purchase of our home office and commissary facility  one new stoney river restaurant opened during the year  restaurants under construction at december   and improvements to existing restaurants and our commissary facilities 
other primary uses of cash in included the reduction of our credit facility using the million from the sale of our common stock  million in principal payments on capitalized lease obligations and other long term debt  and million for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility that has a maximum borrowing capacity of million that matures in october the amount outstanding under this facility was million on december   a decrease of million from december  the change in the amount outstanding in resulted from a reduction in the outstanding balance with the million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock  partially offset by net borrowings under the facility of approximately million 
the maximum borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by amounts financed under our synthetic lease facility described below 
the credit facility requires monthly interest payments at a floating rate based on the bank s prime rate plus or minus a certain percentage spread or the libor rate plus a certain percentage spread 
the interest rate spread basis points at december  is based on certain financial ratios and is recomputed quarterly 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the facility during was  as compared with during on december   the average interest rate on the outstanding balance of the facility was  as compared with at the end of our credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the maintenance of certain financial ratios  the incurrence of indebtedness  sale of assets  mergers and the payment of dividends 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions for the purpose of fixing the amount of interest we pay over a certain period of time at varying notional amounts 
at december   there were million in aggregate amounts of interest rate swap agreements outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 
the effective amount of interest we pay on the notional amounts of these swap agreements is calculated using the interest rate of the swap plus the percentage spread on our revolving credit facility 
the swap agreements outstanding at december  expire as follows million in january  and million in january we have available a synthetic lease facility pursuant to which the lessor has agreed to acquire or construct up to million of properties and lease the properties to us 
the terms of the facility provide for a separate operating lease agreement to be entered into for each property upon acquisition or completion of construction  each with a lease term ending october  monthly rental payments for each property lease are based on the total costs advanced by the lessor to acquire or construct such property  and the amount of those payments varies based upon the floating interest rate in effect from time to time under our revolving credit facility 
the acquisition and construction costs paid by the lessor under the synthetic lease facility reduce the maximum borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to purchase million of these properties from the lessor 
we are not currently leasing any assets under this facility and have no current plans to utilize it in the future 
we may do so in the future  however  subject to  among other factors  clarification of the impact of new accounting rules that appear to be forthcoming from the accounting standards setting bodies for such off balance sheet financing arrangements 
on september   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares  or of our outstanding stock  had been repurchased 
we repurchased approximately  shares in for a total expenditure of approximately million 
on may   we purchased two existing stoney river legendary steaks restaurants and all associated trademarks and intellectual property for approximately million in cash 
the transaction includes an earn out provision pursuant to which we may be required to pay the former owners up to million at the end of  million at the end of  and million at the end of the potential earn out is based on the stoney river legendary steaks concept achieving certain performance thresholds income before taxes and preopening costs for such year 
based on our projected results for the stoney river concept  we currently do not believe any earn out amounts will be owed for we have budgeted approximately million to million in for capital expenditures for the planned to new o charley s restaurants  improvements to existing o charley s restaurants  two new stoney river restaurants  purchase of three o charley s restaurants previously leased  expansion of our commissary facilities  and information systems improvements 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures in will not vary significantly from budgeted amounts based upon a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of restaurant sites 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures with operating cash flows  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capitalized lease obligations 
we intend to continue financing the furniture  fixtures and equipment for our new restaurants primarily with capitalized lease obligations 
we are currently evaluating a possible to million sale leaseback facility pursuant to which we would sell some of the restaurant properties at which we currently own the land and building and then lease those properties from the buyer 
we currently anticipate that proceeds from the sale would be used primarily to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  which would increase the amount available for future borrowings 
the effect of a sale leaseback transaction on our results of operations would be to replace interest expense and depreciation expense of the cost of the applicable properties with rent expense 
any gain on the sale of any properties would be amortized over the life of the lease 
subsequent to a sale leaseback transaction  our earnings could be negatively impacted due to rent expense being higher than the interest and depreciation expense 
we cannot assure you that we will enter into a sale and leaseback facility or  if we do so  the number of restaurant properties that we may sell or the terms of the leases pursuant to which we lease properties from the buyer 
we believe that available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and capitalized lease obligations will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital outlays for at least the next months 
we have historically produced sufficient cash flow from operations to supplement our capital needs each year 
our ability to meet our capital needs are highly dependent on us continuing to generate sufficient cash from operations and there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from a public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligation total yr yrs yrs thereafter in thousands long term debt   capitalized lease obligations      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial total committed yr yrs yrs thereafter commitments in thousands lines of credit   capitalized lease obligations include the interest expense component 
this pertains to our revolving line of credit of which million is included in long term debt shown above 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows property and equipment excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill impairment of long lived assets property and equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line method over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a store operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the assets use are realized 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   we currently amortize goodwill over years 
beginning in fiscal  we will be required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the goodwill to be tested is primarily related to the acquisition in may of the stoney river legendary steaks concept 
inherent in the policies regarding goodwill are the significant management judgments regarding the ongoing cash flow potential of the stoney river legendary steak concept and our ability to locate and develop profitable locations in the future 
since the may acquisition  we have opened two new stoney river stores and plan to open one additional store in these stores  not unlike any new store  may take time to reach a desired profitability point as the costs associated with labor and food cost in the first few months of operation are much higher as training  scheduling  and food preparation processes must be adjusted to meet customer demand 
while we fully expect this concept to ultimately operate at a positive cash flow after its opening  the newness of the concept to our management team and our ability to effectively gauge customer demand can materially affect the ultimate cash flow picture for the concept and thereby affect the amount of goodwill deemed to be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
at this time  because we have not finished our analysis pursuant to implementing sfas no 
 we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate effect that this new statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development and sustenance of a given market within which a store operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the store efficiently and effectively can cause the company to realize an impairment charge 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  which is the level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in earnings on a timely basis 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria which intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
immediately  except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to july  we were required to adopt sfas no 
on december  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of earnings 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million  which is subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
and amortization expense related to goodwill was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and  we have not completed our analysis of the impact of adopting these statements on our consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effect that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was later amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires recognition of the fair value of all derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging activities 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
 as amended  on january  and the adoption did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
related party transactions during  we leased the land and building of three of our restaurants from two mile partners  a partnership whose partners were the late david k 
wachtel  jr  who owned and was the managing partner of the partnership and a former director and executive officer of o charley s  and gregory l 
burns  who owns of the partnership and is our chairman and chief executive officer 
during  we terminated a lease with this entity for one of our previously operated restaurants 
subsequently  two mile partners  in an action initiated by mr 
wachtel in his capacity as managing partner  sued us alleging that we breached a continuous operation provision in the lease by vacating the property and opening another o charley s restaurant in clarksville  tennessee 
we paid approximately  in and  in in rent expense to two mile partners 
in january  we entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement with two mile partners settling all litigation and business matters between us 
as a result of the settlement  i we purchased restaurant properties located in goodlettsville  murfreesboro and clarksville  tennessee that we leased from two mile partners for million  million and million  respectively  ii we terminated our lease with two mile partners for a restaurant property located in bowling green  kentucky on which we formerly operated our bowling green restaurant and sold two mile partners an adjoining parcel of property used for parking for a payment of  and iii two mile partners dismissed with prejudice the litigation pending against us in consideration of a payment by us of  mr 
burns recused himself from our discussions and considerations of any matters relating to the settlement 
we believe that we terminated the clarksville lease in accordance with its terms and deny the allegations contained in the complaint filed by two mile partners 
nevertheless  a special committee of the board of directors comprised of disinterested directors approved the settlement and believed it was in our best interest in order to settle the litigation to avoid the expense  uncertainty and distraction of this litigation 
we believe the terms of the purchase of the goodlettsville  murfreesboro and clarksville properties and the sale of the bowling green property were fair to  and on terms no less favorable than  we would have obtained in an arms length transaction with an unrelated third party 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements related party transactions  and commitments and contingencies  and legal proceedings 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we currently utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized leases and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
in addition  to the extent we utilize our synthetic lease facility in the future  lease payments would be at variable rates based upon prevailing interest rates 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our revolving credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had in effect million in swaps at an average fixed rate of  million of which matures in january and million of which matures in january
