item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally engaged in the design  development  licensing and manufacture through collaborative arrangements with manufacturers of safety medical devices intended to reduce the incidence of accidental needlesticks 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from up front license payments made by bd 
on december   we entered into a license agreement with bd under which we licensed certain of our products to bd 
in connection with the agreement  we received an up front licensing fee of million in addition to the right to receive royalty payments based on bd s net sales of the licensed products 
in addition  the license agreement granted bd an option to license five of our other products 
on march   we signed a binding term letter with bd outlining the terms for a definitive agreement under which bd would license the products subject to the option to license 
we recognized million of revenue in the form of an up front licensing fee upon the signing of the binding term letter 
on may   we entered into a definitive license agreement with bd based upon the terms of the march  binding term letter 
under the definitive license agreement  we received an additional million in up front licensing fees and the right to receive royalty payments based on bd s net sales of the products licensed under such agreement 
on september   we entered into a development and licensing agreement with medamicus  inc granting medamicus a license to manufacture and market our safety seldinger introducer needle for certain venous applications 
under the terms of the agreement  we have the right to receive royalty payments based on medamicus net sales of the safety seldinger introducer needle 
on september   we entered into an addendum the addendum to the development and licensing agreement with medamicus 
the addendum grants medamicus an exclusive license to manufacture and market our safety seldinger introducer needle in the arterial access market and other related fields 
under the terms of the addendum  we received an initial payment of   of which was paid in  shares of medamicus common stock and  of which was paid in cash on october  in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties of of net sales of the product  which royalty rate may be reduced to if certain sales volumes are met 
on may   we entered into a five year co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
under the terms of the agreement  abbott oneone global pharmaceutical services will promote our safety pre filled cartridge injector in conjunction with abbott s filling and finishing of pharmaceuticals and biologics into vials  cartridges  syringes and intravenous bags for sale to other pharmaceutical companies 
in september  we entered into two oem manufacturing agreements with owens illinois closure inc for the manufacture of our safety pre filled cartridge injector and safety dental pre filled cartridge injector 
under the terms of the agreements  we will purchase the automated equipment and molds necessary for owens illinois to manufacture the products 
in january  we entered into a binding term sheet with sultan chemists that will  upon execution of a definitive agreement  give sultan the right to exclusively purchase  market and sell the safety dental pre filled injector for ten years 
bd introduced the safety iv catheter using med design s technology in april as the autoguard pro 
medamicus launched the venous access seldinger needle device in september we anticipate market introductions by bd of several licensed products encompassing our safety technology during results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to revenue of  in the revenue in consisted principally of an up front license payment from medamicus for the safety seldinger introducer needle arterial access 
the revenue in consisted principally of  in up front licensing payments made by bd under the may  license agreement 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to loss from operations of  for the corresponding period in the increase in operating loss was due primarily to a reduction in revenue that was partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses related to equity based compensation 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in the general level of business activities  primarily related to increased legal and travel expenses  to enable us to market our products 
stock based compensation  which resulted from the issuance and extension of options  warrants and other stock based grants and awards was  in and  in  a reduction of  there were no new agreements for stock based compensation in that resulted in expense in the period 
all expense recorded in related to the vesting of arrangements entered into in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the higher level of expenses in were due primarily to research and development activities to modify our licensed products based on specific requests of our licensees 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december  was  we had no revenue for the revenue in consisted principally of  in up front licensing payments made by bd under the may  license agreement 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  as compared to loss from operations of  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due primarily to the receipt of license fee revenue in offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation expenses described below 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation  for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in the general level of business activities  primarily related to increased legal and travel expenses  to enable us to market our products 
stock based compensation for the year ended december   was  an increase of  as compared to  for the same period in the increase was due to the extension of options and warrants for retiring officers and employees  and the issuance of shares of common stock  options and warrants to officers in accordance with their employment agreements 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available securities of  as compared to  for the corresponding period in  a decrease of  or 
despite losses from operations of  we benefited from the receipt of  as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in addition  our net loss reflected significant non cash expense  principally consisting of  in stock based compensation offset by non cash revenue of  at december   we had a revolving line of credit totaling  this facility can be used to fund working capital needs and finance capital equipment purchases 
however  advances for capital equipment financing may not exceed  and borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
any borrowings to meet working capital needs bear interest at libor plus  while borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases bear interest at the prime rate plus 
the facility expires on may   and there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating a continuation of the availability of the line of credit or the terms that will be made available to us 
there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at december  on march   we completed a private equity placement of  shares of our common stock for  our net proceeds after giving effect to placement agent fees totaled approximately  we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
the availability of resources over a longer term will be dependent on our ability to enter into licensing agreements and to receive royalty payments from our current and future licensees and our ability to enter into  and profitably operate under collaborative arrangements and our ability to raise additional equity or debt finance 
we have not yet generated sufficient cash flows from operations to support our operations on an on going basis and anticipate that we may need to seek additional sources of funding in the future 
historically  our cash flow has been provided by securities offerings and up front license fees 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating additional agreements  or if licensing revenues are insufficient to support our operations  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 
pursuant to our oem manufacturing agreements with owens illinois  we are required to purchase the automated equipment and molds necessary for owens illinois to manufacture our products 
these expenditures may be significant 
however  we will not incur any such expenses until we have entered into distribution agreements for such products 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report beginning on page f these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition involving up front license fees and royalties based on production or sales volume and stock based compensation 
our revenue recognition policy with regard to up front license fees calls for recognition upon the signing of a binding agreement when we have no further obligation under the agreement other than to defend the patent rights associated with such agreement 
our revenue recognition policy with regard to royalties based on production or sales volume calls for recognition in the period in which the relevant products are produced or sold 
the recognition of such revenues is dependent on our licensees and strategic allies accurately and timely reporting sales and production volume 
inaccurate or late reporting could result in recognition of revenue and related costs at an earlier or a later time 
certain of our licensees and strategic allies are contractually required to pay minimum royalties if sales or production volumes do not reach specified levels 
our revenue recognition policy with respect to these minimum royalties calls for recognition in the period to which the minimum royalties relate 
we periodically grant compensation to employees and non employee consultants in the form of equity 
these grants typically consist of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
we apply the guidance of apb accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for stock options  warrants and common stock issued to employees 
we record compensation expense over the service period of the employee if the exercise price of the option or warrant is less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
we account for options and warrants issued to our non employee consultants and directors who perform consulting services in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we record compensation expense over the contractual performance period and re measure that expense at the end of each fiscal quarter 
we measure the value of these instruments using the black scholes valuations model which requires management to make estimates 
variations in these estimates could have a material effect on the reported expenses recorded in the financial statements in any given period  and therefore  a material effect on our reported financial results 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes apb opinion no 
entitled business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
these provisions are effective for business combinations for which the date of acquisition is subsequent to june  sfas no 
addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition and eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and long lived assets with indefinite lives 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment test to be performed to evaluate the carrying value of such assets 
the provisions for sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these pronouncements will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit at december  if we were to borrow under our credit facility  borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus and borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  any such borrowings would be subject to the fluctuations in the market  which affect libor or the prime rate  respectively
