item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled distribution  information systems  competition  government regulation  and business risks included in this form k for the year ended february  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates related to reserves for store closures  inventory shrinkage  and insurance liabilities and other reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those which are underperforming 
we establish reserves for future rental payments on closed stores and terminated subleases  and classify these costs in general and administrative expenses 
the costs for future rental payments associated with closed stores are calculated using the net present value method  at a risk free interest rate  over the remaining life 
table of contents of the lease  net of expected sublease income 
judgment is used to estimate the underlying real estate market related to the expected sublease income  and we can make no assurances that additional charges to the current stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
as of february  and january   approximately million and million  respectively  was recorded for closed store reserves 
inventory shrinkage reserves our stores perform physical inventories once a year  and in between the physical inventories  the stores perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
our forward distribution centers and distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items every quarter 
therefore  as of a reporting period  there will be stores that will have certain inventory items that have not been counted 
due to the holiday season at the end of the fiscal year  the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the fiscal year  but continue to perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
therefore  as of each reporting period  we estimate the inventory shrinkage reserve for uninventoried sales based on a year historical trend analysis by store 
as of february  and january   approximately million and million  respectively  was recorded for inventory shrinkage reserves 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all of our stores  product liability insurance covering the sale of live pets  and worker compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies  we retain the initial risk of loss of  for each policy per occurrence 
we establish reserves for losses based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not yet been reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
as of february  and january   approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves was recorded related to casualty and workers compensation insurance policies 
these reserves were recorded in other accrued expenses 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of the company s management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we reversed valuation allowances on deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with the increase in ownership of petsmart

table of contents any future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on the opening of additional stores and the improved performance of existing stores 
in fiscal  we expect to open approximately new stores and remodel approximately stores under the new store format 
in view of the increasing maturity of our store base an average age of approximately years as of february   as well as the planned opening of additional stores in existing markets  which may diminish sales of existing stores  we anticipate that comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of our expansion plans  we anticipate the timing of new store openings  related preopening expenses  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
in addition  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising  and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  the impact of new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
we charge preopening costs associated with each new location to expense as the costs are incurred 
certain transactions in fiscal the following transactions which occurred during fiscal resulted in net charges  before taxes  of million  of which approximately million was recorded in cost of goods sold and approximately million was recorded in general and administrative expenses

the costs for future rental payments associated with closed stores were calculated using the net present value method  at a risk free interest rate  over the remaining life of the lease  net of expected sublease income

please see the section above entitled business risks for a discussion of some of the risks which may affect our business 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to some seasonal fluctuations and we typically realize increased sales volume and a substantial portion of our operating profits during the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  sales of certain of our products and services designed to address pet health needs have been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted by the introduction of alternative treatments  as well as by variations in weather conditions 
also  because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions 
our results of operations and financial position are presented based upon historical cost 
although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe inflation is likely to have a material adverse effect on our net sales or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an 
table of contents entity recognize all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge  depending on the nature of the underlying exposure  changes in fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  under sfas no 
 goodwill amortization ceases when the new standard is adopted 
the new rule also requires impairment tests on an annual or interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas no 
also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
 and will adopt the standard beginning fiscal once adopted  goodwill amortization of approximately  on an annualized basis will cease 
we have not yet determined the financial statement impact that may result from the adoption of this statement 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the new rules apply to the classification and impairment analyses conducted on long lived assets other than certain intangible assets  resolve existing conflicting treatment on the impairment of long lived assets and provide implementation guidance regarding impairment calculations 
sfas no 
also expands the definition of discontinued operations to include all distinguishable components of an entity that will be eliminated from ongoing operations in a disposal transaction 
we will adopt the standard beginning fiscal  and do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations

in february and march   we retired the remaining balance of million of notes for approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
transactions with the canadian subsidiary are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  management believes that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to a relatively limited number of transactions and operations denominated in foreign currency 
approximately  or of our revenues are denominated in the canadian dollar 
transaction gains and losses on united states dollar denominated transactions are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  and were not material
