part i item business introduction altigen communications  inc nasdaq atgn is the pioneer and market leader in internet protocol ip telephony systems for small and medium sized businesses smbs 
we design  manufacture and market next generation  time tested ip phone systems and contact centers that use both the internet and the public telephone network to take advantage of the convergence of voice and data communications 
our products play an important role in the small to medium sized phone system market by delivering solutions that leverage the open systems concept 
unlike traditional proprietary phone systems  altigen systems are designed from the ground up to be an open solution built on an industry standard platform 
the company s principal executive offices are located at fremont blvd  fremont  california the telephone number at that address is we were incorporated in may and reincorporated by merger in delaware in june industry background altigen communications is focused on the rapidly growing small to medium sized business market  which represents approximately million businesses in the u 
s altigen operates in the americas and the asia pacific region 
in a report dated july  allied business intelligence forecasted that premise and hosted ip private branch exchange pbx equipment revenues will exceed billion by in addition this report states that small and medium businesses have been a proving ground for the deployment of live telephony systems  and that some form of ip based systems will represent over of enterprise pbx seats shipped by the economic downturn in the us economy that began in has continued in fiscal  especially in the telecommunications industry 
sales of traditional legacy phone equipment provided by other vendors have steadily decreased while ip telecom solutions  like those which altigen sells  have increased 
in fiscal  we 
table of contents have experienced four quarters of sequential revenue growth  and we believe that altigen is well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity when the overall economy improves 
according to the yankee group in its report dated june  shipments of ip pbx are expected to surpass traditional pbx by convergence of voice and data traditionally  businesses have supported two separate  incompatible networks to handle their communications needs 
the first has been the traditional telephone network  which relies on a technology called circuit switching 
a circuit switched network establishes and maintains a dedicated ie not shared line between calling parties for the duration of a call 
the second type of network on which businesses have traditionally relied is a data or packet switched network  such as the internet 
in packet switched networks  voice  video  images or data is divided into small packets of signals that are simultaneously routed over different paths to a final destination where they are recombined 
packet switched networks are more efficient than the traditional telephone network because network paths are not dedicated to a single user  but instead are available to be shared by all users 
thus  network capacity is allocated only during transmission  and messages can be compressed and stored more efficiently 
the internet is accelerating the convergence of voice and data to a single integrated packet based network that can support both voice and data using internet protocol 
a growing number of businesses have recognized data networks such as the internet as a valuable and economical medium for internal and public communications 
these businesses seek to reduce their telecommunications costs by moving their voice communications to packet switched networks  such as corporate intranets and the internet 
although packet switched networks can offer more efficiency and value to businesses  the traditional telephone network remains the standard for voice communications today 
as a result  businesses that wish to take advantage of packet switched networks for voice communications must nevertheless be able to place and receive calls over the traditional telephone network with customers  suppliers and others who rely solely on the traditional telephone network for voice communications 
consequently  there is a need for one common switching system that can interface with both packet switched networks and the traditional telephone network 
evolution begins in small to medium sized businesses small to medium sized businesses of up to employees are likely to be the first to use converged voice and data networks because  unlike large organizations  they may not be heavily invested in legacy systems that are retained because the costs of replacing them outweigh their shortcomings  and can more quickly take advantage of new technological trends 
most of these businesses today use a traditional private telephone network as the backbone of their connection to the voice network  and maintain a separate data network 
today s traditional private telephone network remains an expensive  proprietary solution 
these systems require skilled personnel to physically prepare the installation site and to install the equipment  which can be difficult to install  upgrade and maintain 
thus administering this system may become prohibitively expensive for small to medium sized businesses with limited resources 
most existing telecommunications systems do not address the needs of businesses that wish to transmit voice communications over both the traditional telephone network and data networks 
for example  businesses may wish to route internal calls over their existing voice network and route calls between offices over data networks  such as the internet  all using the same telecommunications system 
we believe a significant opportunity exists to provide small to medium sized businesses with an integrated solution that delivers the benefits of integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems using ip networks as well as the traditional telephone network 
the altigen solution our ip telephony systems allow customers to implement business telecom solutions for smbs that lower their costs  improve their productivity today and provide a technology platform for the future 
with our products  
table of contents companies can migrate at their own pace with the same integrated system allowing smbs to compete effectively with large enterprises of all sizes

altiserv office supports standards based h 
ip phones and analog phones from multiple vendors 
key benefits of our solutions include reduced administration costs 
our user interface allows end users to administer their system internally 
with traditional private telephone systems  businesses frequently require a third party service provider to perform tasks as simple as changing a phone extension or adding a phone line 
these expenses can be significant for installation  system upgrades and modifications 
using altiserv  system administrators can perform many of these tasks without assistance from third parties 
lower toll costs 
by routing voice over data networks  including the internet  our systems eliminate toll charges associated with long distance calls 
using our products  businesses can send and receive voice communications over the internet or existing data lines that constitute their intranets

triton t pri board this microprocessor controlled board allows calls to be carried over digital interoffice lines 
quantum board this microprocessor controlled board allows calls to be carried over traditional analog telephone extension lines 
server chassis this chassis is the box used to house our software and hardware to provide a phone system or contact center 
raid hardware in case of power failure  this hardware is used to provide backup memory storage 
altigen hardware and firmware in  we developed a single base circuit board with powerful digital signal processing technology 
digital signal processing is a computer built on to the circuit board  which can run special  high speed software programs  called firmware 
firmware can receive  send and modify digital information for communications with network services 
our newest board  the triton dsp board  can be used to create different circuit boards to meet many communication requirements by simply adding a few hardware and or software components to the basic board 
for example  the triton dsp series circuit board becomes a t or isdn communication circuit board or a circuit board supporting the same communication format as the internet with simple changes in on board software and  in some cases  new circuits 
this modular design not only allows us to provide new capabilities  but also allows our products to achieve a high degree of reliability and cost reduction since the underlying technology is the same 
altigen modular software our software products are based on modular software components similar to the concept described above for our hardware and firmware 
the service provider layer of software is composed of separate software components  each of which communicates with a hardware circuit board within the altiserv system 
the middleware layer interacts with all the service providers in the system and manages their resources 
this layer 
table of contents hides the complexity of the hardware from application programs to provide specific features 
the application program layer consists of components that implement the application logic such as voicemail and auto attendant 
these applications do not depend on any particular hardware integration  the layered architecture of altiserv provides important benefits new feature development generally occurs more frequently  development times are more predictable  thus saving money  new hardware and software features can be added easily and rapidly  and changing one component in the system does not mean that other components have to be changed 
marketing  sales and customer support marketing our marketing efforts currently focus on increasing demand for our products in the americas and the asia pacific region 
we are working to increase market awareness of our technology and demand for our products in the small to mid sized business market through public relations  print  email and web campaigns 
among our marketing highlights are the following tmc labs innovation award for introduction of altiware open edition with multisite management capabilities  enabling a distributed intelligence network architecture introduction of alti ip phone for total plug and play ip telephony for the smb market 
to assist our distributors  dealers and strategic partners  we provide market development funds  marketing tools and technical and sales training developed specifically for our products 
in return  these companies must provide us with point of sale reports that allow us to develop a profile of end users of our systems and evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts 
sales we currently have sales and support staff in new york  illinois  ohio  colorado  florida  washington dc  texas  china and in our headquarters in fremont  california 
our network of distributors and over resellers sell our systems to end users 
our inside sales force answers incoming calls from end users and refers new leads to a qualified dealer near each end user s location 
the inside sales force is also responsible for account management of our smaller resellers 
our outside sales force in the americas includes regional sales managers and technology solutions managers  who work on our larger reseller deals and recruit new large reseller partners 
in fiscal  we continued our expansion to a more scalable reseller community by signing on an increasing number of resellers that currently sell traditional phone systems from companies including avaya  comdial and nec 
customers our direct customers are primarily distributors and resellers who sell and resell our products to end users 
we have distribution agreements with altisys  ingram micro  and synnex in the americas  emotion  neteltech and others in asia 
sales through altisys  ingram micro  and synnex accounted for approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal  and approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal we also have over authorized resellers who sell our products directly to end users 
we review our resellers quarterly and discontinue distribution through those who do not meet our revenue and technical standards 

table of contents customer support we believe that consistent  high quality service and support are key factors in attracting and retaining customers 
our customer support groups  located in california  new york  texas and shanghai  coordinates service and technical support of our products and provides service twenty four hours a day  seven days a week 
these personnel assist our distributors and resellers in resolving installation and support issues that arise from their sales to end users and also provides limited support to end users to supplement their dealer support 
resellers and end user customers can also access technical information and receive technical support through our web site 
research and development the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
we believe that our future success depends in large part upon our ability to continue to enhance the functionality and uses of our core technology 
we intend to extend the functionality and uses of our hardware and software technology by continuing to invest in research and development 
we currently conduct the majority of our product development in house 
we also use a small number of independent contractors to assist with certain product development and testing activities 
we intend to continue working with our strategic partners to enhance our products 
as of september   we employed individuals in engineering  research and development and support 
during fiscal   and  our research and development expense was approximately   and  respectively 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to changing technologies 
we currently compete with companies providing traditional telephone systems  principally avaya communications  nec and nortel networks 
we also compete against companies providing ip and ip enabled telecommunications systems  including  shoreline communications  inc  com corporation  cisco systems  inc  as well as any number of future competitors 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater name recognition  financial  sales and marketing  technical  customer support  manufacturing and other resources 
these competitors may also have more established distribution channels and stronger relationships with local  long distance and internet service providers 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
these competitors may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less expensive  that may provide higher performance or additional features or that may be introduced earlier than our solutions 
in fiscal  we continued to be price competitive with low cost of ownership 
we believe that our principal competitive advantages include system designed for small and medium business budgets  demonstrated and referenceable ability to cut communications costs  ease of manageability  simple deployment  time tested reliability since  ease of use  focused service and technical support since we only sell ip telephony  
table of contents over resellers and growing channels  and a considerable lead in product development 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
if we fail to compete successfully against current or future competitors  our business could suffer 
seasonality typically  the ip pbx industry experiences some seasonal variations in demand  with weaker sales in the winter months because of holidays and customers planned shutdowns 
this seasonality is particularly evident in the north american market 
intellectual property we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products 
altigen is a registered trademark  and zoomerang is a trademark pending registration by altigen in the united states and other jurisdictions 
in addition  the altigen logo is a trademark of altigen in the united states and other jurisdictions 
we have filed several us patent applications relating to various aspects of our client and server software  mixed media communications and computer telephony 
we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our technology and products 
we cannot be sure that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any issued patents will provide commercially significant protection to our technology 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product and service development efforts 
we have not  however  conducted and do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  it is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
if we were to discover that our products violate third party proprietary rights  we might not be able to obtain licenses to continue offering these products without substantial reengineering 
efforts to undertake this reengineering might not be successful  licenses might be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and litigation might not be avoided or settled without substantial expense and damage awards 
manufacturing and assembly our manufacturing operations consist of purchasing  receiving  inspecting  testing  packaging and shipping 
we depend on four suppliers who provided us with about of our hardware product components during fiscal we put these components into kits and send them to a sub contractor or external manufacturing facility for assembly 
the final hardware assembly  software installation and testing of our products is performed in house at our  square foot manufacturing floor  located at our corporate headquarters in fremont  california 
our manufacturing and assembly processes enable us to configure our products to adapt to different customer specifications at the final assembly stage 
this flexibility is designed to reduce both our assembly cycle time and our need to maintain a large inventory of finished goods 
we test our products both during and after the assembly process using internally developed product assurance testing procedures  which include visual inspection  functional testing and final systems testing 
although we generally use standard components for our products and try to maintain alternative sources of supply  we purchase some key components from sole source suppliers for which alternative sources are not currently available 
we incorporate the following sole sourced components in our products a zarlink corporation chip is included in all of our boards and is particularly important because it is the means by which our boards communicate with each other to enable our products to function correctly 

table of contents texas instruments digital signal processor dsp chip is included in our triton family of boards 
the dsp chip is designed to perform the mathematics  data compression and other tasks that are needed to manipulate voice communications that are routed through our products 
we expect that sales of these boards will represent an increasing percentage of our revenues in the future 
xilinx  inc s chip for our triton product line board allows our board to work with digital communications lines 
we expect that sales of our triton product line board will represent an increasing percentage of our revenues in the future 
legerity  inc s chips for our triton analog product line allows our board to work with analog communications lines 
we expect that sales of our triton product line board will represent an increasing percentage of our revenues in the future 
advantech provides the chassis for our altiserv office and alticenter office products based on our customer specifications 
loss of any key component supplier would adversely impact our business 
employees as of september   we had full time employees  including in research and development and support  in marketing and sales  in operations  and in finance and administration 
of these full time employees  were located in the united states and in china 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing  engineering and management personnel  who are in great demand 
item properties our headquarters for corporate administration  research and development and sales and marketing occupies approximately  square feet of space in fremont  california 
we also lease approximately  square feet of facility in mckinney  texas to serve as our technical support and training 
outside the united states  we lease approximately square feet of facility in shanghai  china where we conduct administration  research and development  sales and marketing 
in fiscal  we leased another  square feet of facility in beijing  china to serve as our sales and marketing 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our needs through at least the end of year we believe that any additional space we may need in the future will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings we may become parties to litigation in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex litigation are difficult to predict 
on september   vertical networks  inc filed suit against altigen communications  inc in united states district court for the northern district of california  case no 
c wha  alleging infringement of vertical networks united states patents nos 
    and  on october   vertical networks amended its complaint to add allegations of infringement of patents nos 
 and  vertical networks filed a second amended complaint on november  to identify the altigen products and or activities that allegedly infringe the seven patents in suit 
vertical networks seeks a judgment of patent infringement  damages  including treble damages for alleged willful infringement  and attorneys fees and costs 
altigen filed an answer and counterclaims for declaratory relief on december  altigen believes it has strong defenses and arguments in this dispute and intends to vigorously litigate its position

overview we provide converged ip phone systems for small and medium sized business 
we were incorporated in may and began operations in july we first recognized revenues from product sales of our quantum board and altiware software in july we generated net revenues of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we derive our revenues from sales of our altiserv system 
product revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to end users are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we 
table of contents also provide for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right in certain circumstances to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we provide distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each quarterly and annual period since our inception and we currently expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
as of september   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various periods from to if they are not utilized 
under current tax law  net operating loss carryforwards available in any given year may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events  including changes of ownership interest 
we have not recognized any future tax benefits of our cumulative net operating losses due to uncertainty as to future realizability 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to end users  including dealers  and to distributors 
revenues from sales to end users are recognized upon shipment  when risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits  and the price is fixed and determinable 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return and protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by its distributors 
upon termination  any unsold products may be returned by the distributor for a full refund 
these agreements may be canceled by either party based on a specified notice 
as a result of the above provisions  we defer recognition of revenues and the proportionate costs of revenues derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the amounts deferred as a result of this policy are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  we could be required to increase our allowance and our earnings could be adversely affected 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review value of inventory in detail  with consideration given to future customer demand for our products  obsolescence from rapidly changing technology  and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to increase our inventory provision and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
warranty we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  our gross margin could be adversely affected 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  consolidated statements of operations data revenues  net cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative deferred stock compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues  net 
revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year sales through our main distributors  altisys  ingram micro  and synnex  accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year and approximately  and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year the slight increase in revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the introduction of our altiserv office product which offers our customers a complete system including a chassis with pre installed software and hardware 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal year decreased to million from approximately million in fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues also decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of revenues was high in fiscal year primarily due to write off for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the general downturn in the us economy 
during fiscal year  no additional write offs for excess inventory were required 
management continues to closely monitor the company s inventory levels 
any further declines in demand would result in reduced sales  increased operating losses and additional inventory provisions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the slight decrease was primarily due to slightly lower personnel levels and related expenditures  as well as tighter controls over discretionary spending 
we expect research and development expenses will remain relatively flat due to the uncertainty about customers spending patterns in the current economic environment 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  and promotional expenses 
the decrease was primarily due to significantly lower sales forces expenses resulting from headcount reduction and decreases in promotional and advertising activities 
we expect 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat due to the uncertainty about customers spending patterns in the current economic environment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in legal fees  slightly lower personnel levels and related expenditures  as well as tighter controls over discretionary spending 
consequently in the near term  we expect to maintain general and administrative expenses at the same level 
however  in order to continue to build our infrastructure to support the growth of our business  it may be necessary to increase general and administrative expenses 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was  in fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the aggregate deferred stock compensation charge was reduced during fiscal year by approximately  due to the cancellation of approximately  options associated with employees who are no longer employed by us 
deferred stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges resulting from granting stock options at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates the options were granted 
we are amortizing these deferred amounts using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related stock options 
we expect to expense  in fiscal year which represents amortization of the remaining deferred stock compensation 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to  in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the write down of a long term investment as well as declining interest income from a decrease in invested principal due to cash being used in operations 
we expect net interest and other income to continue to decrease as a result of further decreases in cash available to invest and relatively flat or lower interest rates 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues  net 
revenues consist of sales to end users including resellers and to distributors 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing a decrease of 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of worsened general economic conditions which significantly reduced demand for our phone system products in in addition  we believe that the terrorist attacks of september  caused some of our customers to reduce  cancel or reschedule orders for our products and intensified the economic slowdown 
sales to distributors tech data  altisys  ingram micro  and synnex accounted for approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year and approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year during  we terminated tech data as a distributor of our products and increased sales to altisys  ingram micro and synnex 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal year increased to million from approximately million in fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues also increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to inventory write downs needed to reflect the slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the general downturn in the us economy 
during fiscal year  we increased our provision for excess inventory by million as a result of decreased demand for our products  especially in the second half of fiscal year research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to hiring of additional engineers  related personnel expenses and consultant fees 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  and promotional expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in legal fees as a result of the settlement of litigation with sonoma systems  inc and our effort to reduce cost structure during the current economic downturn 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was  in fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the aggregate deferred stock compensation charge was reduced during fiscal year by approximately  due to the cancellation of approximately  options 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was due to decreases in invested principal due to cash being used in operations as well as a decline in interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
as of september   we had cash and short term investments totaling million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million and million of highly liquid investments 
net cash used in our operating activities was million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected the impact of the net loss for each of the periods  as well as working capital required to fund our growth in operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for fiscal year and million for fiscal year  which was primarily a result of redemption of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million  which was primarily a result of purchases of short and long term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal year which was primarily a result of purchases of treasury stock 
cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal year  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and investments in our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year  which was primarily due to million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock in october we intend to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our products  our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase as well as other factors 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or if sales from our new products are lower than expected  we will be required to make additional reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations 
additional financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may also require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we can not raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may or may not be able to obtain 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of altigen 

table of contents our common stock was transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market at the opening of business on june  and was afforded the remainder of this market s calendar day grace period  or until august   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share requirement  set forth in marketplace rule c d 
pursuant to a letter from nasdaq staff on august   we had not regained compliance in accordance with marketplace rule c d 
however  nasdaq staff noted that we met the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under marketplace rule c a 
specifically  altigen qualified under such requirements by virtue of having at least  of stockholders equity

if compliance with this rule cannot be demonstrated by february   nasdaq staff will provide written notification that our securities will be delisted 
at that time  we may appeal nasdaq staff s determination to a listing qualification panel 
the result of delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market would be a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in our common stock and a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
delisting would reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they could have done in the past 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
although we are working to comply with all continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy such requirements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued sfas no

under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair value based test 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
the company will follow sfas no

sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and the adoption is not expected to have an impact on our historical financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and result of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
risks related to altigen we have a history of losses and expect to incur future losses  which may prevent us from becoming profitable 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses may be substantial 
further  we expect our operating cash flows to be negative for the foreseeable future 
because we expect increased expenditures for product development and general and administrative expenses  and substantial increases in sales and marketing expenses  we will need to increase revenues significantly to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows 
even if we do achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we are unable to comply with nasdaq s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market

the current economic downturn may continue to adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our annual revenue and operating results have and may continue to fluctuate due to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of the economic slowdown and reduced capital spending  particularly in the united states 
we experienced a lower 
table of contents gross margin due to inventory write downs needed to reflect the slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and general downturn in the us economy 
we are uncertain about the extent  severity  and length of the economic downturn 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material negative effects on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and our future prospects 
we shipped our first products in july as a result of our limited operating history  we have limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our business 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and challenges we might encounter because we are at an early stage of development in a new and rapidly evolving market 
to address these risks and achieve profitability and increased sales levels  we must establish and increase market acceptance of our technology  products and systems  expand our network of distributors  dealers and companies that buy our products in bulk  customize them for particular applications or customers  and resell them under their own names  introduce products and systems incorporating our technology and enhancements to our product applications on a timely basis  respond effectively to competitive pressures  and successfully market and support our products and systems 
we may not successfully meet any of these challenges  and our failure to do so will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and harm our business 
our operating results vary  making future operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause our operating results to vary  including our sales cycle  which may vary substantially from customer to customer  unfavorable changes in the prices and delivery of the components we purchase  the size and timing of orders for our products  which may vary depending on the season  and the contractual terms of those orders  the size and timing of our expenses  including operating expenses and expenses of developing new products and product enhancements  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or by our competitors  and our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products 
our budgets and commitments that we have made for the future are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly  and consequently our operating results may suffer 
our dealers often require immediate shipment and installation of our products 
as a result  we have historically operated with limited backlog  and our sales and operating results in any quarter depend primarily on orders booked and shipped during that quarter 

table of contents any of the above factors could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
our market is highly competitive  and we may not have the resources to compete adequately 
the market for our integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors develop new products and new competitors enter the market 
we believe that a critical component to success in this market is the ability to establish and maintain strong partner and customer relationships with a wide variety of domestic and international providers 
if we fail to establish or maintain these relationships  we will be at a serious competitive disadvantage 
we face competition from companies providing traditional private telephone systems 
our principal competitors that produce traditional private telephone systems are avaya communications  nec and nortel networks 
we also compete against providers of multifunction telecommunications systems  including artisoft  inc  shoreline communications  inc  com corporation  and cisco systems  inc  as well as any number of future competitors 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater name recognition  financial  sales and marketing  technical  customer support  manufacturing and other resources 
these competitors may also have more established distribution channels and stronger relationships with service providers 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
these competitors may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less expensive  provide higher performance or additional features or be introduced earlier than our solutions 
we also expect that other companies may enter our market with better products and technologies 
if any technology that is competing with ours is more reliable  faster  less expensive or has other advantages over our technology  then the demand for our products and services could decrease and harm our business 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
a description of our principal competitors and the competitive nature of our market are discussed in greater detail in business competition 
losing any of our key distributors would harm our business 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
sales through our three key distributors  altisys  ingram micro inc and synnex  accounted for of our net revenues in the fiscal year ended september  our business and operating results will suffer if any one of these distributors does not continue distributing our products  fails to distribute the volume of our products that it currently distributes or fails to expand our customer base 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
we may not be able to establish  or successfully manage  relationships with additional distribution partners 
in addition  our agreements with distributors typically provide for termination by either party upon written notice to the other party 
for example  our agreement with ingram micro provides for termination  with or without cause  by either party upon days written notice to the other party  or upon insolvency or bankruptcy 
generally  these agreements are non exclusive and distributors sell products that compete with ours 
if we fail to establish or maintain relationships with distributors and original equipment manufacturers  our ability to increase or maintain our sales and our customer base will be substantially harmed 

table of contents we sell our products through dealers and distributors  which limits our ability to control the timing of our sales  and this makes it more difficult to predict our revenues 
we do not recognize revenue from the sale of our products to our distributors until these products are sold to either resellers or end users 
we have little control over the timing of product sales to dealers and end users 
our lack of control over the revenue which we recognize from our distributors sales to resellers and end users limits our ability to predict revenue for any given period 
our budgets and commitments that we have made for the future are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly  and consequently our operating results may suffer 
we rely on sole sourced components and third party technology and products  if these components are not available  our business may suffer 
we purchase technology from third parties that is incorporated into our products  including virtually all of our hardware products 
we order sole sourced components using purchase orders and do not have supply contracts for them 
one sole sourced component  a ti dsp chip  is particularly important to our business because it is included in virtually all of our hardware products 
if we were unable to purchase an adequate supply of these sole sourced components on a timely basis  we would be required to develop alternative solutions 
this could entail qualifying an alternative source or redesigning our products based on different components 
our inability to obtain these sole sourced components  especially the ti dsp chip  could significantly delay shipment of our products  which could have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and assembly 
we rely on resellers to promote  sell  install and support our products  and their failure to do so may substantially reduce our sales and thus seriously harm our business 
we rely on resellers who can provide high quality sales and support services 
as with our distributors  we compete with other telecommunications systems providers for our resellers business  as our resellers generally market competing products 
if a reseller promotes a competitor s products to the detriment of our products or otherwise fails to market our products and services effectively  we could lose market share 
in addition  the loss of a key reseller or the failure of resellers to provide adequate customer service could cause our business to suffer 
if we do not properly train our reseller to sell  install and service our products  our business will suffer 
software or hardware errors may seriously harm our business and damage our reputation  causing loss of customers and revenues 
users expect telephone systems to provide a high level of reliability 
our products are inherently complex and may have undetected software or hardware errors 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects in our installed base of products  new product releases and product upgrades 
end users may install  maintain and use our products improperly or for purposes for which they were not designed 
these problems may degrade or terminate the operation of our products  which could cause end users to lose telephone service  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  damage our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems 
any significant delay in the commercial introduction of our products due to errors or defects  any design modifications required to correct these errors or defects or any negative effect on customer satisfaction as a result of errors or defects could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any claims brought because of problems with our products or services could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently offer a one year hardware guarantee to end users 
if our products fail within the first year  we face replacement costs 
our insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage should a claim be asserted 
in addition  our introduction of products and systems with reliability  quality or compatibility problems could result in reduced revenues  uncollectible accounts receivable  delays in collecting accounts receivable  warranties and additional costs 
our customers  end users or employees 
table of contents could find errors in our products and systems after we have begun to sell them  resulting in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  their acceptance by the markets in which we compete 
further  we may experience significant product returns in the future 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face infringement issues that could harm our business by requiring us to license technology on unfavorable terms or temporarily or permanently cease sales of key products 
we may become parties to litigation in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex litigation are difficult to predict 
on september   vertical networks  inc filed suit against altigen communications  inc in united states district court for the northern district of california  case no 
c wha  alleging infringement of vertical networks united states patents nos 
    and  on october   vertical networks amended its complaint to add allegations of infringement of patents nos 
 and  vertical networks filed a second amended complaint on november  to identify the altigen products and or activities that allegedly infringe the seven patents in suit 
vertical networks seeks a judgment of patent infringement  damages  including treble damages for alleged willful infringement  and attorneys fees and costs 
altigen filed an answer and counterclaims for declaratory relief on december  altigen believes it has strong defenses and arguments in this dispute and intends to vigorously litigate its position 
more generally  litigation related to these types of claims may require us to acquire licenses under third party patents which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues in the future will come from sales of software applications for our hardware products 
the software market has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of developers intellectual property rights 
this activity is difficult to detect  and legal proceedings to enforce developers intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and substantial costs 
any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and competitive position 
our success depends  to a certain extent  upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  together with non disclosure and invention assignment agreements  to establish and protect the proprietary rights in the technology used in our products 
although we have filed patent applications  we are not certain that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any patents issued will provide commercially significant protection to our technology 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information not covered by patents to which we own rights  may obtain access to our know how or may claim to have issued patents that prevent the sale of one or more of our products 
also  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our proprietary information without our authorization 
further  the laws of some countries  such as those in japan  one of our target markets  may not adequately protect our intellectual property or may be uncertain 
our success also depends on trade secrets that cannot be patented and are difficult to protect 
if we fail to protect our proprietary information effectively  or if third parties use our proprietary technology without authorization  our competitive position and business will suffer 
a description of our dependence on proprietary technology is discussed in greater detail in business intellectual property 

table of contents our products may not meet the legal standards required for their sale in some countries  if we cannot sell our products in these countries  our results of operations may be seriously harmed 
the united states and other countries in which we intend to sell our products have standards for safety and other certifications that must be met for our products to be legally sold in those countries 
we have tried to design our products to meet the requirements of the countries in which we sell or plan to sell them 
we have also obtained or are trying to obtain the certifications that we believe are required to sell our products in these countries 
however  we cannot guarantee that our products meet all of these standards or that we will be able to obtain any certifications required 
in addition  there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the products we offer and may offer in the future 
these laws or regulations may include  for example  more stringent safety standards  requirements for additional or more burdensome certifications or more stringent consumer protection laws 
if our products do not meet a country s standards or we do not receive the certifications required by a country s laws or regulations  then we may not be able to sell those products in that country 
this may seriously harm our results of operation by reducing our sales or requiring us to invest significant resources to conform our products to these standards 
our market is subject to changing preferences  failure to keep up with these changes would result in our losing market share  thus seriously harming our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers and end users expect frequent product introductions and have changing requirements for new products and features 
therefore  to be competitive  we will need to develop and market new products and product enhancements that respond to these changing requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our failure to do so promptly and cost effectively would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  introducing new products could require us to write off existing inventory as obsolete  which could harm our results of operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services 
we may need to seek additional funding in the future 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we may also be required to reduce operating costs through lay offs or reduce our sales and marketing or research and development efforts 
if we issue equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
we may not be successful in managing any future growth 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception 
in order to manage this expansion and to grow in the future  we will need to expand or enhance our management  manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing capabilities 
we may not be able to hire the management  staff or other personnel required to do so 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned operational systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
difficulties in installing and implementing new systems  procedures and controls may significantly burden our management and our internal resources 
delays in the implementation of new systems or operational disruptions when we transition to new systems would impair our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

table of contents lead times for materials and components used in the assembly of our products vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if orders do not match forecasts  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our planned expansion in international markets will involve new risks that our previous domestic operations have not prepared us to address  our failure to address these risks could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our net revenues came from customers outside of the united states 
we intend to expand our international sales and marketing efforts 
our efforts are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks include tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  such as import or export licensing imposed by foreign countries  especially on technology  potential adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could make our products relatively more expensive in foreign markets  and conflicting regulatory requirements in different countries that may require us to invest significant resources customizing our products for each country 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  our failure to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  particularly engineers and sales and marketing personnel 
we need highly trained technical personnel to design and support our server based telecommunications systems 
in addition  we need highly trained sales and marketing personnel to expand our marketing and sales operations in order to increase market awareness of our products and generate increased revenues 
competition for highly trained personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area where most of our operations are located 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in our recruitment and retention efforts 
if we fail to attract or retain qualified personnel or suffer from delays in hiring required personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
our facility is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters and other business interruptions  any such damage could seriously or completely impair our business 
we perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility in fremont  california 
our facility is located on or near known earthquake fault zones and may be subject to rolling electrical blackouts and is vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if such a disaster or interruption occurs  our ability to perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility would be seriously  if not completely  impaired 
if we were unable to obtain an alternative place or way to perform these functions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions 
our strategy to outsource assembly and test functions in the future could delay delivery of products  decrease quality or increase costs 
based on volume or customer requirements  we may begin outsourcing some assembly and test functions 
in addition  we may determine that we need to establish assembly and test operations overseas to better serve our 
table of contents international customers 
establishing overseas assembly and test operations may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
this outsourcing strategy involves certain risks  including the potential lack of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yield  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractor were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or test our products in the required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
finding replacements could take time  and we cannot be sure that additional sources would be available to us on a timely basis 
any delay or increase in costs in the assembly and testing of products by third party subcontractors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing and assembly operations are discussed in greater detail in business manufacturing and assembly 
risks related to the industry integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems may not achieve widespread acceptance 
the market for integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
businesses have invested substantial resources in the existing telecommunications infrastructure  including traditional private telephone systems  and may be unwilling to replace these systems in the near term or at all 
businesses may also be reluctant to adopt integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems because of their concern about the current limitations of data networks  including the internet 
for example  end users sometimes experience delays in receiving calls and reduced voice quality during calls when routing calls over data networks 
moreover  businesses that begin to route calls over the same networks that currently carry only their data may also experience these problems if the networks do not have sufficient capacity to carry all of these communications at the same time 
future regulation or legislation could harm our business or increase our cost of doing business 
in april  the federal communications commission submitted a report to congress stating that it may regulate certain internet services if it determines that such internet services are functionally equivalent to conventional telecommunications services 
the increasing growth of the voice over data network market and the popularity of supporting products and services  however  heighten the risk that national governments will seek to regulate the transmission of voice communications over networks such as the internet 
in addition  large telecommunications companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of this market so as to benefit their interests  which may be contrary to our interests 
these regulations may include  for example  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing tariffs or imposing regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services 
future laws  legal decisions or regulations  as well as changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could require us to expend significant resources to comply with them 
in addition  these future events or changes may create uncertainty in our market that could reduce demand for our products 
evolving standards may delay our product introductions  increase our product development costs or cause end users to defer or cancel plans to purchase our products  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the standards in our market are still evolving 
these standards are designed to ensure that integrated  multifunction telecommunications products from different manufacturers can operate together 
some of these standards are proposed by other participants in our market  including some of our competitors  and include proprietary technology 
in recent years  these standards have changed  and new standards have been proposed  in response to developments in our market 
our failure to conform our products to existing or future standards may limit their acceptance by market participants 
we may not anticipate which standards will achieve the broadest acceptance in our market in the future  and we may take a significant amount of time and expense to adapt our products to these standards 
we may also have to pay additional royalties to developers of proprietary technologies that become standards in our market 
these delays and expenses may seriously harm our results of operations 
in addition  customers and users may defer or cancel plans to purchase our products due to concerns about the ability of our products to conform to existing standards or to adapt to new or changed standards  and this could seriously harm our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest risk 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage the exposure of financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
these securities are highly liquid and generally mature within months from the purchase date 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed an analysis to assess the potential effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of any change in foreign currency exchange rates is not expected to be material to our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rate would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
