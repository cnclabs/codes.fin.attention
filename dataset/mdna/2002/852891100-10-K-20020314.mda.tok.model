critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements and certain disclosures made in this form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company believes the estimates most susceptible to material changes the critical accounting policies are those used in determining the recognition of premiums  liabilities for future policy benefits and claims  deferred policy acquisition costs  and the provision for income taxes 
estimates related to critical accounting policies involve significant judgment 
changes in such estimates may affect amounts reported in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
premiums from group life  group and individual disability insurance  and traditional life insurance contracts are recognized as revenue when due 
benefits and expenses are matched with recognized premiums to result in recognition of profits over the life of the contracts 
this match is accomplished by recording a provision for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and by amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs 
universal life type and investment type contract premiums and other policy fee revenues consist of charges for policy administration and surrender charges assessed during the period 
charges related to services to be performed are deferred until earned 
the amounts received in excess of premiums and fees are included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated balance sheets 
experience rated refunds are computed in accordance with the terms of the contracts with certain group policyholders and are accounted for as a reduction of premiums 
actuarially determined reserves are established and carried at amounts that are calculated to meet obligations for future policy benefits and claims 
the reserves are computed at amounts that  with additions from premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death or disability 
reserves include unearned premiums  premium deposits  claims reported but not yet paid  claims incurred but not reported  and claims in the process of settlement 
reserves are based on actuarially recognized methods for developing assumptions for estimating future policy benefits and claims experience  including an evaluation of interest rates  mortality  morbidity  persistency and expenses 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed on bases essentially comparable to direct insurance reserves 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims  the amounts which will ultimately be paid to settle the liability cannot be determined precisely and may vary from the estimated amounts 
reserves for future policy benefits and claims are periodically evaluated 
based on changes in the assumptions used to establish the reserves  as well as actual policy benefits and claims experience  adjustments are made when appropriate 
the establishment of reserves and subsequent increases or decreases are charged as expense in the period the reserves are established  increased  or decreased 
acquisition costs related to the production of new business have been deferred to accomplish matching against related future premiums and gross profits 
such costs may include commissions and incentive payments  certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain variable field office expenses 
deferred costs associated with group life and disability insurance products are amortized in proportion to future premiums over periods that generally range from five to ten years 
individual disability insurance product costs are amortized in proportion to future premiums over the life of the contract generally ranging from to years 
for individual deferred annuities  group annuities and investment type contracts  the costs are amortized in proportion to expected gross profits over periods that generally range from to years 
the discount rate applied to expected gross profits is revised for actual changes in credited interest rates 
deferred policy acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent it is determined that future premiums or gross profits are not adequate to cover amounts deferred 
the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable  and deferred amounts that result from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current tax rates and laws 
if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance will be established 
amounts provided for uncertainties and adjustments primarily reflect uncertainties related to the use of estimates and the subsequent resolution of those uncertainties 
resolution occurs when amounts provided on an estimated basis are known or when the tax year closes 
acquisition and disposition of product lines effective october   standard insurance company standard acquired a substantial block of individual disability insurance business  through a reinsurance transaction  from minnesota life insurance company minnesota life 
standard paid a ceding commission of approximately million and received approximately million in assets and corresponding liabilities 
in accordance with the agreement with minnesota life  standard established a trust for the benefit of minnesota life 
the market value of assets required to be maintained in the trust at december  was million 
accompanying this transaction was an agreement that provides access to minnesota life agents who now market standard s individual disability insurance products 
effective january   standard sold its individual life insurance business to protective life insurance company protective life through a reinsurance transaction 
standard received a ceding commission of approximately million and transferred to protective life approximately million in assets and corresponding liabilities 
if protective life becomes unable to meet its obligations  standard would retain the reinsured liabilities 
therefore  the reinsured liabilities remain on standard s books and an equal amount is recorded as a recoverable from reinsurer 
in accordance with the agreement  protective life established a trust for the benefit of standard with assets in the trust required to be equal to standard s reinsurance receivable from protective life

policyholder benefits  including interest on policyholder funds policyholder benefits include changes in the liability for future policy benefits and claims see critical accounting policies and estimates 
policyholder benefits are affected by claims experience  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
policyholder benefits  including million in pre tax charges incurred as a result of the terrorist events of september  increased million  or  in compared to the increase resulted primarily from business growth  as evidenced by premium growth  in the employee benefits insurance segment  which was offset in part by a net decrease in policyholder benefits in the individual insurance segment as a result of the combined effect of two reinsurance transactions 
see selected segment information 
policyholder benefits increased million  or  in compared to the increase resulted primarily from business growth  as evidenced by premium growth  in the employee benefits insurance segment 
methods used by the company to manage risk include  but are not limited to  sound product design and underwriting  effective claims management  disciplined pricing  distribution expertise  broad distribution of risk by geography  industry  occupation  customer size and salary range  and maintenance of a strong balance sheet 
as a part of risk management  the company has maintained reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance in the past for protection from fluctuations 
subsequent to the events of september  the company entered into a catastrophe reinsurance pool 
the pool covers group life and accidental death and dismemberment for about participating members of the pool 
the reinsurance pool brings exposure to potential losses experienced by other participating members of the pool but substantially increases the company s catastrophe reinsurance coverage to approximately million per event 
if the company had been in the pool on september   the estimated pre tax charges related to the terrorist events would have been approximately million compared to pre tax charges of million actually incurred 
an occurrence of a significant catastrophic event  or a change in the on going nature and availability of reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to the increases for both comparative periods were primarily from operating expense growth in the employee benefits insurance segment to support business growth as evidenced by premium growth 
operating expenses have generally been managed to a rate of growth less than the rate of premium growth 
however  the margin between the rate of operating expense growth and the rate of premium growth has fluctuated from year to year 
in operating expense growth was unusually low compared to premium growth 
management believes that this unusually favorable margin between operating expense growth and premium growth may not be maintained in due to the possibility that the rate of premium growth in may be at a lower level than achieved in a reduction in the rate of premium growth could be caused by economic uncertainties  including higher levels of national unemployment and caution on the part of employers when introducing new employee benefits 
over time  however  management continues to expect that operating expenses will grow at a rate that is less than the rate of premium growth 
commissions and bonuses commissions and bonuses primarily represent sales based compensation that vary depending on the product  whether the sale is in its first year or a renewal year  and other factors 
therefore  commissions will tend to fluctuate with premiums  but not directly 
commissions and bonuses increased million  or  for compared to  and increased million  or  for compared to the increases for both comparable periods were primarily due to increased sales for disability income and annuity products in the individual insurance segment see selected segment information 
net increase in deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the net reduction in expense for deferral and amortization of policy acquisition costs was million for compared to million for  and million in the net reduction in expense for both comparative periods resulted primarily from deferral of higher commissions in the individual insurance segment related to the two reinsurance transactions see commissions and bonuses and selected segment information individual insurance segment 
management anticipates the rate of growth in the net reduction in expense for deferral and amortization of policy acquisition costs to approximate the rate of premium growth 
income taxes total income taxes differ from the amount computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of because of the net result of permanent differences and the inclusion of state and local income taxes  net of the federal benefit 
the combined federal and state effective tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the higher effective rate in compared to resulted primarily from a change in the tax return filing status and amounts provided for uncertainties 
the lower effective rate in compared to resulted primarily from reorganization expenses in  which generally were not deductible
