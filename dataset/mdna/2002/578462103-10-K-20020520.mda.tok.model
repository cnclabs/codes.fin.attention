item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the discussion and analysis below contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of certain factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the years ended february   february  and january  are referred to herein as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the success of the company s operations depends to a certain extent on the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic in the vicinity of the mayor s stores 
the loss of mall anchor tenants in the regional malls where the mayor s stores are located  the opening of competing regional malls or other economic downturns affecting customer mall traffic could have an adverse effect on the company s net sales and profitability 
the retail jewelry business is seasonal in nature with a higher proportion of sales and a significant portion of earnings generated during the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
restructuring plan mayor s jewelers operated luxury jewelry stores in ten states as of february  the desert passage store in las vegas  nevada was closed in march  merchandising and marketing issues  the poor economic climate and a capital intensive expansion strategy that the company executed in fiscal through fiscal  were dominant factors in contributing to the company s poor operating performance for fiscal these results have drained the company of significant amounts of capital  which in turn has required mayor s to restructure itself in an effort to position the company for future profitability 
accordingly during fiscal  mayor s adopted a multi faceted restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan includes the hiring of a new ceo with extensive merchandising and marketing experience  an infusion of capital  the refinancing or restructuring of the company s million bank facility  the closure of unprofitable stores and termination of three leases for stores that are not yet built  the remerchandising of its core florida and georgia stores  the termination of redundant employees and the disposition of certain non performing assets 
as part of its restructuring plan  on may   mayor s executed an agreement in principle the agreement with henry birks sons holdings inc of canada birks 
the agreement provides for birks to invest in or cause to be provided to mayor s million in cash 
upon completion of the transaction  birks will receive preferred stock that will be convertible into common stock of mayor s generally representing of the common stock on a fully diluted basis 
prior to conversion  birks will be able to elect a majority of the board of directors of mayor s 
birks will also receive warrants to purchase an additional of the common stock on a fully diluted basis at an exercise price of 
per share 
mayor s and birks will enter into a series of agreements through which birks will provide management  merchandising and sales support to mayor s 
completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions  including without limitation  execution of definitive agreements which the parties hope to accomplish in june and the affirmative vote of the stockholders of mayor s at a meeting of stockholders to be held as soon as practicable 
pending the closing  birks will provide consulting services to mayor s pursuant to a consulting agreement 
the company continues to work on the refinancing of a senior revolving facility for which refinancing it has a commitment letter subject to certain future developments 
until the time a refinancing is in place  the company will continue to operate under an amendment to its existing working facility and may seek extensions of such amendment 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its refinancing efforts 
a significant condition to any investment by birks and any refinancing will be the payment of the exit costs for the closing of unprofitable stores and the termination of three lease commitments for stores that have not been built 
the unprofitable stores include properties outside of the company s core florida and georgia marketplace as well as two stores in florida 
the nevada store was closed in march  see item properties 
the closing of these stores marks a significant retrenchment of the company s recent expansion strategy into states where mayor s does not enjoy the brand loyalty that it has enjoyed in the southeast us the three lease commitments for stores that are not built include one in ohio and two in florida 
while the company believes the two florida locations would enhance the company s core market  their construction is dependent upon funding of additional capital resources in order to fund their construction 
the company believes short term growth will come from rebuilding the company s presence within existing markets where mayor s has enjoyed strong brand recognition 
if the company successfully executes its restructuring plan  the company may consider limited growth opportunities including acquisitions of  or investments in businesses similar or complimentary to that of the company 
in the event the company is unable to successfully implement its restructuring plan  its business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  failure to obtain adequate funding will most probably prevent the company from being able to pay its fiscal debt service obligations and sustain the company s working capital needs 
in this event  there would be substantial doubt that the company would be able to continue operations in the normal course of business at which time the company would have to consider all of its alternatives 
as the company refocuses on its core business  it hopes to execute a productive merchandising strategy in its remaining stores 
the company believes that with the appropriate capital resources that the above mentioned investment will hopefully provide  it will be able to execute initiatives that will drive the business toward positive comparable store sales results  although there can be no assurance that such results shall occur

comparative store net sales for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales for fiscal is due to merchandising and marketing issues coupled with the slowdown of the economy and the effects that the tragic events of september th had on the company s retail environment 
comparative store net sales for fiscal increased compared to fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal is due to revenue contribution of new stores as well as the comparable store sales increase  created in part because of the fifty three week calendar for fiscal the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased 
with the consolidation of the retail industry  the company believes that competition both within the luxury goods retail industry and with other competing general and specialty retailers and discounters will continue to increase 
the luxury watch brands business comprises a significant portion of the mayor s business  which is a result of the company s ability to effectively market high end watches 
rolex has informed the company that its account has been placed on hold status 
in the event that rolex does not lift the hold and begin accepting new orders for watches or if rolex terminates its distribution agreement with the company  it would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
moreover  certain of the company s vendors have expressed some concerns about the company s current financial condition 
if such vendors terminated their relationships with the company  it could also have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
please refer to item regarding forward looking statements 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal is primarily due to the liquidation of slow moving and discontinued inventory through caravan events that traveled through various stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal is a primarily because of improvements achieved through sales and purchasing efficiencies and merchandise management initiatives that improved initial markup and inventory management 
if the restructuring plan is successful  the company is hopeful that the opportunity exists to increase gross profit over the next couple of years 
areas for gross margin improvement include strategies to lower the cost of merchandise purchased and to move the mix of sales towards higher margin jewelry items 
in addition  the company expects to refine the allocation and management of inventory in its stores  and as a result  other direct costs such as slow moving reserves are expected to decrease 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase gross profit 
store operating and selling expenses store operating and selling expenses were million  or of sales for fiscal compared to million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

the decrease in store operating and selling costs as a percentage of sales for fiscal over fiscal is a result of increased comparable store sales

the company does not believe there is significant opportunity to reduce these expenses other than the decrease that will occur as a result of the closing stores as discussed under restructuring plan above 
store contribution store contribution fell to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal primarily because of the lack of profitability of the company s newly constructed stores and reduction in same store sales

these costs are expensed as incurred 
advertising and marketing expenses advertising and marketing expenses were million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to a watch and bridal book that was produced that fiscal year

the company continues to work on the refinancing of a senior revolving facility  depending upon successful negotiation of the revolving credit and security agreement 
until the time a refinancing is in place  the company will continue to operate under an amendment to its existing working facility which expires may  and may seek extensions of such amendment 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its refinancing efforts 
the failure to obtain adequate funding will most probably prevent the company from being able to pay its fiscal debt services obligations and sustain the company s working capital needs 
in this event  there would be substantial doubt that the company would be able to continue operations in the normal course of business at which time the company would have to consider all of its alternatives 
the company currently has an million working capital facility with a syndicate of lenders 
availability under this facility is determined based upon a percentage formula applied to inventory and accounts receivable 
this working capital facility was amended in september after the company s second quarter of fiscal operating performance caused it to fail to comply with certain financial covenants of the facility 
at that time the facility was amended to waive all financial covenants for the second quarter as well as for the remainder of fiscal as consideration for this amendment  the company agreed to increase the interest margin from libor plus to libor plus 
the rate on the facility as of february  was 
further  as conditions for the amendment  the company agreed to restrictions regarding borrowing availability  which included requiring the company to provide the bank group with an million cushion on the lesser of collateral availability or the million cap provided for by the facility 
this amendment had an original expiration of april  however  on april   the company executed an additional amendment to extend the deadline for restructuring the facility from april  to may  as of february   after accounting for the foregoing borrowing restrictions  the company had approximately million of borrowing capacity and  after netting the outstanding borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of  the company had a net borrowing availability of approximately million 
additionally  because the company has experienced deterioration in its leverage ratio  its commitment fee has been raised to 
from 
and it also pays a fee on outstanding letters of credit 
the working capital facility also currently contains financial covenants that limit capital expenditures  limit incurring of additional debt and prohibits the payment of dividends 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the foregoing covenants 
the company presented its restructuring plan to its bank group on april  the plan outlined several initiatives including the need to fund the exit from unprofitable stores  the need to fund current operating losses and the purchases of inventories needed to remerchandise the stores in its core florida and georgia markets 
the plan also indicated that the sources of capital for these funding requirements would come from selling the company s headquarters  obtaining certain presently restricted cash assets and from outside additional debt and equity capital 
accordingly  the company has asked for and received from the bank group an amendment to extend the deadline from april  to may  for restructuring the working capital facility 
the company currently is in negotiation with birks to participate in the funding of this requirement  however  no assurances can be made that management will succeed in its efforts 
failure to do so will not allow the company to execute its restructuring plan 
further  it will most probably prohibit the company from being able to sustain fiscal debt service and working capital needs 
in this event  there would be substantial doubt that the company would be able to continue operations in the normal course of business at which time the company would have to consider all of its alternatives 
during fiscal  cash flows from continuing operating activities provided million in cash 
cash flows net of discontinued operations used million in cash 
the company s business is highly seasonal 
consequently  seasonal working capital needs peak in october and november  before the holiday shopping season 
during fiscal  these seasonal needs and the company s additional stores opened during fiscal were supplied primarily by the company s cash from operating activities 
during fiscal  the company s peak level of inventory for both continuing and discontinued operations was million requiring a maximum outstanding borrowing on the line of credit of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily related to capital expenditures for seven new stores opened in fiscal capital expenditures also include back office computer software and hardware 
on april   the company s board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase the company s common stock over a period of one year 
on october   the authorized amount to repurchase was increased by an additional million  which has subsequently increased another million to a total of million 
the acquired shares will be held in treasury or canceled 
as of february   the company had repurchased  shares at a cost of million  all held in treasury 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges merchandising and marketing issues and the poor economic climate combined with a capital intensive expansion strategy that the company executed in fiscal through fiscal  were dominant factors in contributing to the company s poor operating performance in fiscal the results have drained the company of significant amounts of capital which in turn has required mayor s to restructure itself in an effort to position the company for future profitability 
accordingly during fiscal  the company adopted a multi faceted restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan includes the hiring of a new ceo with a strong background in merchandising  an infusion of capital  the refinancing or other working out of the company s million bank facility  the closure of unprofitable stores and termination of three leases for stores that are not yet built  the re merchandising of its core florida and georgia stores  the termination of redundant employees and the disposition of certain non performing assets 
the restructuring plan is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal a summary of the charges recorded in fiscal is as follows in thousands restructuring  write down of assets  goodwill impairment write off  other charges  the restructuring costs include employee severance costs of approximately million and total costs to exit stores including lease termination and professional fees of million 
as of february   an accrual of million remained for restructuring costs expected to be paid in fiscal the write down of assets includes million for the write down of leasehold improvements and assets related to the closing locations and million for the write down of the corporate headquarters building and related assets to reflect their estimated fair value determined by comparable market information 
these assets will be taken out of service at the time properties are vacated and consequently will not be depreciated further after they are vacated 
depreciation expense related to these assets was approximately million annually 
the restructuring plan included the elimination of approximately positions in the field and the closure of locations during fiscal the nevada location was closed in march the goodwill impairment of million is a write off of goodwill associated with the mayor s acquisition 
management determined that the long term future cash flows did not support the carrying value and recorded an impairment charge to take the goodwill to zero 
other charges consist of one time charges of million for strategic cost reduction  million for non recurring legal fees associated with shareholder related matters  and million related to severance 
effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net income are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
the company does not hedge its gold inventories 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
interest rate risk the company s credit facility accrues interest at floating rates  currently based upon libor plus or the bank s adjusted base rate plus  at the company s option 
the company manages its borrowings under this credit facility each day in order to minimize interest expense 
the impact on the company s earnings per share of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance as of february  would increase or decrease earnings per share by 
per share 
the company extends credit to its mayor s customers under its own revolving charge plan with up to two year payment terms 
finance charges are generally currently assessed on customers balances at a rate of per month 
since the interest rate is fixed at the time of sale  market interest rate changes would not impact the company s finance charge income 
forward looking statements this report and other written reports and releases and oral statements made from time to time by the company contain forward looking statements which can be identified by their use of words like plans  expects  believes  will  anticipates  intends  projects  estimates  could  would  may  planned  goal  and other words of similar meaning 
all statements that address expectations  possibilities or projections about the future  including without limitation  statements about the company s strategies for growth  expansion plans  sources or adequacy of capital  expenditures and financial results are forward looking statements 
one must carefully consider such statements and understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements  such as inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties  some known and some unknown 
no forward looking statement is guaranteed and actual results may vary materially 
such statements are made as of the date provided  and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect future developments or circumstances 
one should carefully evaluate such statements by referring to the factors described in the company s filings with the sec  especially on form s k  q and k 
particular review is to be made of items   and of the form k and item of the form s q where the company discusses in more detail various important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results 
the company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation act of since it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors  the identified items are not a complete statement of all risks or uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results may differ from those estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note e to the financial statements 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies below 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory or obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
accrued restructuring estimates 
the company has recorded a reserve for the early termination of the leases  legal fees and store closing costs for stores that are scheduled to be closed as discussed previously 
the company s accrual for lease liabilities could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
these factors are significantly dependent on the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
while management believes that the current estimates of discontinued operations liabilities are adequate  it is possible that future events could require the company to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of mayor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required
