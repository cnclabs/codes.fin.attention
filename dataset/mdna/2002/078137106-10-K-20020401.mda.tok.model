item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a under the securities act of and section e under the securities exchange act of such statements include but are not limited to statements regarding the ability to obtain favorable product allocations and the ability to increase gross profit while controlling expenses 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  including those risks described under risk factors in item hereof 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition bell s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
under specific conditions  we permit our customers to return or exchange products 
the provision for estimated returns is recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memo data 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in  our bad debt expense was million compared to million in in addition  included in charges were million of charges recorded in the third quarter and included in restructuring and special charges that related to a rapid deterioration in the financial condition of certain customers resulting in their inability to make payments 
valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions 
our inventories include high technology components that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
during the second and third quarters of we recorded million of charges against inventory related to excess inventory on hand 
the additional write down resulted from market conditions and the decision to discontinue certain product lines 
these charges were included in the statement of income within the caption cost of sales 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate we may be required to take additional inventory write downs in the future 
similarly  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued due to write downs below market value  we would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological development could have a material and significant impact on the future value of our inventory and reported operating results 
valuation of accounts payable our accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns  price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by us and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  our estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by our vendors 
accounting for income taxes bell has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets of million as the company considers it more likely than not that the full balance will be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   goodwill amounted to million and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the carrying value of intangibles or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize our goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge  however  there can be no assurance that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in future periods

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas the company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas in its first quarter ended march  the company is in the process of preparing for its adoption of sfas and is making the determinations as to what its reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets  and liabilities should be allocated to those reporting units 
the company expects that it will no longer record million of amortization per year relating to its existing goodwill of million 
in preparation for the adoption of fas  the company is in the process of evaluating the useful lives of its existing intangible assets and anticipates that any changes in the useful lives will not have a material impact on the results of its operations 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
the company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of sfas will be completed during the first quarter of any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter the company does not expect that these impairment tests will result in a material impact on the company s earnings and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate credit facilities and could be subjected to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
average borrowings outstanding on the variable rate credit facility with first union national bank were million for the year ended december  and average borrowings under ideal s borrowing facility with lombard natwest were million for the year ended  the first union facility and the natwest facility have interest rates that are based on associated rates such as eurodollar and base or prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on changes in the economic environment 
based on actual borrowings throughout the year under the first union facility and the natwest facility  an increase of in such interest rate percentages would increase the annual interest expense by approximately million 
a substantial part of the company s revenue and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars  but the functional currency for foreign subsidiaries is not the us dollar 
as a result of the company or its subsidiaries entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  the company recognized a foreign currency remeasurement loss of  during the year ended december  the company enters into foreign forward exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts are largely offset by gains or losses on the underlying transactions and  consequently  a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates should not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
to the extent the company is unable to manage these risks  the company s results and financial position could be materially adversely affected
