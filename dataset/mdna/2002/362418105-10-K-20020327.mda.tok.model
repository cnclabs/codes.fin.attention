item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a reit focused within the multifamily industry in demand driven markets throughout the united states that have high job growth and are resilient to economic downturns 
our operating performance relies predominantly on net operating income from our apartment communities 
net operating income is determined by rental revenues and operating expenses  which are affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets 
our performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and our ability to develop and acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of our blended cost of capital 
business objectives and strategy our objective is to increase shareholder value by producing consistent high quality earnings to sustain dividend growth and annual total returns that exceed the multifamily sector average 
to achieve that objective  we employ a number of business strategies 
first  our long term investment strategy is research driven  with the objective of creating a portfolio of high quality assets in approximately six to eight strategically selected markets that are complementary through economic diversity and characterized by high job growth and resiliency to national economic downturns 
we believe such a portfolio will provide predictable growth in operating cash flow on a sustainable basis 
second  we adhere to a strategy of owning and operating high quality  class aa a apartment communities under the gables brand 
we believe that such communities  when located in highly desirable areas to live and supplemented with high quality service and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice who is willing to pay a premium for location preference  superior service and high quality communities 
the resulting portfolio should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates 
this  coupled with more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements associated with high quality construction materials  should lead to operating margins that exceed national averages for the multifamily sector and sustainable growth in operating cash flow 
third  our aim is to be recognized as the employer of choice within the industry 
our mission of taking care of the way people live is a cornerstone of our strategy  involving innovative human resource practices that we believe will attract and retain the highest caliber associates 
because of our long established presence as a fully integrated apartment management  development  construction  acquisition and disposition company within our markets  we have the ability to offer multi faceted career opportunities among the various disciplines within the industry 
finally  our capital strategy is to maximize return on invested capital while maintaining financial flexibility through a conservative  investment grade credit profile 
we judiciously manage our capital and are able to recycle existing capital through asset dispositions 
we believe the successful execution of these strategies will result in operating cash flow and dividend growth  producing annual total returns that exceed the multifamily reit sector average 
we believe we are well positioned to continue achieving our objectives because of our long established presence as a fully integrated real estate company in our markets 
this local market presence creates a competitive advantage in generating increased cash flow from property operations during different economic cycles and new investment opportunities that involve site selection  market information and requests for entitlements and zoning petitions 
portfolio wide occupancy levels have remained high  but portfolio wide rental rate growth slowed in as a result of national economic weakness 
we expect portfolio wide rental expenses to increase at a rate ahead of both inflation and property revenues for the upcoming year 
our ongoing evaluation of the growth prospects for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
in that event  we would intend to sell the asset and utilize the net proceeds from any such sale to invest in new assets expected to have better growth prospects  reduce indebtedness or  in certain circumstances with appropriate approval from our board of trustees  repurchase outstanding common shares 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet existing construction  acquisition and leasing activities 
when market conditions warrant  we adjust staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements our financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
note also includes a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements 
our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
as an owner  operator and developer of apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to cost capitalization and asset impairment evaluation 
cost capitalization as a vertically integrated real estate company  we have in house investment professionals involved in development  construction and acquisition 
we include direct costs associated with development and construction activities in the capitalized development cost of wholly owned assets 
we charge direct costs associated with development and construction activities for third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures against our revenues from the services being provided 
such costs are ultimately reflected in net development revenues using the percentage of completion method 
as required by gaap  we expense all internal costs associated with the acquisition of operating apartment communities to general and administrative expense in the period such costs are incurred 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet existing development  construction and acquisition activities 
when market conditions warrant  we adjust staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations 
our real estate development pursuits are subject to permits and other governmental approvals  as well as our ongoing business review of the underlying real estate fundamentals and the impact on our capital structure 
we do not always move forward with development of our real estate pursuits  and therefore  we evaluate the viability of real estate pursuits and the recoverability of capitalized pursuit costs regularly 
based on this periodic review  we expense any costs that are deemed unrealizable at that time to general and administrative expense 
during the development and construction of a new apartment community  we capitalize related interest costs  as well as other carrying costs such as property taxes and insurance 
we begin to expense these items as the construction of the community becomes substantially complete and the residential apartment homes become available for initial management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data occupancy 
accordingly  we gradually reduce the amounts we capitalize as construction is being completed 
during the lease up period  as a community transitions from initial occupancy to stabilized occupancy  revenues are generally insufficient to cover interest  carrying costs and operating expenses 
the size and duration of this lease up deficit depends on how quickly construction is completed  how quickly the apartments available for occupancy are leased  and what rent levels are achieved at the community 
asset impairment evaluation under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
as noted above  the cost of buildings and improvements includes interest  property taxes  insurance  and allocated development overhead incurred during the construction period 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  major replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of years for buildings and improvements and years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
as required by gaap  we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying value and record impairment losses if there are indicators of impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
at december   we did not own any real estate assets that meet the impairment criteria 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data results of operations comparison of operating results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net income is generated primarily from the operation of our apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  we categorize our operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
a community is considered to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy or one year after completion of construction 
the operating performance for all of our apartment communities combined for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows years ended december  change change rental and other property revenues same store communities a communities stabilized during  but not b development and lease up communities c renovation communities d acquired communities e sold communities f total property revenues property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization same store communities a communities stabilized during  but not b development and lease up communities c renovation communities d acquired communities e sold communities f total specified expenses revenues in excess of specified expenses revenues in excess of specified expenses as a percentage of total property revenues a communities that were owned and stabilized throughout both and same store

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of the reit s ordinary taxable income to shareholders 
it is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed taxable income

we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  restrictive covenants certain of our debt agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default  including covenants which restrict the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts our discretion to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year  the operating partnership may only distribute up to of its consolidated income available for distribution as defined in the related agreement  exclusive of distributions of capital gains for such year 
the applicable debt agreements contain exceptions to these limitations to allow the operating partnership to make any distributions necessary to allow us to maintain our status as a reit 
we do not anticipate that this provision will adversely effect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions or our ability to declare dividends  under our current dividend policy 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data inflation substantially all leases at our communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable us to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to lessen the impact of cost increases arising from inflation

management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund distributions and capital expenditures 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
effective january   nareit amended its definition of ffo to include in ffo all non recurring items  except those defined as extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
we are using the amended definition of ffo in reporting our results for all periods on or after january  in addition  we have restated ffo reported for prior periods 
ffo as defined by nareit represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  our ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the amended nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less recurring  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures 
ffo and affo should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our cash needs and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our capital structure includes the use of variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
as such  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
we periodically seek input from third party consultants regarding market interest rate and credit risk in order to evaluate our interest rate exposure 
in certain situations  we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of rate caps  rate swaps or rate locks to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we do not utilize such instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not have any derivative instruments in place at december  or we typically refinance maturing debt instruments at then existing market interest rates and terms which may be more or less than the interest rates and terms on the maturing debt 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates in effect at december  by expected maturity dates 
the indebtedness outstanding under each of our credit facilities is reflected in the table using the may maturity date of our million credit facility 
the weighted average interest rates presented in this table are inclusive of credit enhancement fees 
there have been no substantial changes in our market risk profile from the preceding year and the assumptions are consistent with prior year assumptions
