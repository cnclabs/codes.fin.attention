liquidity and capital resources generally  cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet current operating requirements 
a significant portion of nisource s operations  most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses  are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow 
during the heating season  which is primarily from november through march  cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements 
in the summer months  cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements 
also  during the summer months  cash on hand  together with external short term and long term financing  is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries  perform necessary maintenance of facilities  make capital improvements in plant  and expand service into new areas 
credit facilities on november   nisource completed the acquisition of columbia for approximately billion plus the assumption of approximately billion of columbia debt 
the acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new holding company 
to complete the acquisition of columbia  nisource  through nisource finance  arranged a billion day acquisition facility with a syndicate of banks 
on november   the closing date of the acquisition  the facility supported billion of commercial paper issued to finance the columbia acquisition 
subsequent to the november  columbia acquisition  nisource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the issuance of billion of privately placed notes completed on november  this issuance included million of three year notes paying a coupon and maturing on november   million of five year notes paying a coupon and maturing on november  and billion of ten year notes paying a coupon and maturing on november  subsequently  an additional million of five year notes were issued  bearing a coupon and maturing on november  on november   nisource issued  new shares of nisource common stock at an offering price of per share 
the million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper 
during march  nisource arranged billion in revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements  providing back stop support for nisource s commercial paper program 
the new facility consolidated essentially all of nisource s existing short term credit facilities into one credit facility 
the billion credit facility consists of a billion day facility that terminates on march  and a billion facility that terminates on march  on april   nisource finance issued million of unsecured two year notes guaranteed by nisource  paying a coupon and maturing on april  the proceeds were used to repay commercial paper 
as a means of further improving the balance sheet  nisource intends to improve liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the indianapolis water company and sm p  the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the indiana utility regulatory commission 
additionally  nisource is currently evaluating the appropriate dollar commitment level  if any  to be renewed under the day facility on march  nisource has begun preparation for the facility renewal and syndication process

credit ratings on december  fitch ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of nisource inc and its subsidiaries 
fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at nisource  resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a bbb rating category  rather than the previous bbb rating 
at the same time  fitch also assigned a stable ratings outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries 
on february   fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of nisource inc and its subsidiaries  but revised the company s ratings outlook from stable to negative 
in january  standard and poor s affirmed nisource s bbb credit rating and its a commercial paper rating with a negative outlook 
on december   moody s investors service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of nisource inc and its subsidiaries 
moody s stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was nisource s higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the company s operating results 
immediately following the moody s ratings watch action  the company s ability to rollover maturities within the a p commercial paper market was significantly constrained 
as a result  the company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the moody s ratings watch action 
at december   million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through nisource s revolving credit facility 
on february   moody s downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of nisource and nisource finance to baa and the commercial paper rating of nisource finance to p in addition  moody s downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to baa to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parent s ratings going forward 
as a split rated a p commercial paper issuer  the company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets 
moody s also revised the company s outlook from stable to negative 
nisource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below bbb at standard and poor s or baa at moody s 
the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately million to million 
in addition to agreements with ratings triggers  there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions 
the collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately million to million 
in the case of nisource s primary energy subsidiaries  ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects 
one other primary energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below ba by moody s or bb by standard and poor s 
the letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of million to million depending on the extent of the downgrade 
columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements 
the surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with mahonia ii limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of columbia falls below bbb at standard and poor s or baa at moody s 
columbia s long term debt ratings are currently bbb and baa at standard and poor s and moody s  respectively 
the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately million declining over time 
in another  but unrelated transaction  the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement  has asked that nisource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately million declining over time to support the bonds 
nisource will comply with this request 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
columbia of ohio is a party to an agreement to sell  without recourse  substantially all of its trade receivables to columbia accounts receivable corporation carc  a wholly owned subsidiary of columbia 
carc  in turn  is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit 
under these agreements  carc may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if columbia s debt rating falls below bbb or baa at standard and poor s and moody s  respectively 
in addition  if columbia s debt rating falls below investment grade  the agreements terminate and carc may not sell any new receivables to the conduit 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments nisource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond these commitments include long term debt  lease obligations  primarily operating leases related to the company s primary energy subsidiaries  and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity  transportation and storage services through the company s gas distribution subsidiaries 
the total contractual cash obligations in existence at december  due pursuant to contractual commitments are in millions after long term debt    capital leases operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations    nisource also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include lines of credit  letters of credit and financing guarantees 
the total commercial commitments in existence at december  and the years in which they expire are in millions after lines of credit  letters of credit guarantees   total commercial commitments    capital expenditures the table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for and and an estimate for year in millions e gas distribution transmission storage electric exploration production merchant other total for  capital expenditures were million  an increase of million over these figures are not directly comparable due to the columbia acquisition on november  columbia s capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the financial statements 
the gas distribution segment s capital program in included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets  as well as expenditures to ensure safe  reliable and improved service to customers 
the transmission and storage segment spent million in to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines 
the remaining million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives 
the electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment 
the exploration and production segment s program primarily included the drilling of new wells in the appalachian basin and canada 
other products and services comprised of million for the completion of transcom s fiber optics network  million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
for  the projected capital program is expected to be million  which is million lower than the level 
this reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of nisource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments 
the program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions 
all estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  acquisition opportunities  market volatility and economic trends 
enron bankruptcy filing on december   enron corp 
filed for protection from creditors under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
nisource has certain exposure to enron  as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to enron at nisource s gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries 
prior to enron s bankruptcy filing  nisource had basis and commodity swaps  pipeline transportation and storage agreements  physical commodity contracts for natural gas  electricity and coal  and so trading agreements in place with enron as the counterparty 
all contracts  with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the columbia of ohio gas distribution subsidiary  were terminated by nisource at the end of november nisource recorded a pre tax charge of million in related to the enron bankruptcy filing 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions risk is an inherent part of nisource s energy businesses and activities 
the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability 
nisource seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in nisource s energy businesses commodity market risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
risk management at nisource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
nisource s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business  nisource s risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
through its various business activities  nisource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks 
the non trading risks to which nisource is exposed include interest rate risk  commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries 
the risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks 
nisource s risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk  including futures  forwards  options and swaps 
risk management at nisource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives 
nisource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks  including value at risk var and instrument sensitivity to market factors 
var represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
non trading risks commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries is limited  since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power  fuel and gas costs through the rate making process 
as the utility industry undergoes deregulation  these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk 
nisource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes  which are ultimately dependent upon the customer s supply requirements 
nisource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
nisource s exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices 
in order to help minimize this risk  nisource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow  favorable prices and margins 
nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit  which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates  and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets 
at december  and december   the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled  million and  million  respectively 
based upon average borrowings under these agreements during and  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by million and million for the year ended and  respectively 
nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its primary energy subsidiary 
a portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate  thus exposing primary energy to interest rate risks 
primary energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges 
the swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments 
due to the nature of the industry  credit risk is a factor in many of nisource s business activities 
in sales and trading activities  credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date 
in derivative activities  credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts  such as interest rate swaps  are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms 
exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure 
current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes  such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees 
current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments 
because many of nisource s exposures vary with changes in market prices  nisource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices 
in determining exposure  nisource considers collateral and master netting agreements  which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk 
trading risks the transactions associated with nisource s energy trading operations give rise to various risks  including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity 
the gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the nymex 
the gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities 
the power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity 
some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery  but are net settled in accordance with industry standards 
nisource employs a var model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio 
nisource estimates the one day var across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either monte carlo simulation or variance covariance at a confidence level 
based on the results of the var analysis  the daily market exposure for power trading on an average  high and low basis was million  million and effectively zero  respectively  at december  the daily var for the gas trading portfolio on an average  high and low basis was million  million and million at december   respectively 
trading contracts a summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of nisource s trading contracts during is as follows in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period including net option premiums received fair value of new contracts entered into during the period other changes in fair values during the period fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
the fair values of the contracts related to nisource s trading operations  the sources of the valuations of the contracts at december  and the years in which they mature are in millions after prices actively quoted prices from other external sources prices based on models other method total fair values contracts reported within the caption prices actively quoted include futures and options traded on the nymex 
the caption prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information 
contracts shown within prices based on models other method are valued using a black scholes option pricing model 
accounting change effective january   nisource adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
the adoption of this statement on january   resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately million 
the adoption also resulted in the recognition of million of assets and million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of million 
approximately million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of oci were reclassified into earnings during refer to summary of significant accounting policies accounting for risk management activities and risk management activities in notes and  respectively  of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of nisource s risk management

sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates  if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 
certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were million and million at december   and million and million at december   respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future  all or a portion of nisource s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 
in such event  a write down of all or a portion of nisource s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period  the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts 
if nisource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 nisource would have to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
in management s opinion  nisource s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates 
although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed  nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 
regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income  regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives 
for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks 
for fair value hedges  the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item 
for hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge 
as a result of the rate making process  the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective 
the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter  throughout the period that the hedge is designated 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 
although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges  the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high 
nisource generally uses nymex exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses 
nisource had million of price risk management assets and million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at december  the amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was million at december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc

various forms of the lessee s involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is  in substance  the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes 
generally  the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks 
if the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period  a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins 
in these synthetic lease situations  the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity

competition the regulatory environment applicable to nisource s subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes 
these changes have previously had  and will continue to have an impact on nisource s operations  structure and profitability 
at the same time  competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues 
management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment 
these initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers  providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services  acquiring companies that increase nisource s scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential  commercial and industrial customers  including the development of distributed generation technologies 
september  terrorist attacks the september  terrorist attacks that occurred on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in washington dc has had pervasive negative impacts on several us industries and on the us economy in general 
while nisource was not directly impacted by the event  the company believes that it has been impacted indirectly 
since the incident  nisource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market 
the company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously  when much of its insurance is renewed in july other indirect impacts of the september incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of nisource s industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security 
presentation of segment information as a result of the november  acquisition of columbia  nisource revised its presentation of primary business segment information 
columbia s gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of nisource 
columbia s gas distribution operations have been combined with nisource s gas distribution business 
during  nisource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure 
the realignment affected three previously reported segments  and included moving all ongoing operations of energy marketing and certain operations from the electric operations and other segments to the newly created merchant operations segment 
the electric wheeling  bulk power  and power trading operations were moved from the electric operations segment to merchant operations  and the company s primary energy subsidiary  which develops on site  industrial based energy solutions  was moved from other to merchant operations 
all periods presented reflect these changes

gas distribution operations continued competition gas distribution competes with investor owned  municipal  and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area  and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers 
gas distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas 
electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky  southern ohio  southwestern pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation 
gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets 
restructuring in december  nisource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations  customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various gas distribution and electric operations companies 
in october  nisource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions 
the current year results include million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs 
of this total  million was included in the gas distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric operations segment results 
the programs will result in a reduction of employees in field operations  contact centers  administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the nisource gas distribution and electric operations segment companies 
regulatory matters the gas industry deregulation  which began in the mid s at the federal level  has broadened to retail customers at the state level 
large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use gas distribution s facilities for transportation services for several years 
this opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in of the states 
as of december   approximately  of gas distribution s million customers have selected an alternate supplier 
gas distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions 
while these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants  gas distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future 
as customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers  the gas distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for  but no longer need 
the state commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations 
gas distribution is currently recovering  or has the opportunity to recover  the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered 
methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms  decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers 
in december  the public utilities commission of ohio puco approved a request from columbia gas of ohio  inc columbia of ohio that extends columbia of ohio s customer choice sm program through october   freezes base rates through october  and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity 
under the agreement  columbia of ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers 
columbia of ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs 
on november   the puco issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the ohio general assembly on march  the new rules establish the process for puco certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers  establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers  and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs  in which consumers have the right to opt out of the program 
the new rules are expected to become effective in mid a number of parties  including columbia of ohio  have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules 
the puco has granted a rehearing

gas distribution operations continued as part of the kentucky public service commission order approving the acquisition of columbia  columbia of kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings 
northern utilities  new hampshire division  filed a general rate case in november the filing proposes an increase in revenue of million or approximately of annual operating revenues 
on february   the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc granted an interim rate increase of approximately million 
actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case 
on august   the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for northern indiana 
under the new procedure  the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined  after hearings and iurc approval  and made effective on november of each year 
the demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the iurc 
the commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings  which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month  subject to refund 
the monthly filings do not require iurc approval but will be reviewed by the iurc during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing 
northern indiana s gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism gcim which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price 
northern indiana made its annual filing on september  ferc order the ferc issued order on february  the order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market 
it effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures  pipeline penalties  more transparent pricing  new pipeline service offerings  capacity release capabilities  new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry 
since the order was issued  pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply 
gas distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues 
to date  only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements  which have generally been approved by ferc 
the major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings  which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers 
those filings have been awaiting ferc action since early last fall 
based upon early orders from ferc on some pipelines compliance filings  gas distribution believes that implementation of order will begin to take place prior to the winter of not all of the pipelines serving gas distribution have resolved their order proceedings  however  ferc s recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of order on various aspects of pipeline operations 
gas distribution is evaluating those effects  but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry  management believes that full implementation of order no 
will not have a material effect upon gas distribution costs  operations  or income 
environmental matters remediation 
several gas distribution subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties prps at waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund and similar state laws  including at former manufactured gas plant mgp sites which such subsidiaries  or their corporate predecessors  own or previously owned or operated 
gas distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites 
in addition  some gas distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks  and under the toxic substances control act tsca for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs released at various facilities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued gas distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under superfund or similar state laws 
for one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and  for the other three  the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined 
as site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available  waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted 
a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where gas distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner 
the investigation has identified such sites 
initial investigation has been conducted at sites 
of these sites  additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at sites 
only those site investigation  characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

as costs become probable and reasonably estimable  reserves will be adjusted as appropriate 
as reserves are recorded  regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates 
nisource is unable  at this time  to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program 
management expects that  as characterization is completed  additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available  nisource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies  sfas no 
 and american institute of certified public accountants statement of position environmental remediation liabilities sop no 
as of december   a reserve of approximately million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors  including the volume of material contributed to the site  years of ownership or operation  the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required 
based upon investigations and management s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations  nisource believes that any environmental response actions required  after consideration of insurance coverage  contributions from other prps and rate recovery  will not have a material effect on its financial position 
mercury program 
until the s  gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems 
the purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home 
in  several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with nisource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury 
a number of the nisource gas distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury 
all nisource gas distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate  maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury  including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up 
to date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified 
as a result  nisource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its gas distribution subsidiaries 
market conditions the recession during contributed to lower demand 
reduced production and fuel switching to coal  oil and distillate resulted in industrial throughput falling from its peak of over bcf 
the steel industry  which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of ohio  pennsylvania and kentucky  was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued in the winter of  spot prices for gas purchases exceeded dth 
the unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period 
demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in  proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during november and december lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the winter season 
spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid dth range  prices more in line with winter seasons in the s 
entering this winter  storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn  reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity 
given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter  the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season 
the higher prices of late and early encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in by mid  this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early s 
however  with the drop in prices since last winter  that trend in drilling has turned around  with about fewer active rigs in december compared to the high experienced in july  and about fewer compared to a year ago in december all nisource gas distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs 
gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period 
the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings 
the impact of the higher gas costs on gas distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the million  or  increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in in ohio  regulatory approval was given to defer million of current year uncollectible expense  representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates 
the gas distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace 
these efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory  the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets 
the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the gas distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products 
the on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the gas distribution company system 
the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges 
the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under regulatory matters 
gas distribution generated in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in  a million increase over the prior year 
weather weather in the gas distribution service territory was warmer than normal 
this negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately million dekatherms mdth versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately million from prior year 
weather in and was and  respectively  warmer than normal 
throughput total volumes sold and transported of  mdth for increased mdth from columbia s five gas distribution companies contributed mdth additional throughput 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand  primarily the steel industry 
additionally  the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by mdth 
throughput for of mdth increased mdth from  due to the acquisition of columbia on november  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued net revenues net revenues for were  million  up million over the acquisition of columbia generated higher net revenues of million  partially offset by a decline of approximately million as a result of warmer weather 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   operating income for gas distribution operations was million  an increase of million over the same period in  reflecting the benefit of twelve months of columbia operations compared to two months in the increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately million  a million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of columbia and million for restructuring costs 
in addition  higher uncollectibles increased million over the prior year  primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the heating period 
this negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately million 
operating income of million for increased million over reflecting two months of columbia s operations and the full year effect of bay state operations 
tempering these improvements was million of expense in for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of columbia  restructuring costs and higher employee related costs

while the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state  retail choice programs are being extended to ldc customers throughout columbia transmission s market area 
among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional ldc merchant function 
in the case of columbia transmission and columbia gulf  contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with ldcs have primary terms that extend to october  management fully expects that the ldcs  or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the ldc unbundling process  will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts

capital estimates of northern indiana s nox control compliance costs range from to million over the next years 
actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand resource constraints  uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs  and the potential need for additional control technology 
in a matter related to the nox sip call  several northeastern states have filed petitions with the epa under section of the clean air act 
the petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states 
nisource is monitoring the epa s decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce nox emissions at northern indiana s electric facilities 
the epa issued final rules revising the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter in july on may   the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the epa 
the court of appeals decision was appealed to the supreme court  which heard oral arguments on november  the supreme court rendered a complex ruling on february  that will require some issues to be resolved by the dc circuit court and the epa before final rulemaking occurs 
consequently  final rules specifying a compliance level  deadline  and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future 
resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide  particulate matter and nox emissions from coal fired boilers including northern indiana s electric generating stations beyond measures discussed above 
final implementation methods will be set by the epa as well as state regulatory authorities 
nisource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the epa and are currently not reasonably estimable 
nisource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area  however  the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time 
the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act 
northern indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the epa on this subject 
it is impossible at this time to predict the result of epa s review of northern indiana s information responses 
initiatives are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  a by product of burning fossil fuels 
reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for northern indiana 
the caaa also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants 
in response to the caaa requirements  on december   the epa issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate 
the epa expects to issue proposed regulations by december   and finalized regulations by december  the potential impact  if any  to nisource s financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
electric operations continued the epa is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze 
the new administration announced that the epa would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between and to install the best available retrofit technology or bart 
the bart program will target for control by those pollutants that limit visibility  namely particulate  sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides 
until the program is developed  northern indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules 
water 
the great lakes water quality initiative gli program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the great lakes watershed  including northern indiana s three electric generating stations located on lake michigan 
the state of indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final epa approval 
as promulgated  the regulations would provide the indiana department of environmental management idem with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water 
however  the epa revised the variance language and other minor provisions of idem s gli rule 
the epa by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact  however  a separate agreement between the epa and idem on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact 
the epa change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the epa idem agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation 
northern indiana expects that idem will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations 
pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements  the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time 
remediation 
northern indiana is a prp at four waste disposal sites under cercla and similar state laws  and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites 
in addition  northern indiana has corrective action liability under rcra for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment  storage  and disposal sites 
as of december   a reserve of approximately million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors  including the volume of material contributed to the site  years of ownership of operations  the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required 
based upon investigations and management s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations  nisource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties  wells and related equipment and facilities  support equipment  and uncompleted wells 
depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis

five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers 
the energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees  sublease payments  unit sale payments or processing fees 
one project  whiting clean energy  will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use 
each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary the lessee of primary energy 
the lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity the lessor  which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction 
the lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes  secured by the lessor s rights in the facility 
the indebtedness of the lessor is not treated as indebtedness of nisource under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the lease payments from the lessee to the lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced 
with respect to three of the projects  the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on nisource s outstanding commercial paper or long term debt 
the projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases 
the responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the lessee on the remaining projects 
where the lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance  it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities 
nisource  either directly or through capital markets  has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the lessors  including regular lease payments  accelerated lease payments on an event of default  and payment obligations  including residual guarantee amounts  at the end of lease terms 
in the case of an event of default  a lessor can accelerate the full  unamortized amount of the lessor s funding 
the aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at december  was million 
at the end of an initial lease term  the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the lessor s funding 
if the lessee cannot satisfy return conditions  the lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price 
if the lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the lessee can satisfy the return conditions  the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
merchant operations continued lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount 
since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term 
one strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term 
the present value of a lessee s aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than of the amount advanced 
the following table shows  by year  future minimum rental payments  including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases 
minimum rental additional in millions payments payment total after the amounts contained in the first column  representing future minimum rental payments  are included as part of the future minimum rental payments for operating leases shown in note g in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
primary energy s whiting clean energy project at bp s whiting  indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in september the delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately million of additional funding 
primary energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay 
the project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of  at a total cost of approximately million 
in addition to the construction issues at the whiting clean energy facility  nisource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets 
for  the after tax loss is projected to be approximately million 
the profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on  among other things  prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns 
primary energy s ironside project at ltv steel company s east chicago  indiana mill has been negatively impacted by ltv s bankruptcy filing in december and ltv s december decision to idle the steel mill 
the ironside facility is complete in all material respects 
however  the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that ltv will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy  in which event the lessee will have limited contract damages against ltv and the status of an unsecured creditor 
primary energy believes that the ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices 
however  there can be no assurance that any successor to ltv will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to primary energy 
the winner of the bids for the purchase of ltv s steel mill will be determined on february  the total cost of the ironside project is approximately million 
the lease at primary energy s north lake project is due to expire in june of the several options available  the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately million 
if the lessee purchases the project  the payment will be funded by nisource 
the strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing

in september and october  management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the transcom assets 
although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network  time to market in a competitive environment  and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues  management decided to complete the transcom network and sell the completed network 
the company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays 
consequently  management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately million 
consequently  goodwill resulting from the acquisition of columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount million after tax 
in august  transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets 
based on these bids  present market conditions preclude transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time 
therefore management has decided to operate the network  while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale 
at december   the anticipated cash flow from transcom s business plan indicates that the asset s current carrying value is realizable

other affiliates 
nisource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies  including columbia propane  columbia petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies 
the primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant mgp site in wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued 
environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals 
a nisource affiliate also retains liability for two former mgp sites associated with a local gas distribution company in new york  for which reserves have been accrued 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required  other prps and their financial viability  and indemnification from previous facility owners 
only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 
and consistent with sop no 
as costs become probable and reasonably estimable  reserves will be adjusted as appropriate 
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations  for which it is ultimately liable  after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other prps  will not have a material adverse effect on nisource s financial position
