in the following discussion  all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year 
results of operations overview the company is organized into three regulated business segments  natural gas  electric and water and one non regulated business segment  propane gas 
the gas and electric segments aggregate approximately of total gross profit 
from the florida public service commission s fpsc perspective the company operates four distinct regulated entities consisting of northwest florida marianna electric  northeast florida fernandina beach electric  northeast florida fernandina beach water  and natural gas 
the company considers the northwest and northeast electric divisions one electric segment 
the company last received rate increases in the regulated entities as follows natural gas operations  may  northwest florida electric division  february  northeast florida electric division  february  and northeast florida water in may the fpsc stopped regulating the water segment of the company s business on september  due to a resolution passed by nassau county for additional information see business and regulation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s strategic initiative is to concentrate on developing deeper relationships with our customers  including builders and developers 
we are approaching them as a total energy company  not just a supplier of gas or electricity 
included in the strategy is a plan to increase the rate of future growth by concentrating on increasing customers and territories using improved marketing programs  along with a goal of acquiring small energy related companies  particularly propane companies 
during the company made two gas acquisitions  totaling less than of assets  that added approximately  customers 
definitions gross profit 
gross profit  defined as gross operating revenues less fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers  provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating our utility operations 
fuel  conservation  and unbundling costs along with taxes passed through to customers have no effect on results of operations and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of gross operating revenues between periods 
gross profit is the net revenue retained by the company for operating purposes 
summary of gross profits in thousands natural gas    propane gas    electric    water    contributing to variations in gross profit are the effects of seasonal weather conditions  the timing of rate increases  acquisitions  and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season 
operating expenses 
operating expenses exclude fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers 
these operating expenses have no effect on results of operations as they are passed on directly to customers and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of operating expenses between periods 
these costs are grouped on a separate line of the income statement as cost of fuel and taxes based on revenues 
discussion natural and propane gas service natural gas service gross profit increased  in principally due to a increase in average customers  an increase in transportation revenues of  a  increase relating to the december  asset purchase of the south florida natural gas company that was part of the atlantic utilities purchase  and new late payment fees 
the company began charging late fees in adding over  in additional gross profit 
consumption was down for the year by  excluding transportation and off system sales  primarily due to weak demand in the last quarter of the year caused by mild weather conditions and decreased tourism 
looking forward  we expect the asset purchase will add approximately another  annually to gross profit 
a gas line project for a generation facility located in palm beach county was constructed during and completed in february the total cost  with resulting increase to total assets  is anticipated to be approximately  with  expended and recorded in the company has a year agreement that will realize an return on the net invested cost of the project  which began billing in february we expect that total revenue will increase approximately  in   in  and  in  decreasing yearly as construction costs are depreciated 
because the project does not involve purchasing gas  the gross profit will increase by approximately the same amounts of the revenue 
after operating costs  interest  and income taxes  we anticipate this project to increase net income by approximately  in   in  and  in  decreasing yearly during the year agreement 
a large volume transportation customer is connecting during with an anticipated annual load of  therms

natural gas service gross profit increased  in transportation revenues accounted for  of the increase as certain customers are opting to purchase their own gas and use our system to transport the gas to their location 
the company realizes the same gross profit regardless of whether the customer purchases the gas from us or uses our system to transport the gas 
excluding the approximate customers in the central florida division that converted from propane to natural gas in  the remaining  increase in gross profit was due principally to an approximate increase in average customers as compared with consumption increased in greater proportion to the increase in customers due to winter weather colder than propane gas gross profit increased  as compared with average customers increased from to  excluding the effect of those customers who converted to natural gas

impact of recent accounting standards financial accounting standard no 
and effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the effects of applying sfas nos 
and through december  were not material to the company s financial statements and are not expected to effect future operations as the company does not expect to enter into significant derivative instruments 
financial accounting standard no 
and in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting 
sfas no 
specifies that  among other things  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill will no longer be amortized 
the standard requires goodwill to be periodically tested for impairment and written down to fair value if considered impaired 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and are effective for interim periods in the initial year of adoption 
the effects of adopting sfas nos 
and on the recent acquisitions required use of the purchase method and resulted in goodwill that will have to be tested for impairment beginning in financial accounting standard no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over its useful life 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management is in the process of evaluating the impact of implementing sfas and feels that other than changing the methodology of depreciation and increasing administrative efforts  the effect on operating results will be immaterial and feels the impact on the regulated portion of the business  if any  would be an allowable item for recovery in the company s rates 
financial accounting standard no 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement supercedes  with exceptions  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management is in the process of evaluating the impact of implementing sfas and is unable to estimate the effect  if any  on the company s financial statements but feels the regulated portion of an impact  if any  would be an allowable item for recovery in the company s rates 
other effects of inflation the company s tariffs associated with its utility operating divisions provide for fuel clauses through which rates charged to customers are adjusted for changes in the cost of fuel on a reasonably current basis 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  and the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking information that is intended to qualify for the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the effects of regulatory actions  competition  future economic conditions and weather 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in general  sfas recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by the company were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
the company has market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from reasonably possible changes in interest rates 
the company has no exposure relating to commodity prices because the company  under its regulatory jurisdictions  is fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities primarily natural gas and electricity and also passes through fluctuations in propane costs to customers 
the company has no exposure to equity risk as it does not hold any equity instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held in escrow for environmental costs  investments from restricted bond proceeds  and long term debt 
the investments held in escrow for environmental costs have gained in market value by  as of december  and mature from to we expect to hold these securities until maturity 
the restricted funds will be used during the next two years 
therefore  the company does not believe it has material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the cost of long term debt is included as a recovered cost in revenue for the regulated operations and as such the company is reimbursed for interest costs 
therefore  disclosure of the change in fair value due to reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates is not meaningful
