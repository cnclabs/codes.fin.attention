item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development the company has an ongoing program for development and commercialization of new air pollution control technologies and for enhancement of existing technologies 
during fiscal  the company refocused its spending on research and concentrated on development programs focused on the improvement of existing technologies and the identification of commercial technologies that could be readily added to its product line 
an example of the former would be work on the company s tubular  wet electrostatic precipitator and its application to the cleanup of wet flue gas desulfurization acid mist 
an example of the latter would be the ongoing development of the aod technology 
the company spent approximately  on product development in fiscal compared with  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
among other important activities  the company has developed an advanced technology for the control of sub micron sized particulate the fine particulate agglomerator  or fpa tm and has acquired both domestic and international patent protection 
the fpa is particularly suited to utility and industrial boilers as these plants are subject to increasingly stringent fine particulate emission regulations 
the fpa technology has undergone full scale commercialization and is being marketed throughout the world 
the company continues to invest in the development of this technology and in its characterization so it can be applied in a cost effective manner to the widest possible range of customers 
patents the company is the exclusive licensee in the united states of certain patented technology for a urea conversion process known as ammonia on demand or aod r 
with the approval of its licensor  eec has granted an end user sublicense for the process to american electric power 
on october   american electric power filed a declaratory judgment action in the central district of ohio against ec c technologies  inc and its licensee  hamon research cotrell  seeking a ruling that the aod process does not infringe on ec c technologies urea to ammonia patented technology 
shortly thereafter  the company joined in the lawsuit as a party plaintiff 
both ec c technologies and hamon research cotrell have filed motions to dismiss on the basis of lack of personal jurisdiction 
the company owns or has the rights to a number of other patents  patent applications  and other proprietary technologies that are important to various aspects of its business 
while many individual patents are not considered material to the conduct of the company s business as a whole  the company views its newly acquired patent protection with respect to its fine particulate agglomerator tm technology as potentially providing the company with a significant advantage in the marketing of its precipitators 
it also views the patent protection for its aod technology as potentially providing the company with a significant advantage in the marketing of systems for the control of nox emissions 
generally  however  the company believes that its ability to compete in the air pollution control industry depends primarily on its engineering and technological expertise  rather than on patent protection 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing efforts are organized to provide emphasis and focus by both geographic region and market area 
market areas include the power industry  the industrial market  and aftermarket products and services 
the company has integrated its maintenance and field service resources with a regional sales network  linked to its regional service centers  allowing it to build long term customer relationships and provide solutions to customers needs in a highly responsive manner 
the sales efforts are technical in nature and involve its sales and marketing professionals  supported by the company s senior technical and management professionals  who provide product based expertise to all regional and market areas 
the company s sales and marketing group consists of industry and regional sales managers and sales representatives 
although the company seeks to obtain repeat business from its customers  it does not depend on any single customer to maintain its level of activity from year to year 
three customers accounted for more than of the company s sales in  two customers accounted for more than of the company s sales in  and one customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in fiscal the company s relationship with american electric power through its alliance agreement resulted in all of the fiscal revenues in the aod business unit 
at fiscal year end  approximately of the company s accounts and retainages receivable were due from companies within the power industry and approximately were due from companies within the pulp and paper industry 
the company s overseas foreign sales are generated through royalties from international licensees and direct sales efforts and were of total sales in fiscal  of sales in fiscal  and less than of sales in fiscal year in order to take advantage of certain overseas market opportunities  the company has established licensing agreements with companies in the people s republic of china  india  south korea  and brazil under which the company is entitled to royalties based upon sales in the licensed territory 
these agreements do not currently represent a material source of income 
in addition to the licenses  the company was a part owner of a joint venture in china that manufactures certain precipitator components for use by the company and its licensee 
in april  the company terminated its participation in the joint venture and created a wholly owned foreign enterprise in order to gain full control over its chinese operations 
with its indian licensee  the company trained certain of the licensee s engineers to perform engineering activities for global applications  including both international projects and projects delivered in north america 
suppliers and subcontractors like other companies in its industry  the company relies on outside suppliers  manufacturers and fabricators to supply parts and components in accordance with the company s specifications 
in addition  in cases in which the company s scope of work includes installation of equipment  the company selects and supervises subcontractors for this work 
to date  the company has not experienced difficulties either in obtaining fabricated components incorporated in its systems or in obtaining qualified subcontractors 
it has been the company s recent experience  however  that in times of recession or other industry downturns  the company is more likely to be faced with subcontractor performance problems and construction claims asserted by certain of its subcontractors 
in response  the company is required to more aggressively manage its construction activities and contracts  and  in some cases  be subject to unanticipated costs 
the company s vendor sources for various components  materials and parts used in its systems  including certain electrodes  collecting plates  control switches  electrical components  and other components  include a substantial number of firms 
the company does not depend on any one of these vendors to a material extent  and in any event the company believes that alternative vendors would be available if needed 
with respect to fabricators  the company has satisfactory relationships with fabricators throughout the united states and canada 
similarly  with respect to installation subcontractors  the company has satisfactory relations with firms throughout the united states and internationally 
based on the number of vendors  fabricators  and subcontractors and the availability of alternative sources  the company does not believe that the loss of its relationship with any one firm would have a material adverse effect on its business 
competition the company faces substantial competition in each of its principal markets 
some of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company competes on the basis of price  its engineering and technological expertise and the quality of equipment and service provided 
the company believes that the cost of entry into most of its markets  its experience and reputation for reliability and service  and its knowledge of the plants and operations of its customers are principal factors that enhance its ability to provide high quality services and to compete effectively for repair and rebuild contracts as well as new installations 
additionally  the company believes that the successful performance of its installed systems is a key factor in dealing with its customers  which typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history 
many contracts for the company s systems and technologies are obtained through competitive bidding 
customers typically purchase these systems and technologies after a thorough evaluation of price  technical content  service  experience  and quality 
although price is an important factor and may in some cases be the governing factor  it is not always determinative  and contracts are often awarded on the basis of life cycle costs and or product reliability 
regulation significant environmental laws have been enacted in response to public concern about the environment 
these laws and the implementing regulations affect nearly every industrial activity 
the need to comply with these laws creates demand for the company s services 
the principal federal legislation that has created a substantial and growing demand for the company s systems and technologies  and therefore has the most significant effect on the company s business  is the clean air act of  as amended the clean air act 
this legislation requires compliance with ambient air quality standards and empowers the environmental protection agency epa to establish and enforce limits on the emission of various pollutants from specific types of facilities 
the states have primary responsibility for implementing these standards and  in some cases  have adopted standards more stringent than those established by the epa 
in  amendments to the clean air act were adopted which address  among other things  the country s acid rain problem by imposing strict controls on the emissions of sulfur oxides caused by the combustion of coal and other solid fuels 
the power generation market is the first to face the compliance standards set by the amendments 
under the legislation  coal burning power plants are required to comply with new emissions standards in two phases 
the first phase  beginning with enactment of the amendments and generally ending in or  required reduced emissions levels leading to full compliance  with limited exceptions  by the end of the second phase in the year during  the epa approved regulations that are expected to significantly increase the number of companies subject to regulation for ozone related emissions  and for emissions of particles at a much smaller size than previously regulated 
during  the epa issued regulations requiring utilities in states to significantly reduce nox emissions by the year  in order to control smog creation 
in its operations  the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning environmental  safety  occupational and health standards 
expenditures required by such laws were not material to the company s business and the company is not at a competitive disadvantage by reason of compliance with such laws 
market risks as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in these foreign currencies if this exposure becomes material but does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of march  the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies was not material 
therefore an increase or decrease of percent in the foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
bonding and insurance the company is from time to time required to provide bonds guaranteeing that it will enter into contracts as bid  guaranteeing performance of its contract obligations  and or guaranteeing prompt payment of its suppliers and subcontractors 
the terrorist attacks of september  along with the financial collapse and subsequent default by some major corporations in the united states have dramatically changed the overall bonding market and have somewhat hampered the company s ability to secure bonds 
however  the company has been able to enter into surety arrangements during fiscal and expects that its current surety arrangements are sufficient to support the company s expected levels of bonded business 
in addition  the company has a bank revolving credit and letter of credit agreement that provides for issuance of letters of credit for various purposes  including as substitutes for performance or payment bonds 
the company currently maintains different types of insurance  including comprehensive liability  property and errors and omissions coverage 
while a successful claim in an amount in excess of the company s insurance coverage  or for which there is no coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company  the company believes that it presently maintains adequate insurance coverage for its business 
employees as of march   the company had full time employees  of whom more than were engineers and other professionals and technical employees 
the company also hires contract and other temporary personnel to meet the requirements of particular contracts  as well as contract personnel to carry out maintenance activities and construction supervisory functions 
the company s professional staff includes chemical engineers  electrical engineers  mechanical engineers  civil engineers  and computer scientists 
although the company depends on professional employees for performance of its services  it has not experienced any difficulty in employing such personnel to satisfy its requirements 
none of the company s employees is represented by a union 
the company considers its relations with its employees to be good 
american stock exchange the company s stock is listed and traded on the american stock exchange amex 
in order to continue to be listed on the amex  a company must be compliant with all of the listing requirements of the exchange 
during fiscal  the company received notice from amex that is was below certain of the exchange s listing standards 
specifically  the company had losses from continuing operations in two of its three most recent fiscal years and did not have shareholders equity of at least  as such  the company has had several discussions with exchange personnel and has submitted a plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of amex 
the company expects to comply with the listing standards by the end of fiscal year since its operations in fiscal resulted in income from continuing operations and the company fully expects that fiscal will show continued profitability 
the company has not received  and does not expect to receive  a notice from the amex to de list its stock from the exchange 
item properties substantially all of the company s operations  including administration  engineering  design  and sales operations are conducted from its baltimore headquarters  located in a modern office building with approximately  square feet of leased space 
the company occupies approximately  square feet of this space and subleases substantially all of the remaining space
