item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  it should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto and other financial and operating information included in this form k 
overview the company offers products and services to patients  providers  payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the fertility industry 
the integramed network is comprised of thirteen fertility centers in major markets across the united states  a pharmaceutical subsidiary  a financing subsidiary  the council of physicians and scientists  a research institute and a leading fertility portal www 
integramed 
com 
eight fertility centers have access to the company s fertilitydirect program 
five of the fertility centers are designated as reproductive science centers r and as such  have access to the company s fertilitydirect program in addition to being provided with a full range of services including i administrative services  including accounting and finance  human resource functions  and purchasing of supplies and equipment  ii access to capital and servicing and financing patient accounts receivable  iii marketing and sales  iv integrated information systems  and v assistance in identifying best clinical practices collectively  business services 
the company s strategy is to align information  technology and finance for the benefit of fertility patients  providers  payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the primary elements of the company s strategy include i selling additional fertilitydirect contracts to leading fertility centers in major markets  ii selling shared risk refund treatment packages to patients of contracted fertility centers and managing the risk associated with the programs  iii selling additional reproductive science center business service contracts  iv increasing revenues at reproductive science centers  v increasing sales of pharmaceutical products and services  vi expanding clinical research opportunities  and vii establishing internet based access to patient specific information on treatment process and outcomes 
in september  the company obtained from fleet bank  na a million credit facility to fund acquisitions to provide working capital and to refinance its existing bank debt 
in september  the company elected not to renew credit facilities related to potential acquisitions  as management believes that internal sources of funds will be sufficient to finance any future acquisitions 
the company renewed the working capital and term loan components of this facility  which totaled approximately million 
during  the company accelerated amortization of the right to manage fees for the kansas city and dallas reproductive science centers 
in december  the company s agreement with the medical center based reproductive science center was terminated early 
the company received million in liquidated damages pursuant to an early termination agreement 
these funds were recorded as revenue by the company during as compensation for certain performance obligations contained in the termination agreement 
during the company negotiated revised fee structures on all five of its major reproductive science center business services contracts 
on four of these contracts in which service fees are comprised of a a fixed percentage of revenue  b a fixed percentage of medical practice earnings and c reimbursed cost of services  the company negotiated lower fixed percentages on the revenue and medical practice earnings components 
these lower fees are to be phased in over an approximately five year period 
the company believes that this revised fee structure will be more than offset by growth in the underlying medical practices  and will in turn result in growth in the company s aggregate revenues 
on the remaining reproductive science center contract  the company negotiated higher service fees  which are assessed at a fixed amount each month independent of the medical practice s underlying revenue or earnings 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
the company principally derives its revenues from business services contracts and the sale of pharmaceutical products 
the company does not have a controlling financial interest in any of the fertility centers  including the reproductive science centers  and as such does not consolidate their results 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue and cost recognition reproductive science center service fees as of december   the company provided comprehensive business services to medical practices under five business services contracts 
under four of the current agreements  the company receives as compensation for its business services a three part fee comprised of i a percentage of net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a medical practice and any costs paid on behalf of the medical practice and iii a fixed or variable percentage of earnings after business services fees or an additional variable percentage of net revenues 
under the fifth current agreement  as compensation for its services  the company receives a fixed fee plus reimbursed costs of services 
all revenues from reproductive science center service fees are recorded in the period services are rendered

pharmaceutical sales the company distributes fertility related pharmaceutical products through integramed pharmaceutical services  inc ipsi  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the company has a servicing arrangement with ivpcare to fulfill the purchase and distribution of pharmaceuticals
