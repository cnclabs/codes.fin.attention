summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize software revenue in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sop provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized for licensing  selling  leasing or otherwise marketing computer software 
we recognize revenues from sales of software as completed products are shipped and title passes and from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  assuming that collection is reasonably assured 
we generally accept returns for defective and damaged products and we may also permit customers to return or exchange product or we may provide price protection on products unsold by a customer 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns  exchanges  markdowns  price concessions  and warranty costs 
such reserves are based upon our management s evaluation of historical experience  current industry trends and estimated costs 
while returns and other concessions have historically been within our estimates except as disclosed in the immediately succeeding sentence  the amount of estimated reserves could change as new information becomes available 
during the year ended december   our largest distributor changed its order taking and stocking policies 
as a result  we agreed  in the second quarter of  to accept a significantly higher level of product returns than was anticipated in an effort to work with the distributor to reduce their inventory 
we believe that these returns represented a one time event related to a policy change of our largest distributor that will not significantly impact the historical and ongoing return rates from the distributor 
if this is not an isolated occurence future unexpected returns could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize consulting services and hosting revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
we often offer point of sale incentives such as coupons or rebates 
the cost of such incentives has historically been included as selling and marketing expense 
effective january   we are required to adopt emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
pursuant to the consensus of issue  the cost of sales incentives we offer without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is required to be accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
upon application of the consensus  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes will be reclassified to comply with the 
table of contents revised income statement display requirements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of these issues  as we have not historically tracked all of the above costs separately from other selling and marketing expenses 
however  we estimate the approximate cost of sales incentives that will be reclassified  reducing both revenue and expense by the same amount  is approximately to of total revenue based upon estimates 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and those losses have historically been within our expectations 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for product returns and price protection are included in other adjustments to accounts receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances that indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of long lived assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred and have determined that there was no impairment at december  in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while we have not experienced impairment of intangible assets in prior periods  we cannot guarantee that there will not be impairment in the future  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues software consulting services total net revenues cost of revenues software consulting services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss 
table of contents years ended december    and revenues total net revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and an increase of million or  from to ingram micro  our largest distribution customer  accounted for  and of total net revenues for  and respectively 
software 
net software revenues were million  million  and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or from to and an increase of  or  from to software revenues accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and materially all revenues in the decrease in net software revenues from to was primarily the result of declining legacy oem fax product revenues and a substantial and unexpected change in order taking and stocking policies by our largest distributor in the second quarter of during that quarter  the distributor announced that its future inventories will run at approximately of previous levels 
as a result of this policy shift  new purchases from the distributor were unusually low during the second quarter of additionally  in june  we agreed to accept a significantly higher level of product returns than we had anticipated  totaling approximately million  in an effort to work with the distributor to reduce their inventory 
this one time return resulted in a corresponding decrease in retail software sales during the second quarter of the increase in net software revenue from to was due  in part  from additional retail sales provided by the touchstone acquisition  which took place in july  and from sales of our new quick link mobile software to cellular phone manufacturers 
overall  net software revenues from through indicate a declining trend 
we operate with little backlog because we generally ship our software products as we receive orders and because our royalty revenue is based upon our customers actual usage in a given period 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders that we book and ship in that quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to predict future revenues and trends 
consulting services 
consulting services revenues were million in  million in and were not significant in we developed our consulting business in connection with the acquisition of pcs in september  which we expanded upon in early  and again in september with the quickstart acquisition 
consulting services revenue accounted for of total revenues in and of total revenues in during the impact of a full year of quickstart operations was offset by the continuing economic downturn and its impact on declining it budgets 
cost of revenues cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or from to with no change from to the decrease in the cost of software revenue is directly related to the decrease in software revenue during the period 
the cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
cost of consulting service revenues 
cost of consulting service revenues was million and million in and  respectively 
since we did not begin consulting services until september  cost of consulting service revenues was not significant in cost of consulting services revenues includes the cost of our consulting personnel and the cost of hiring outside contractors to support our staff of consultants 
the increase in the cost of consulting service revenues was due to the impact of a full year of quickstart operations in cost of consulting services revenues as a percentage of consulting services revenues was in and in the increase in cost of consulting service revenues as a percentage of revenues was due to higher personnel costs and lower utilization of such personnel due to lower than expected revenues 

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to and a decrease of  or  from to our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
the increase in our selling and marketing expenses from to was primarily the result of increases in our ecommerce segment  including salaries and related personnel expenses 
both of these increases came as a result of the additional expense of the quickstart acquisition and the overall increase in the size of our internet solutions division 
these costs were partially offset by cost reduction measures undertaken in the second quarter of the decrease in our selling and marketing expenses in over was primarily the result of an approximate million reduction in spending for costs related to advertising and trade shows 
these savings were partially offset by increases in hiring related spending increases in our ecommerce segment  including salaries and related personnel expenses and facilities expenses  which totaled approximately  research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to and an increase of  or  from to our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our wireless  diagnostic  utility and internet software technologies 
the decrease in our research and development expenses from to is primarily due to the cost reduction efforts implemented in  most notably a reduction in headcount and the closure of our oregon and colorado offices in the second quarter of this reduction realigns our research and development cost base consistent with current revenues 
the increase in our research and development expenses in over was primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses of approximately  which was offset by reductions in purchased technologies of approximately  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to and an increase of  or  from to the decrease in our general and administrative expenses in from is due primarily to cost reduction efforts undertaken in  which consisted of reductions in headcount  compensation and professional services 
the increase in our general and administrative expenses in over resulted when reductions in salaries and related expenses of approximately  were offset by increases in consulting fees for investor relations of approximately  bad debt expense of approximately  primarily related to our ecommerce business and increased amortization expense of approximately  related to the acquisition of quickstart in september restructuring costs 
in the second quarter of we began implementing a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities and reduce personnel costs 
the plan was fully implemented by december  total expense related to the restructuring amounted to  consisting of facility closure costs of  and employee severance costs of  these reductions were made to correlate with revised revenue forecasts 
as of december    had been paid and  was included in accrued liabilities 
the accrued liability will be paid over the remaining lease term for the facility closed in the second quarter of interest income  net 
net interest income was   and  in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and a decrease of  or  from to decreases in our interest income  in each of years being reported  are directly related to the reductions in our cash balance and declining interest rates 
we have not changed our investment strategy during the periods being reported on  with our excess cash consistently being invested in short term marketable securities 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion elsewhere in this annual report 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was   and  in  
table of contents and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in and is primarily due to taxes on foreign income  which may vary significantly from year to year 
we completed a tax audit during the first quarter of  which resulted in a payment of  the payment was offset by foreign tax credits in the amount of  the provision for income taxes in is due to the increase in our valuation allowance to offset all deferred tax assets 
this increase was taken because our results of operations provided insufficient evidence that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we may reduce our valuation allowance in the future at such time when there is sufficient evidence that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from net proceeds of million generated by our initial public offering in our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash used in operations was million in compared to million in and million in the primary use of cash in each year was our net loss 
we used  in   in and million in for investing activities 
our primary use of cash for investing activities in all years related to our acquisitions  including our acquisition of stf technologies in for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we also invested in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment  during each of  and in   was generated from financing activities  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
this compared to  in  which was offset by the repayment of a loan assumed in the acquisition of stf 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent periods 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we have non cancelable operating leases for our building facilities which expire on various dates through july  future minimum rental commitments under leases with terms of year or more consist of the following in thousands year ending december recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires us to measure all derivatives at fair value and to recognize them in the balance sheet as an asset or liability  depending on our rights or obligations under the 
table of contents applicable derivative contract 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which deferred the effective date of adoption of sfas no 
for one year 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  adoption of the new method of accounting for derivatives and hedging activities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position because we do not have derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued two new pronouncements sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  there are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before july   that were accounted for by the purchase method 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
in accordance with these pronouncements  we will evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the initial impact of adopting sfas no 
we expect the ongoing impact of this adoption will be a decrease in amortization expense of approximately  in in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in the emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product 
effective january   we are required to adopt eitf pursuant to the consensus of issue  the cost of sales incentives we offer without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is required to be accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
upon application of the consensus  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes will be reclassified to comply with the revised income statement display requirements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of these issues  as we have not historically tracked all of the above costs separately from other selling and marketing expenses 
however  we estimate the approximate cost of sales incentives that will be reclassified  reducing both revenue and expense by the same amount  is approximately to of total revenue based upon estimates 
risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  they could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do 
table of contents not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers  including our largest distributor  the size and timing of any return product requests for our products  our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  general economic and market conditions  variations in the our sales channels or the mix of our product sales  the gain or loss of a key customer  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  the effect of new and emerging technologies  deferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements or operating systems  customer policy and or procedural changes regarding stocking  and the success of our cost cutting measures 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  depreciation  amortization  and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
if we are unable to comply with nasdaq s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
in the second half of our common stock failed to meet the minimum bid price of per share for consecutive days  which caused our stock price to fail to meet one of the minimum standards required by nasdaq for continued listing as a nasdaq national market security 
on september   the nasdaq stock market  inc announced that it was implementing an across the board moratorium on the minimum bid requirements for continued listing on nasdaq until january  on january   the nasdaq discontinued the moratorium on the minimum bid price requirements for continued listing 
if our stock cannot maintain trading at prices over we may become subject to the delisting process 
nasdaq also currently requires that an issuer have either net tangible assets of at least million or shareholders equity of at least million to maintain listing on the national market system 
as of december   we had tangible net assets of million and shareholders equity of million 
we are currently subject to certain grandfather provisions that allow us to maintain our listing based on the net tangible assets test 
this transitional rule will remain in effect until november   at which time we will be required to comply with the million shareholders equity test 
if we are unable to increase shareholders equity to the minimum nasdaq requirement by generating profits or by an infusion of additional capital  we will not meet the minimum listing requirements of the nasdaq national market as of november there can be no assurance that we will satisfy all requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to meet the continued listing requirements in the future  our common stock will be subject to delisting  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity currently available to our stockholders 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our market  which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our revenues 

table of contents our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands  keep up with evolving industry standards  including changes in the microsoft operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible  and to promote those products successfully 
the communications and utilities software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers 
if our software markets do not develop as we anticipate or our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future operating systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors which could negatively affect our revenues 
we operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology 
microsoft corporation poses a significant competitive threat to us because microsoft operating systems  windows xp  windows me  windows  windows  windows and windows nt  may include some capabilities now provided by certain of our oem and retail software products 
if users are satisfied relying on the capabilities of windows xp  windows me  windows  windows  windows  windows nt or other operating systems  sales of our products are likely to decline 
in addition  our principal fax related retail products  hotfax messagecenter and hotfax  currently compete directly with symantec s winfax pro 
in addition  because there are low barriers to entry into the software market  we expect significant competition from other established and emerging software companies in the future 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential oem customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products 
microsoft corporation and many of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
there is also a substantial risk that announcements of competing products by large competitors such as microsoft and symantec could result in the cancellation of orders by retailers  distributors or other customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products 
in addition  some of our competitors  such as symantec  currently make complementary products that are sold separately 
such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated  cost effective software applications 
some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer oem products with a reduced set of features 
the opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make oem products available at their own cost or even at a loss 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations  which may lead to the creation of additional large and well financed competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
we rely primarily on one distributor for a significant portion of our total revenues 
sales to ingram micro  a retail distributor  represented  and of our total net revenues in  and  respectively 
we are not able to directly control all the factors influencing whether and in what quantity ingram purchases products from us 
the significant curtailment of purchases and increase in product returns by ingram micro  as experienced by us in the second quarter of  had an adverse effect on our business in that quarter and in there can be no assurance that sales to ingram micro  other distributors or our retail customers in the future will not be negatively impacted by returns 
there can also be no assurance that we will not lose ingram micro as a distributor of our products altogether 
we have entered into an agreement with another distributor in an attempt to reduce our reliance upon ingram micro 

table of contents we may not be able to develop and maintain relationships with distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products 
we depend on distributors such as ingram micro  retailers such as staples  compusa  office depot  etc  ecommerce distributors and value added resellers  commonly known as vars  to market and distribute our retail software products 
our relationships with our distributors and retailers depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to meet certain minimum sales volume requirements 
in addition  with little or no advanced notice to us our retailers and vars may purchase fewer products from us in any given quarter for reasons beyond our control and in many cases unrelated to end user demand  such as a decision to change their inventory strategies 
our agreements with retailers and vars are not exclusive and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause 
if this happens or if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products  our retail sales will be adversely affected 
we may have excessive  unanticipated retail product returns  which could negatively affect our revenues 
we are exposed to the risk of product returns  markdown allowances and stock rotations with respect to sales of our retail products 
we generally accept returns for defective and damaged products and may provide price protection on products unsold by a customer 
in addition  we may provide markdown allowances  which consist of credits given to customers to induce them to increase sales to consumers and to help manage our customers inventory levels in the distribution channel 
we may also allow distributors to rotate stock  where they may substitute one product for another 
although we maintain a reserve for these situations  and manage these allowances through our returns authorization procedure  we could choose to accept substantial allowances to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels 
during the second quarter of  we agreed to accept a significantly higher level of product returns than we had anticipated in an effort to work with a distributor to reduce their inventory 
we expect ongoing distribution inventories at our largest distributor to run approximately of previous levels 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our current operations to suffer 
we have in the past made and we expect to continue to consider acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make any additional acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from our company s day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition 
we may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition related accounting costs and write offs 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies within existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  
table of contents market conditions within our retail and oem software markets  general global economic and political instability  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our products may contain undetected software errors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected errors 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these errors 
although we and our oem customers test our products  it is possible that errors may be found in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products 
these undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance of our products or claims against us by customers 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing to fund our activities 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish right to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we currently have no established line of credit or other business borrowing facility in place 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents marketing efforts for our retail software products require substantial investments that may adversely affect our operating margins 
maintaining product recognition distribution channels for our retail software products  including our new checkit line of products  requires significant investments in marketing and sales related to these products 
we expect to have to continue to incur these costs and perhaps even to increase them in the future 
accordingly  our retail sales may not provide us with the same contribution margin to operating income that we have historically achieved on our oem sales 
inability or delays in deliveries from our component suppliers could damage our reputation and could cause our net revenues to decline and harm our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with the components for our product kits 
these components include cds and printed manuals 
we also rely on third parties for cd rom replication 
we do not have long term supply arrangements with any vendor to obtain these necessary components for our products 
if we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers or if the cd rom replication facilities that we use do not deliver our requirements on schedule  we may not be able to deliver products in a cd rom format to our customers on a timely basis or enter into new orders because of a shortage in components 
any delays that we experience in delivering our products to customers could impair our customer relationships and adversely impact our reputation and our business 
in addition  if our third party suppliers raise their prices for components or cd rom replication services  our gross margins would be reduced 
because we currently operate with little or no backlog  our ability to project our revenues is extremely limited 
we operate with little backlog because we generally ship our software products as we receive orders and because our royalty revenue is based upon our customers actual usage in a given period 
accordingly  we recognize revenue shortly after orders are received or royalty reports are generated 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders that we book and ship in that quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to predict what our revenues and operating results will be in any quarter 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
our success is dependent upon our software code base  our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright and trademark law 
however  these measures afford us only limited protection 
we currently own united states trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks  but we have not yet obtained registrations for all of our trademarks in the united states or other countries 
in addition  prior to becoming a publicly held entity  we did not require our employees to sign proprietary information and inventions agreements stipulating to our software ownership rights 
we only recently started the patent application process for a number of technologies relating to our existing products and products under development 
furthermore  we rely primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
accordingly  despite the precautions we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks  patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features  content  or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties 
we have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our fax products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products 
infringement claims  whether with or without merit  
table of contents could result in time consuming and costly litigation  divert the attention of our management  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products 
we must continue to retain key personnel 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical and consulting personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of our key employees would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our communication software products as well those in our highly specialized consulting business 
competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry 
our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development  consulting services  marketing  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue  develop new products or product enhancements and generally have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  retaining key employees during restructuring efforts is critical to company success 
if commerce conducted over the internet grows more slowly than in the past  our future sales and future profits may decline 
if ecommerce does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than in the past  demand for certain of our products and services will be reduced 
certain of our products  including webcatalog  enhance companies abilities to transact business nd conduct web based operations 
as a result  future sales and any future profits from those products are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by consumers and businesses 
to be successful we must rely on consumers and businesses who have not historically used the internet to transact business and exchange information 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in the future  we may expand these international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including general political  social and economic conditions causing instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 

table of contents our officers and directors could control matters submitted to our stockholders 
as of march   william w 
smith jr  the president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of our company  and rhonda l 
smith  the secretary  treasurer and vice chairman of the board of our company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
william w 
smith jr 
and rhonda l 
smith are married to one another and  acting together  will have the ability to elect our directors and determine the outcome of any corporate action requiring stockholder approval  including a sale of the company  irrespective of how other shareholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to buy our company  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock could cause the price of our shares to decline 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
of this amount  the  shares held by william w 
smith  jr 
and rhonda l 
smith are available for sale in the public market subject to the volume and other applicable restrictions of rule 
overall  our trading volume fluctuates widely and at times is relatively limited 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by william w 
smith  jr  rhonda l 
smith or any other person  including through any directed selling plan  either individually or when aggregated with sales by other persons  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could make a takeover of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for instance  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of shares of any series of preferred stock  without action by our stockholders 
as a result  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  which could delay or prevent a change of control because the rights given to the holders of such preferred stock may prohibit a merger  reorganization  sale or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
