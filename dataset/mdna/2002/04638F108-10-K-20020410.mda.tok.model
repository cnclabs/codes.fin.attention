other the company has a contingent obligation relating to the telefactor acquisition that requires the company to pay additional consideration to the sellers if certain sales amounts are achieved during the seventy two months following the closing of the transaction

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments as follows revenue recognition the majority of the company s product sales are recorded at the time of shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any installation obligations 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligation are fulfilled 
warranty claims and bad debts provisions for the estimated costs for future product warranty claims and bad debts are recorded in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expense  respectively  at the time a sale is recorded 
the amounts recorded are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis such as new product introduction for warranty and bankruptcies of particular customers for bad debts 
the company also periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves for warranty and bad debts recorded in its consolidated balance sheet as a further test to ensure the adequacy of the recorded provisions 
warranty claims can extend far into the future and bad debt analysis often involves subjective analysis of a particular customer s ability to pay 
as a result  significant judgment is required by the company in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
the company believes that its procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual amounts 
customer returns customer returns are recorded on an actual basis throughout the year and also include an estimate at the end of each reporting period for future customer returns related to sales recorded prior to the end of the period 
the company generally estimates customer returns based upon its historical experience while making adjustments for any changes in business conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company records provisions to write down obsolete and excess inventory at its estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory consists of the company analyzing the inventory supply on hand and estimating the net realizable value of the inventory based on historical experience  current business conditions and anticipated future sales 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this sfas requires that deferred income taxes be determined based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
the company has historically had prepaid income tax assets due principally to the unfavorable tax consequences of recording expenses for required book reserves for such things as  bad debts  inventory valuation  and warranty that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are actually paid 
the company s deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of favorable tax consequences associated with accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes 
the company believes that the amounts recorded as prepaid income tax assets will be recoverable either through future taxable income generated by the company or by the fact that the company has deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset the amount of the prepaid income tax assets  however  there can be no absolute assurance that all recognized prepaid income tax assets will be fully recovered 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings or cashflow or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company performs the impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

subsequent to january   the company will account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no  business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these new pronouncements will require considerable judgment 
the company has not yet determined the impact if any of the adoption of these new accounting standards
