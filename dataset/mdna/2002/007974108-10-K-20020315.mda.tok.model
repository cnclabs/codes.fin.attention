item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report to stockholders 
risk factors our operating results fluctuate significantly and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rates 
licenses into multi user networked environments have increased both in individual size and number  and the timing and size of individual license transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
we may not be successful in closing large license transactions such as these on a timely basis or at all 
accordingly  because revenues from large licenses are increasing as a portion of our net revenues  the timing of such licenses could cause additional variability in our quarterly operating results 
software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved by us on products and services  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely affect our operating results 
we have generally realized lower revenues from license fees in the first quarter of the year than in the last quarter of the prior year 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the concentration by some clients of larger capital purchases in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and their lower purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter 
we believe our annual incentive compensation plans  which tend to produce increased year end sales activity  compound this factor 
furthermore  we have often recognized a substantial portion of each quarter s license revenues in the last month  weeks or even days of that quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in revenue or earnings may not be evident until late in or after the close of a particular quarter and a disruption late in the quarter may have a disproportionately large negative impact on our quarterly results 
because of the above factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in november like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly during times of high market volatility 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  our stock price is likely to decline 
in addition  our stock price may be affected by trends in the financial service sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
our sales cycle is long and we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
because the purchase of our software products often requires significant  executive level investment and systems architecture decisions by prospective customers  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales effort 
these transactions may be delayed during the customer decision process because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefit of our products 
as a result  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our software products is typically between two and twelve months depending upon the size of the client  though it can be considerably longer  and is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgeting constraints and internal selection procedures  among other factors 
as a result of a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
the timing of large individual sales is especially difficult to forecast 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  customers may postpone their purchases of our existing products or product enhancements in advance of the anticipated introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 
because our expenses are generally relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we depend heavily on our product  axys 
in   and  we derived a majority of our net revenues from the licensing of axys  part of our advent office suite  and related applications and services 
in addition  many of our other applications  such as moxy  qube and various data interfaces were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  we believe that a majority of our net revenues  for the foreseeable future  will depend upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
we depend upon financial markets 
the target clients for our products include a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios  including investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks and hedge funds 
in addition  we target corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations  which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
we believe that demand for our products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
in addition  a slowdown in formation of new investment firms or a decline in the growth of assets under management would cause a decline in demand for our products 
any resulting decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
difficulties in integrating our acquisitions could adversely impact our business and we face risks associated with potential acquisitions  investments or divestitures 
in we completed acquisitions of rex development partners  lp  npo solutions  inc  managerlink 
com and our scandinavian distributors located in norway  sweden and denmark and signed a definitive agreement to acquire kinexus corporation  which acquisition was completed in february our acquisition of kinexus corporation is our largest acquisition to date  and the number of acquisitions completed in is unprecedented for us 
the complex process of integrating kinexus and our other acquisitions has required and will continue to require significant resources  particularly in light of our relative inexperience integrating acquisitions 
integrating these acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
this integration process has strained our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  and has resulted in the diversion of management and financial resources from our core business objectives 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of these entities could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant challenges o expected synergy benefits from these acquisitions  such as lower costs  may not be realized or may be realized more slowly than anticipated  particularly with regard to costs associated with a reduction in headcount and facilities  o potentially incompatible cultural differences between the companies  o incorporating these companies technologies and products into our current and future product lines  o geographic dispersion of operations and the complexities of international operations  o integrating the technical teams of these companies with our engineering organizations  o generating market demand for an expanded product line  o integrating the products of these companies with our business  because we do not have distribution  manufacturing  marketing or support experience for these products  o the difficulty of leveraging our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and o our inability to retain previous customers or employees of these entities 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and commit significant management time integrating the operations  technology  development programs  products  information systems  customers and personnel of these acquisitions 
these costs have been and will likely continue to be substantial and include costs for o integrating and reorganizing operations  including combining teams  facilities and processes in various functional areas  o identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities  developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing those plans  o fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing the integration process  o settling existing liabilities of these companies  o uncovering through our audit process new issues reflected on the companies financial statements  o costs associated with vacating  subleasing and closing facilities  o employee relocation  redeployment or severance costs  o integrating technology and products  and o other transaction costs associated with the acquisition  including financial advisor  attorney  accountant and exchange agent fees 
we may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies in the future which would further exacerbate these issues 
in addition  we continually evaluate the performance of all our products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or product lines 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition or divestiture could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt  write off investments  infrastructure costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  write off impaired goodwill or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders ownership 
finally  we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues 
we believe that the market for large management software systems may be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including reductions in capital expenditures by large customers  poor performance of major financial markets  and increasing competition 
those factors may  in turn  give rise to a number of market trends that may slow revenue growth across the industry  including longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software and related services  and increased price competition 
if the current economic slowdown continues  the presence of these factors in the market for large management software systems could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are exposed to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  and other events beyond our control 
additionally  we are vulnerable to interruption caused by political and terrorist incidents 
our facilities in new york were temporarily closed due to the september  terrorist attacks 
immediately after the terrorist attacks  our clients who were located in the world trade center area were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional software components  while the grounding of transportation impeded our ability to deliver professional services at client sites 
additionally  during the temporary closure of the us stock markets  our clients did not use our market data services 
such interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business and could seriously harm us 
further  such attacks could cause instability in the financial markets upon which we depend 
we are continuing to expand our internet based products 
to take advantage of the internet  we are continuing to develop services to bring internet based products and services to clients 
as we develop these new products and services  we have entered  and will continue to enter  into development agreements with information providers  clients or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services 
we may not be successful in marketing our internet services or in developing other internet services 
additionally  we may not be successful in being able to replace our current technology with new technology 
our failure to do so could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we cannot assure you that there will not be disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party vendors 
any such disruptions could harm our business 
security risks and concerns may deter the use of the internet for conducting business 
a significant barrier to commerce and communications over public networks is the secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary information 
if any well publicized compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the internet for commerce and communications 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or other third parties  which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
to the extent that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business would be harmed if we do not prevent them 
we face risks related to our new business areas 
we have expanded in recent periods into a number of new business areas to foster long term growth including international operations  strategic alliances  and advent trustednetwork 
these areas are still relatively new to our product development and sales personnel 
new business areas require significant management time and resources prior to generating significant revenues and may divert management from our core business 
there is no assurance that we will compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these areas 
the success of our ability to develop and market new internet based products and services  in particular  is difficult to predict because it represents a new area of business for our entire industry 
additionally  to help manage our growth  we will need to continually improve our operational  financial  management and information systems and controls 
we expect our gross and operating margins may fluctuate over time 
we expect that our gross and operating margins may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to introduce new products  expand our professional services organization and associated revenue  continue to hire additional personnel and increase other expenses to support our business 
we plan our expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels 
because these expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  a fluctuation in revenue could lead to operating results differing from expectations 
we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices 
we may not be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  or at all  and our new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including certain system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  database vendors and development tool vendors 
if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws  or if such products are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  our business could be seriously harmed 
software products as complex as those offered by us may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although we have not experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors  we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us and our clients  defects or errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our business 
if our relationship with interactive data is terminated  our business may be harmed 
many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from interactive data 
interactive data pays us a commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients 
our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason 
termination of our agreement with interactive data would require at least two years notice by either us or them  or days in the case of material breach 
if our relationship with interactive data were terminated or their services were unavailable to our clients for any reason  replacing these services could be costly and time consuming 
we face intense competition 
the market for investment management software is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
our competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of timeshare services 
our competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
in addition  we compete indirectly with existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors like us 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  we also face competition from potential new entrants into our market who may develop innovative technologies or business models 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we face challenges in expanding our international operations 
we market and sell our products in the united states and  to a lesser extent  internationally 
in november  we established a subsidiary located in australia  advent australia pty 
ltd  to market and license our products in australia 
in addition  we entered into a distributor relationship in with advent europe  an independent distributor of our products in selected european markets 
in november  we acquired the norwegian  swedish  and danish companies of this independent distributor 
in order to further expand our international operations  we will need to continue to establish additional facilities  acquire other businesses or enter into additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our establishment of facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including o the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  o greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language  regulatory and technology standards of other countries  o difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o political and economic instability 
the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local currencies 
we have not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential foreign currency exposure 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect revenues from international sales and the us dollar value of our foreign subsidiaries revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
our international revenues from our distributors are generally denominated in us dollars 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products that could seriously harm our business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or a delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could seriously harm our business 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers and customers 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite these efforts  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
we do not have any patents  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  we cannot be certain that others will not develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology  or that equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products  thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent  if issued  would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this litigation may be time consuming and expensive 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we must retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management and key technical personnel  none of who has an employment agreement with us 
additionally  our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  backgrounds and industry experience 
competition for qualified engineers  particularly in northern california and the san francisco bay area  is intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
much of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  since the formation of our subsidiaries in australia and scandinavia  whose revenues  expenses and capital spending are transacted in local currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
results of operations from our international subsidiaries are not material to our operating results  therefore  we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
however  immediate sharp increases in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  immediate sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
the table below presents principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
estimated fair value at december  total federal instruments     weighted average interest rate commercial paper short term obligations   weighted average interest rate corporate notes bonds     weighted average interest rate municipal notes bonds     weighted average interest rate total portfolio  excluding equity securities     at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately million  which is comprised of the million in our investment portfolio presented above and an additional million in cash and cash equivalents
