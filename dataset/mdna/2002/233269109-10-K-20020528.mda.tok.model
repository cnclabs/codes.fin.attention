item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statement of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be required to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition dpac recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer certain of our customers the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
while such returns have historically been insignificant and within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balances outstanding 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
goodwill we record goodwill arising from acquisitions as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and have been amortizing goodwill over a useful life of seven years 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be evaluated at least annually for future impairment and written down when the recorded value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the company adopted the provision of the statement on march  as a result  the company has ceased amortization of goodwill  reducing annual amortization expense by approximately  in addition  future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset due to uncertainty regarding the future realization based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we continue to weigh evidence throughout each year to assess the reasonableness of the valuation allowance 
if we determine that a full valuation allowance is no longer appropriate we would be required to decrease the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  which would result in a one time favorable impact on net income and then result in a normal effective tax rate in the future which could affect our net income 
results of operations the following table summarized dpac s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the three fiscal years ended february  as a percentage of net sales fiscal years ended february  net sales total cost of sales gross profit costs and expenses selling  general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year net sales of  decreased by  or from fiscal year net sales of  primarily due to the decrease in value of the memory content we purchased on behalf of certain customers and included in the related sales 
this decrease was caused by the significant decline in dram component prices experienced throughout fiscal year and was partially offset by the increased unit volume of commercial stacks shipped during the year 
for the commercial high density product  the revenues for products containing the memory components we purchased decreased to of total revenues as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the purchased memory had an established contract price  and therefore did not expose dpac to price volatility risks for memory components 
the unit quantity of commercial stacks shipped during the year increased by over the previous fiscal year  offset by a decrease in the average selling price of approximately for commercial stacking services 
exclusive of memory content  this resulted in a net increase in commercial stacking revenues of  or in fiscal year over fiscal year royalty revenues deceased by  during fiscal year we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary  typehaus  in november typehaus generated zero revenues for fiscal year as compared to  or of revenues for fiscal year export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year  as a new european customer accepted our commercial stacking technology 
cost of sales for fiscal year was  or of sales  as compared to  or for fiscal year the decrease in cost of sales percent is directly related to the decreased percentage of revenues from commercial products for which we purchased the memory components 
the cost of purchased memory is passed through to the customer  but does not contain a significant profit element 
thus  while there is not an impact on total margin  the gross margin percent is impacted by purchased memory content 
for fiscal year  approximately  of commercial orders contained procured memory as compared to  for fiscal year the balance of the commercial orders had consigned memory associated with the sale 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased by  or in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales was in both fiscal years 
the decrease in dollar amount is primarily attributed to the reduction in legal expenses associated with defending and prosecuting a patent infringement lawsuit by  see related discussion on the patent litigation and the consolidation of the facility  obtained from the previous year s acquisition  into the garden grove facility during the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  the typehaus subsidiary was sold at the end of the third quarter of  eliminating the associated general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill was  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increase represents amortization associated with the pep acquisition  which was consummated in the third quarter of fiscal year in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be evaluated at least annually for impairment and written down when the recorded value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas on march  as a result  the company will cease amortization of goodwill  reducing annual amortization expense by approximately  research and development expense was  or of net sales  in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year this represents an increase of  or in fiscal year from fiscal year the continued investment in research and development is primarily due to continued efforts to allocate resources to the development and production of unique new technologies 
the company is continuing to invest in research and development for new products in the advanced technology marketplace 
see forward looking statements 
interest expense increased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the interest rates on outstanding capital leases 
interest income decreased by  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the decline in interest rates that we were able to earn on our short term investments 
other expense in fiscal year of  relates to the loss on disposal of typehaus 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year net sales of  increased by  from fiscal year sales of  primarily due to fewer customers supplying the memory to be used in manufacturing the related products  which increased the cost of the manufactured products and the related sales prices 
the actual quantity of commercial stacks shipped during the year decreased by from the quantity of stacks shipped in the previous fiscal year 
the industrial  defense and aerospace portion of the business remained flat in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of the overall business revenue total net sales 
our industrial  defense and aerospace business will continue to be subject to risks affecting the defense industry  including changes in government appropriations and changes in national defense policies and priorities 
pep contributed approximately  in net sales since the acquisition date 
export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary  typehaus  in november prior to the sale  typehaus generated  of net sales  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended february  as compared to  or of net sales  for fiscal year cost of sales for fiscal year was  of sales  as compared to  of sales in fiscal year the increase can be attributed to fewer customers supplying the memory to be used in manufacturing the related products 
as a result  dpac purchased the memory  which increased our cost of sales and reduced our gross margins 
the purchased memory had an established contract price  and therefore did not expose dpac to price volatility of memory components 
additionally  there was a decrease of in commercial stacked components shipped during the fiscal year  which adversely impacted the gross margin due to lower manufacturing utilization 
we were able to maintain operating efficiencies in producing the commercial stacks  but experienced periods where the demand was lagging  resulting in down time for equipment and personnel 
the quick turn of commercial products is important for the success of our customers and  as a result  it is important for us to maintain staffing levels to be able to offer the quick turn ability 
this creates uneven commercial production periods when orders are insufficient to cover the manufacturing operating expenses 
automated equipment is used exclusively for the production of the commercial stacks 
by utilizing the automated equipment for essentially one product  the efficiencies of equipment and personnel are increased for potentially better margins in production runs of that product 
see cautionary statements 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expense represents a decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenue  as a percentage of sales for fiscal year as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a expense can be attributed to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of pep on october  specifically  pep incurred approximately  in sg a expenses subsequent to the acquisition date 
additionally  payroll and related expenses increased  due to new sales personnel and an increase in wages for hourly employees 
this was offset by a decrease in sales commissions associated with a decrease in the number of commercial stacks shipped in the current year and a decrease in bonus expense and profit sharing as the result of the decreased profitability of the company during fiscal year also during the fiscal year  our legal costs of defending and prosecuting a patent infringement lawsuit increased by  in addition to an increase in the legal costs associated with new patent filings 
research and development expense increased for fiscal year to  an increase of  or 
from  in fiscal year due to continued work on several commercial plastic stack products that we are currently selling and work on new products for three dimensional technology stacking 
we are continuing to invest in research and development for new products in the industrial  defense and aerospace and the commercial marketplace 
research and development represented approximately of sales for fiscal year s and amortization of goodwill was  in fiscal year and represents amortization associated with the pep acquisition 
interest expense decreased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily associated with lower debt levels 
there were no new capital leases entered into during fiscal year and several leases reached the end of their terms in the current year 
interest income increased  or  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to interest earned on our higher cash balances in fiscal year other expense in fiscal year of  principally relates to the loss or disposal of typehaus  which included  of stock compensation associated with an acceleration of vesting on certain stock options 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity during the three years ended february  was cash generated from operations 
cash provided by operating activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively  and substantially consisted of net income and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by net decreases in operating assets and liabilities of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash payments related to the pep acquisition consisted of a  payment of an acquired tax liability in fiscal year and  as part of the purchase price in fiscal year cash used for the purchase of manufacturing and test equipment  computers and tooling was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending february  net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal year and net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal year the primary uses of funds for financing activities consist of principal payments on long term debt of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary sources of funds from financing activities are proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of february   our future commitments under capital leases and term debt through fiscal year were  as of april   we were in compliance with the covenants  terms and conditions of our leases and debt instruments 
additionally  we have an available credit facility with a financial institution  for up to three million dollars  based on eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires in november the company must also meet certain financial ratios  which we were in compliance with at february  we ended fiscal year with a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compares to a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to at the end of fiscal year management believes that this positive cash position  together with working capital  cash from operations  and the current credit facility  should be adequate to implement management s business plan and to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from operations  an increase in manufacturing capabilities  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
if internally generated funds are inadequate  we may scale back expenditures or seek other financing  which might include sales of equity securities that could dilute existing shareholders

the provisions of this statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company has adopted the requirements of this standard 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact on the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating results for any of the three years ended february  risk factors cautionary statements statements in this prospectus which are not historical facts  including all statements about the company s business strategy or expectations  or information about new and existing products and technologies or market characteristics and conditions  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to  the factors described below which could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
product development and technological change the semiconductor and memory module industries are characterized by rapid technological change and are highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation 
the company s memory products are subject to obsolescence or price erosion because semiconductor manufacturers are continuously introducing chips with the same or greater memory density as the company s custom modules 
as a result  memory products typically have a product life of not more than three to five years 
the company s future success depends on its ability to develop new products and product enhancements to keep up with technological advances and to meet customer needs 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its product development or marketing efforts  or that the company will have adequate financial or technical resources for future product development and promotion 
uncertainty of market acceptance or profitability of new products the introduction of new products will require the expenditure of funds for research and development  tooling  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to achieve high volume production  the company will need to make substantial investments in inventory and capital equipment or  as currently contemplated  the company will need to out source production to third parties 
the company has limited marketing capabilities and resources and is dependent upon internal sales and marketing personnel and a network of independent sales representatives for the marketing and sale of its products 
there can be no assurance that our products will achieve or maintain market acceptance  result in increased revenues  or be profitable 
parts shortages and over supplies and dependence on suppliers the semiconductor industry is characterized by periodic shortages or over supplies of parts which have in the past and may in the future negatively affect the company s operations 
the company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for semiconductor devices used in its products  and it has no long term supply contracts with any of them 
for example  the company was not able to market its second generation dense stack product when it lost its source of sram die 
due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and competitive conditions  the company may experience difficulties in meeting its supply requirements in the future 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries of parts  either due to the loss of a supplier or industry wide shortages  could delay shipments of the company s products  increase its cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of credit risk the company grants credit to customers included in the military  aerospace  and a variety of commercial industries 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is not required 
estimated credit losses are provided for in the financial statements 
during the year ended february   sales to three major customers accounted for  and of net sales 
accounts receivable from these three customers accounted for of total accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   of net sales were to one major customer 
accounts receivable from this customer accounted for of total net accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   sales to three major customers accounted for  and of net sales 
accounts receivable from these three customers accounted for of total net accounts receivable at february  a decision by a significant customer to substantially decrease or delay purchases from the company or the company s inability to collect receivables from these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on defense related business the company has historically derived a portion of its revenues from defense related contracts 
as a result  the company s business has been impacted by reductions in the federal defense budget and will continue to be subject to risks affecting the defense industry  including changes in governmental appropriations and changes in national defense policies and priorities 
the company has sought to reduce its dependence on defense related business by developing products with commercial applications  although such products generally have lower margins than defense related products 
intellectual property rights the company s ability to compete effectively is dependent on its proprietary know how  technology and patent rights 
the company holds us patents on certain aspects of its d stacking technology and has applied for additional patents 
there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications will be approved  that any issued patents will afford the company s products any competitive advantage or will not be challenged or circumvented by third parties  or that patents issued to others will not adversely affect the sales  development or commercialization of the company s present or future products 
management of growth successful expansion of the company s operations will depend on  among other things  the ability to obtain new customers  to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel  to secure adequate sources of supply on commercially reasonable terms and to successfully manage growth 
to manage growth effectively  the company will have to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls 
as the company expands  it may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
competition there are memory companies which offer or are in the process of developing three dimensional products  including irvine sensors  staktek  samsung and others 
some of such companies have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing capabilities than the company 
the company could also experience competition from established and emerging computer memory companies 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be competitive with existing or future products  or that the company will be able to establish or maintain a profitable price structure for its products 
product liability in the course of its business  the company may be subject to claims for product liability for which its insurance coverage is excluded or inadequate 
variability of gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal year ended february  as compared to for the fiscal year ended february   and for the fiscal year ended february  any change in the gross margins can typically be attributed to the type of products  and the amount of purchased memory included in sales  that the company was selling during the year as well as the royalty income generated during the periods 
as the company markets its products both to military and aerospace  and commercial customers  the product mix that each category of the customers orders may be different and result in changes in the gross margin 
due to the various configuration and applications of the company s product  prices range from less than for commercial custom modules to over two thousand dollars for high end military specification custom modules 
the company expects that its net sales and gross margin may vary significantly based on these and other factors  including the mix of products sold and the manufacturing services provided  the channels through which the company s products are sold  changes in product selling prices and component costs  the level of manufacturing efficiencies achieved and pricing by competitors 
the selling prices of the company s products may decline depending upon the price changes of dram  sram and flash semiconductors  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase net sales will be highly dependent upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices 
declining product selling prices may also materially and adversely affect the company s gross margin unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset declines in product selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce its cost per unit 
the company also expects that its business may experience significant seasonality to the extent it sells a material portion of its products in europe and to the extent its exposure to the personal computer market remains significant 
decline of demand for product due to downturn of related industries the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to factors affecting the semiconductor  computer  telecommunications and networking industries 
from time to time  each of these industries has experienced downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
a decline or significant shortfall in growth in any one of these industries could have a material adverse impact on the demand for the company s products and therefore a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in the semiconductor  computer  telecommunications  networking or other industries utilizing the company s products 
fluctuations in operating results the company s results of operations and gross margin have been subject to fluctuations from period to period 
the primary factors that have affected and may in the future affect the company s results of operations include adverse changes in the mix of products sold  the inability to procure required components  and the partial or complete loss of a principal customer or the reduction in orders from a customer due to  among other things  excess product inventory accumulation by such customer 
other factors that have affected and may in the future affect the company s results of operations include fluctuating market demand for and declines in the selling prices of the company s products  decreases or increases in the costs of the components of the company s products  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s products  the company s competitors selling products that compete with the company s products at lower prices or on better terms than the company s products  delays in the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new product introductions  and the company s semiconductor customers manufacturing memory custom modules  internally or with other third parties  outside of the united states due to concerns about united states antidumping investigations and laws 
the company s operating results may also be affected by the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  the timing of significant orders  the ability to produce products in volume  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or other events  inventory obsolescence  including the reduction in value of the company s inventories due to price declines  unexpected product returns  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in the company s targeted markets  and expenses associated with acquisitions 
in particular  declines in dram  sram and flash semiconductor prices could affect the valuation of the company s inventory which could result in adverse changes in the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of the company s individual products and product lines toward the end of a product s life cycle are typically characterized by steep declines in sales  pricing and gross margin  the precise timing of which may be difficult to predict 
the company has experienced and could continue to experience unexpected reductions in sales of products as customers anticipate new product purchases 
in addition  to the extent that the company manufactures products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders during a period of either declining product selling prices or decreasing demand  the company could experience an unanticipated decrease in sales of products 
these factors could give rise to charges for obsolete or excess inventory  returns of products by distributors  or substantial price protection charges or discounts 
in the past  the company has had to write down and write off excess or obsolete inventory 
to the extent that the company is unsuccessful in managing product transitions  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the need for continued significant expenditures for capital equipment purchases  research and development and ongoing customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its operating expenses in any particular period if the company s expectations for net sales for that period are not met 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to be profitable 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of the company s financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future period the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s securities would be materially and adversely affected 
international sales in fiscal year  approximately of the company s sales were export sales  primarily to western europe as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal year foreign sales are made in us dollars 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of a significant new international customer in fiscal year international sales may be subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  natural disasters  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences and uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances 
moreover and as a result of currency changes and other factors  certain of the company s competitors may have the ability to manufacture competitive products in asia at lower costs than the company 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of the company s products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
because sales of the company s products have been denominated to date in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of the company s products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
some of the company s customer s purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from united states laws 
therefore  the company may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under such agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited experience in acquisition we may pursue selective acquisitions to complement our internal growth 
if we make any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses  product lines and technologies 
in addition  the attention of our small management team may be diverted from our core business if we undertake an acquisition 
potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including  among others problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  costs associated with the acquisition  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  and potential litigation arising from the acquired company s operations before the acquisition 
our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions could divert the attention of management  utilize scarce corporate resources and harm our business 
in addition  we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
cyclical nature of semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry  including the memory markets in which we compete  is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
furthermore  any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased demand for  and possible shortages of  components we use to manufacture and assemble our ics 
such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
product returns and order cancellation to the extent we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders  we could experience an unanticipated increase in our inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers 
product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues 
we have had to write down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence  excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs 
we have no long term volume commitments from our customers except those subject to cancellation by the customer 
sales of our products are made through individual purchase orders and  in certain cases  are made under master agreements governing the terms and conditions of the relationships 
customers may change  cancel or delay orders with limited or no penalties 
we have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period to period and we expect to continue to experience similar cancellations and fluctuations in the future which could result in fluctuations in our revenues 
additional capital funding to impair value of investment if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our research  development  sales and marketing activities
