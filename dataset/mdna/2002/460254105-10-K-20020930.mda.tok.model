for the months ended june  semiconductor industry association data shows a percent decline in semiconductor industry revenues  whereas ir s revenues declined by percent during this period 
despite this challenging environment  revenues from ir s proprietary products analog ics  advanced circuit devices  and power systems grew by percent and comprised half of product revenues in fiscal  compared to percent in royalties contributed million to revenues  compared to million in in line with the industry downturn  ir experienced a percent decline year over year in the information technology sector and a percent decline in revenues in the industrial sector for fiscal however  the company returned to sequential revenue growth in the second half  with revenues increasing percent sequentially over the first half of fiscal notwithstanding the downturn  ir achieved growth in several target sectors 
ir strengthened its position in the aerospace and defense sector by securing multiple sole source design wins in leading defense and satellite programs 
revenues from this sector grew percent over the prior year 
revenues from the consumer electronics market rose percent  reflecting increased demand for applications in high end household appliances 
including acquisitions  revenues from the automotive sector grew percent compared to fiscal excluding acquisitions  ir s revenue growth in the automotive sector was approximately percent 
orders for our proprietary products represented more than half of total bookings for fiscal orders climbed percent sequentially in the fourth quarter  including bookings from technofusion 
shipments into the distribution channel declined by percent year over year  but strengthened in the fourth quarter  rising percent from the third quarter level 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired the assets of european semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
and the high reliability power mosfet line of fairchild semiconductor 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed the acquisition of technofusion gmbh  a leading maker of power generation products for the automotive industry  from royal philips electronics 
in total  these acquisitions contributed about million to the company s revenues for the year 
gross profit margin gross profit was million of revenues in  versus million of revenues in  including an inventory write down of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal without the write down  gross profit in was percent of revenues 
strength in higher margin proprietary products helped to counter the impact of price declines  lower production volumes for components  and lower royalties 
operating expenses in  selling and administrative expense was million of revenues  versus million of revenues in the comparable year ago period 
the decline in absolute spending reflected the benefits of our cost containment programs and selling commissions paid on a lower sales base and was partially offset by million from acquisitions 
expenses rose as a percentage of revenues because of lower sales compared to in  our research and development expenditures were million of revenues  compared to million of revenues in the prior year period 
we continue to invest in the development of new proprietary products for information technology  automotive  aerospace and defense  and home appliances and other motion control applications 
in  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was million of revenues  compared to million of revenues in in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce 
interest income and expenses interest income was million and million for the year ended june  and  respectively 
the figure primarily reflected the impact of lower interest rates 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease principally reflected realized savings from the million notional amount interest rate swap transaction with jp morgan chase bank 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements note other income and expenses in  we reached a settlement with our insurance carrier for equipment that was damaged at one of our wafer fabrication lines see note 
we recognized a million gain for the involuntary conversion of the damaged equipment 
the gain primarily represents the excess of the proceeds received and used to replace the damaged equipment over the net book value of the replaced equipment 
additionally  a resulting net gain on the settlement of the claim of million was recorded within other income and expenses 
net foreign currency losses and gains in fiscal and  respectively  were less than million in each year 
income taxes our effective tax rate in and was approximately percent  which differed from the us federal statutory tax rate of percent and reflected the benefits of foreign tax credits  research and development credits and state tax credits  partially offset by higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign jurisdiction losses without foreign tax benefit  and higher state taxes 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues revenues for were million versus revenues of million in the overall growth of percent in revenues reflected strong business conditions early in the year 
revenues for our proprietary products analog ics  advanced circuit devices  and power systems grew percent  to comprise percent of product revenues in compared to percent of product revenues in component product revenues increased percent  but declined  as a percent of revenues  by percent from the prior year  reflecting a drop off in demand for the multi market products that account for about percent of our business 
net patent royalties contributed million to revenues  compared to million in  reflecting market growth  operative changes in license agreements and the expiration of the royalty sharing agreement with unitrode corporation 
our revenues from selected information technology  automotive  aerospace and industrial applications increased by percent over the prior year 
demand in the telecom datacom subsector which includes servers  routers  and infrastructure began to show signs of weakness late in the third quarter fourth quarter results reflected worsening business conditions 
shipments into the information technology sector  which accounted for percent of our business during  declined in the fourth quarter by percent sequentially 
late in the fourth quarter  weakness in demand also spread to the industrial market 
pricing for multi market products declined sequentially by nearly percent 
in the face of continuing price pressure and widespread concerns about semiconductor industry conditions through the balance of the calendar year  we took steps to align ir s cost structure with our revised outlook and financial targets 
in light of the above business conditions  we recorded an million pretax restructuring charge for the writedown of assets  the writedown of inventory  and severance 
see further discussion of the june restructuring charge below 
including the impact of the restructuring charge recognized in  we generated net income of million or per share  compared to the prior year s net income of million or per share 
excluding the charge  income for the full year was million or per share 
the increase in earnings in compared to is attributed to higher sales volume  a higher proportion of proprietary products  manufacturing efficiencies and higher interest income from our investments 
gross profit margin gross profit was million of revenues in  versus million of revenues in in the fourth quarter  million was charged to cost of sales for the writedown of inventory as a result of the market downturn 
excluding the inventory charge  gross profit for fiscal was percent of revenues 
the gross margin increase reflected a higher proportion of revenues from our proprietary products  increased royalty income  and cost reductions 
operating expenses in  selling and administrative expense was million of revenues  versus million of revenues in the comparable year ago period 
the increase was attributable to commissions paid on higher sales revenues 
a lower ratio of selling and administrative expense to revenues reflects the results of greater efficiencies and higher sales volume 
in  our research and development expenditures increased to million of revenues compared to million of revenues in the comparable prior year period 
the million increase reflects  among other things  initiatives to accelerate the development of new proprietary products for automotive  information technology  appliances  and other motion control applications 
we plan to maintain our current research and development spending level 
in  amortization of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets was million of revenues  principally related to the acquisitions of omnirel llc  advanced analog  inc  unisem  inc 
and the assets of magnitude llc 
interest income and expenses interest income increased from million in to million in due to higher levels of cash and short term investments 
interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase was a result of the million convertible notes sold in july other income and expenses net foreign currency gains and losses were less than million in each year 
income taxes our effective tax rate in was approximately percent  which differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of percent  due primarily to the benefits of foreign tax and research and development credits  partially offset by higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign jurisdiction losses without foreign tax benefit and higher state taxes 
our effective tax rate for was approximately percent  which differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of percent  due primarily to a decrease in valuation allowance  the benefits of foreign tax and research and development credits  partially offset by higher statutory rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and foreign jurisdiction losses without foreign tax benefit 
june restructuring charge in response to the impact on our business of the semiconductor industry downturn and the corresponding weakness in demand  we recorded an million pretax restructuring charge in the quarter ended june the charge consisted of million for the writedown of assets  million for the writedown of inventory  and million in personnel severance payments 
the asset writedown of million included both asset impairment and the recognition of assets to be disposed of or abandoned 
in determining if an asset was impaired  we evaluated estimated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors such as changes in strategy or technology 
in determining the amount of impairment losses  we reduced the carrying value of the asset to its expected discounted future cash flow or to an amount deemed recoverable by management after considering all relevant factors 
the asset writedown included the following a an uncompleted wafer fabrication bay at our facility in temecula  california with a carrying value of million  was adjusted to a fair value of million 
we had no current plans to utilize these site specific assets or complete the construction of the wafer bay  b equipment no longer utilized  located at our subcontract assembly facilities in southeast asia with a carrying value of million  was written off  c building improvements and certain production lines at our facilities in the united kingdom with a carrying value of million were adjusted to a fair value of million 
these production lines were operating at very low utilization and we had no plans for future production  d building improvements and wafer and assembly equipment in italy with a carrying value of million were adjusted to a fair value of million 
these production lines were idle with no plans for future use  and production of certain products was transferred to our facilities in india  e information systems applications with a carrying value of million were written down primarily as a result of a move to a new datacom telecom infrastructure and the implementation of changes to our financial reporting systems  and f under the terms of certain of our subcontract assembly agreements in southeast asia  we had the obligation to purchase back million of equipment because our order volume fell below predetermined thresholds 
order volumes were not expected to increase to a level which would relieve the obligation  and we had no other plans to utilize the equipment 
the million inventory writedown reflected a loss of utility as a result of the impact of the semiconductor industry downturn and weak demand in our end markets 
in determining the inventory charge  we addressed the following factors a market conditions made certain customer specific inventory excessive 
in light of current market conditions  we did not expect to sell a large portion of this inventory  b we had built up inventory during fiscal to support a revenue level significantly higher than revised projections for our it customers current generation of datacom telecom equipment 
reduced demand for these customer products made inventory levels excessive and reduced the expected recoverability  and c we had excess inventory that we expect would be sold at prices lower than its historical cost 
in line with management s expectations  substantially all of the inventory written down at june  was disposed of during the year 
in the quarter ended june  we recorded a million charge for employee severance associated with the elimination of positions related to a reduction in company wide administrative staff levels and a reduction in operating personnel at our facilities in the united kingdom 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal y ear  we announced a further workforce reduction of approximately positions 
we have absorbed the cost of this workforce reduction into fiscal year operations 
we expect to reduce costs by approximately million by the end of calendar year as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring activities and the reduction in workforce announced in the first quarter of fiscal the projected savings will consist primarily of lower direct labor costs  lower depreciation expense and lower selling and administrative costs 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and cash investments in marketable debt securities of million 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments in marketable debt securities and unused credit facilities of million  totaled million 
our investment portfolio consists of available for sale fixed income  investment grade securities with maturities of up to months 
during  operating activities generated cash flow of million compared to million in the prior year period 
working capital increased by million this fiscal year period  primarily related to a reduction in accrued taxes  accrued interest and accounts payable  partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
during  cash used in investing activities totaled million 
we added million in capital equipment  and we sold million of investments in marketable debt securities 
in the second half of fiscal year  we acquired certain business assets of european semiconductor manufacturing  ltd  certain business assets of fairchild semiconductor corporation  and the business of technofusion gmbh and certain related assets for approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year were primarily related to investments in manufacturing equipment  of which the majority is used to produce proprietary products 
additionally  at june   we had made purchase commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
we intend to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations 
financing activities during fiscal year generated million 
as of june   we had revolving  equipment and foreign credit facilities of million  against which million had been utilized 
as discussed in note  we are required to obtain irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of jp morgan chase bank  for million plus a collateral requirement for the interest rate swap transaction  as determined periodically 
at june   million in letters of credit were outstanding related to the transaction 
the collateral requirement of the transaction may be adversely affected by an increase in the five year libor curve  a decrease in our stock price  or both 
we cannot predict what the collateral requirement of the transaction and the letter of credit requirement will be over time 
to illustrate the potential impact  had a percent increase in the five year libor curve and a percent decrease in our stock price occurred at the close of the fiscal year  our letter of credit commitment would have been approximately million 
for the possible effects of environmental matters on liquidity  see note we lease certain of our administrative  research and development and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
future minimum operating lease obligations are as follows fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal  fiscal million  and million thereafter 
future minimum capital lease obligations are million in both fiscal and in july  we sold million principal amount of percent convertible subordinated notes due the interest rate is percent per annum on the principal amount  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on january and july of each year  beginning january the notes are convertible into shares of the ir s common stock at any time on or before july   at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction that modified the interest characteristic on million of our outstanding convertible debt  see item a 
in november  we entered into a three year syndicated multi currency revolving credit facility the credit facility led by bnp paribas  which provided a credit line of million  of which up to million may be used for standby letters of credit 
the credit agreement allows borrowings by ir s foreign subsidiaries and provides funding for ir s general corporate purposes 
the facility bears interest at i local currency rates plus ii a margin between percent and percent for base rate advances and a margin of between percent and percent for euro currency rate advances 
other advances bear interest as set forth in the credit agreement 
the annual commitment fee for the credit agreement is percent of the unused portion of the credit facility 
as of june   total scheduled principal payments on the credit facility  convertible subordinated notes  and other debt obligations are as follows fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal  fiscal million  and million thereafter 
we believe that our current cash and cash investment balances  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  including unused amounts under the million credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operations and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they occur in the next months 
although we believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient for normal operating activities  we may also consider the use of funds from other external sources  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of debt or equity

such forward looking materials are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
financial results are to a large extent dependent on the power mosfet segments of the power semiconductor industry 
if market demand does not continue to grow  revenue growth may be impacted  manufacturing capacity might be underutilized  capital spending might be slowed  and our performance might be negatively impacted 
additional factors that could affect actual results include the failure of market demand to materialize as anticipated  weakness or program or order postponements in the information technology sector of our business  the effectiveness of cost controls and cost reductions  litigation and other unexpected costs associated with cost reduction efforts  including reductions in force and the transfer and consolidation of product lines and equipment  the effectiveness of integration of acquisitions into our operations  our ability and timing to achieve strategic acquisitions and the effect of associated costs  the availability of government incentives  the accuracy of customers forecasts  product claims  returns and recalls  market and sector conditions that affect our customers  licensees and suppliers  introduction  acceptance  availability and continued demand and growth of new and high performance products  delays in transferring and ramping production lines or completing customer qualifications  company and market impact due to the cancellation or delays in customer and or industry programs or orders  our mix of product shipments  availability of adequate capacity and unanticipated costs of refurbishment or replacement of equipment  pricing pressures  the success of working capital management programs  failure of suppliers and subcontractors to meet their delivery commitments  unfavorable changes in industry and competitive conditions  impact of any disruption in  or increased cost of  electricity and or other critical supplies  economic conditions in our markets around the world and the timing of changes in market conditions  changes in interest and investment rates  impacts on our business or financial condition due to changes in currency valuation or to the euro conversion  impact of changes in accounting methods  the impact of changes in laws and regulations  including tax  trade  and export regulations and policies  the actual results of any outstanding patent and other litigation  and other uncertainties disclosed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including  without limitation  our s filing of october  additionally  to the foregoing factors should be added the financial and other ramifications of terrorist actions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including changes in interest rates affecting our return on investments and foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we do not hold or purchase any foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flow by entering into forward exchange contracts which are intended to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analyses 
interest rate risk our financial assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk are our investments in debt securities  our convertible debt and our interest rate swap transaction 
our primary objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on these transactions 
an adverse change of as much as percent change in the interest rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the transaction with an investment bank  jp morgan chase bank the bank  to modify the interest characteristic of our outstanding convertible debt the debt 
see note the notional amount of the transaction is million  representing percent of the debt 
we will receive from the bank fixed payments equal to percent of the notional amount  payable on january and july starting on january  in exchange  we will pay to the bank floating rate payments based upon the london interbank offered rate libor multiplied by the notional amount of the transaction 
during fiscal  this arrangement reduced interest expense by million 
we valued the transaction and the debt on the transaction date 
the mark to market adjustment of the transaction included in long term other assets was approximately million at june  in april  we entered into an interest rate contract the contract with an investment bank  lehman brothers lehman  to reduce the variable interest rate risk of the transaction 
the notional amount of the contract is million  representing percent of the debt 
under the terms of the contract  we have the option to receive a payout from lehman covering our exposure to libor fluctuations between percent and percent for any four designated quarters 
the contract was valued at million at inception and will be marked to market at each balance sheet date in accordance with sfas no 
at june   the mark to market adjustment of the contract was million 
the mark to market adjustments of the contract will be charged to interest expense through the contract s termination date 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in several foreign currencies 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
the objective of these forward contracts is to neutralize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on the operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign currency transactions 
we do not use forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the fair value of our combined foreign currency position related to our outstanding forward contracts 
if we had experienced an adverse change in foreign exchange rates of as much as percent  the potential change in our foreign currency position would have had an immaterial effect on the results of our operations  financial position and cash flows 
in march  we entered into a year foreign exchange forward contract the forward contract  designated as a cash flow hedge  for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our subsidiary in japan 
under the terms of the forward contract  we are required to exchange billion yen for million on a quarterly basis from june to march at june   quarterly payments of billion yen remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of yen per us dollar 
at june   a mark to market adjustment  net of tax  of million was reflected in the balance sheet 
at june   based on effectiveness tests comparing forecasted transactions through the forward contract expiration date to the forward contract s cash flow requirements  the company does not expect to incur a material charge to income during the next twelve months 
we had approximately million and million of forward contracts not designated as hedges at june  and  respectively 
unrealized losses of million and million were recognized in earnings as of june  and  respectively 
the net realized foreign currency transaction gain was million for the year ended june
