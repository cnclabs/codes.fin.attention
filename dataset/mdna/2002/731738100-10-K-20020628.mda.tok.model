item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below in the section titled factors affecting future operating results in this annual report on form k 
overview business polymedica is a leading provider of direct to consumer medical products and services  conducting business through our chronic care  professional products and consumer healthcare segments 
through our chronic care segment  we sell diabetes supplies and related products and provide services to medicare eligible seniors suffering from diabetes and related chronic diseases 
through our professional products segment we provide direct to consumer prescription respiratory supplies and services to medicare eligible seniors suffering from copd 
we also market  manufacture and distribute a broad line of prescription urological and suppository products 
in addition  during fiscal  we began selling prescription oral medications not covered by medicare to our existing customers through our professional products segment 
our azo products are distributed primarily to food and drug retailers and mass merchandisers nationwide through our consumer healthcare segment 
our azo brand holds a leading position in the over the counter otc urinary health market 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of polymedica s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
polymedica s significant accounting policies are presented within note b to our consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
while all of our accounting policies impact the consolidated financial statements  certain policies may be viewed to be critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition and sales allowances  accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  direct response advertising  amounts due to medicare and others  and uncertainties 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue related to product sales to customers who have placed orders upon shipment  provided that risk of loss has passed to the customer and we have received and verified the required written forms to bill medicare if applicable  other third party payers  and customers 
we record revenue at the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payers  and directly from customers 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including a review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  historical experience  and the credit worthiness of customers 
the determination of appropriate medicare rates for billing and revenue recognition are subjective and complex and therefore require management s interpretation 
sales allowances are recorded for estimated product returns as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze sales allowances using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume  customer demographics  and business conditions 
these allowances are adjusted to reflect actual returns 
changes in these factors could effect the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the valuation of accounts receivable is based upon the credit worthiness of customers and third party payers as well as our historical collection experience 
allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense for estimated amounts expected to be uncollectible from third party payers and customers 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  and on our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category 
changes in judgment regarding these factors could effect the timing and amount of costs recognized 
inventories the carrying value of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  and pricing 
due to the medical nature of the products we provide  customers sometimes request supplies before we have received the required written forms to bill medicare if applicable  other third party payers  and customers 
as a result  included in inventories are items shipped to customers for which we have received an order but have not yet received the required written documents and therefore have not recognized revenue 
the carrying value of inventory shipped to customers is based upon historical experience of collection of documents required to bill medicare if applicable  other third party payers  and customers 
changes in judgment regarding the recoverability of inventories  including the carrying value of inventory shipped to customers  could result in the recording of additional income or expense 
direct response advertising in accordance with statement of position sop we capitalize and amortize direct response advertising and related costs when we can demonstrate that customers have directly responded to our advertisements 
we assess the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net cash flows expected to result directly from such advertising 
a business change that impacts expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
amounts due to medicare and others the determination of appropriate medicare rates for billing are subjective and complex 
amounts due to medicare and others are recorded when  based upon our assessment of the facts and circumstances  we believe that the amounts due are probable and estimable 
changes in judgment regarding amounts due to medicare and others could result in income or expenses that are different from our estimates 
uncertainties the regulations that govern medicare reimbursement are complex and our compliance with those regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies  including the department of health and human services  the doj  and the fda 
the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  is conducting investigations of alleged healthcare fraud by liberty medical and liberty home pharmacy 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating fully with the investigations 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings at this time  and have not recorded any charges related to the outcome of these uncertainties in our march  consolidated financial statements 
if any of these investigations results in a determination that we have failed to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting or have otherwise committed healthcare fraud or securities law violations  we could be subject to delays or loss of reimbursement  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions that could  either individually or in the aggregate  materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
polymedica and three of its officers are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
in addition  there is a derivative action against the directors and two officers of polymedica in massachusetts state court alleging certain breaches of fiduciary duty 
polymedica  the named officers  and the board of directors believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims made against them in the actions in which they are defendants and intend to contest the claims vigorously 
although we do not consider an unfavorable outcome to the various claims probable  we cannot accurately predict their ultimate disposition  and have therefore not recorded any charges related to the outcome of these uncertainties 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
recent transactions on february   all outstanding minority interests in our subsidiaries previously held by certain company executives  having a recorded book value of million as of february   were reacquired by the respective subsidiaries at no cost and are classified as additional paid in capital in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets as of march  as a result of these transactions  there were no outstanding minority interests in polymedica or any of its subsidiaries as of march  other we do not believe our net product sales  in the aggregate  are subject to material seasonal fluctuations 
other non direct response advertising  promotional  and marketing costs are charged to earnings in the period in which they are incurred 
promotional and sample costs whose benefit is expected to assist future sales are expensed as the related materials are used 
we operate from manufacturing and distribution facilities located in massachusetts and florida 
virtually all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
expense items include cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of sales consists primarily of purchased finished goods for sale in our markets and  to a lesser extent  materials  direct labor  and overhead costs for products that we manufacture in our facility and shipping and handling fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for personnel and benefits  as well as legal and related expenses  allowances for bad debts  rent  amortization of capitalized direct response advertising costs and other amortization and depreciation 
period to period comparisons of changes in net revenues are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  total net revenues increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of the growth in revenues from our chronic care and professional products segments which increased and  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  see note v to the consolidated financial statements for segment information 
net revenues in the chronic care segment increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this growth was due primarily to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
we currently expect our promotional and direct response advertising spending to increase in order to further the expansion of our chronic care segment 
revenue growth was aided by a cost of living adjustment implemented by the government for certain durable medical equipment products and services  including diabetes test strips  under the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of  which added to the revenue of many of our chronic care segment products beginning july  in addition  due to the late implementation by the government of the january  cost of living adjustment  which went into effect july   an incremental cost of living adjustment was recorded from july  to december  this incremental cost of living adjustment ended on december  net revenues from professional products increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was due primarily to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
as with our chronic care segment  we currently expect our promotional and direct response advertising spending to continue in order to further the expansion of our professional products segment 
net revenues from consumer healthcare products decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the sale of certain assets of our thermometry business in september as a percentage of total net revenues  overall gross margins were in the fiscal year ended march  and in the fiscal year ended march  gross margins in the fiscal year ended march  increased slightly due primarily to a cost of living adjustment described above  and increased sales in our higher margin professional products segment  partially offset by a change in the interpretation of the reimbursement formula for albuterol and ipratropium combinations see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more details  increasing sales from new business initiatives that have lower margins than our average and a change in the product mix for our chronic care and professional products segments 
as a percentage of total net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended march   as compared with for the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in the fiscal year ended march  to million  as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributable to unusual legal and related expenses of million and a charge of million for probable amounts due to medicare and others which relates to a change in interpretation of the reimbursement formula for albuterol and ipratropium combinations used in our professional products segment  in the fiscal year ended march  we do not expect any further charges to income as a result of this change in interpretation 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the unusual legal and related expenses incurred in the fiscal year ended march  of approximately million were primarily attributable to previously reported investigations of liberty medical and liberty home pharmacy 
we expect that we will continue to incur unusual legal and related expenses in the fiscal year ending march  selling  general and administrative expenses further increased due to an increase in direct response advertising amortization of million to million in the fiscal year ended march   from million in the fiscal year ended march  amortization increased as a result of the growth in the direct response advertising asset value 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
investment income  net decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due to a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with  in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the elimination of interest expense on liberty medical s port st 
lucie facility mortgage as a result of the million repayment in december pretax income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million in the fiscal year ended march   a increase as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  the marginal increase was primarily attributable to approximately million of unusual legal and related expenses and a million adjustment to earnings for probable amounts due to medicare and others  recorded in the fiscal year ended march   without which the increase in pretax income would have been greater 
the provision for income taxes was million and million in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  which resulted in an effective tax rate of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in fiscal years and were higher than the federal us statutory rates due primarily to state taxes and other permanent differences 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for fiscal year will be at or near the fiscal effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to federal or state tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  or local income tax rates  and the deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
our income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes  was million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march  excluding million of unusual legal and related expenses  net of related taxes  and a million adjustment to earnings for probable amounts due to medicare and others  net of related taxes  earnings per diluted weighted average share were in the fiscal year ended march  net income was million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march  year ended march  compared to year ended march  total net revenues increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of the growth in revenues from our chronic care and professional products segments which increased and  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  see note v to the consolidated financial statements for segment information 
net revenues in the chronic care segment increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this growth was due primarily to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
we currently expect our promotional and direct response advertising spending to increase in order to further the expansion of our chronic care segment 
net revenues from professional products increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was mainly attributable to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
as with our chronic care segment  we currently expect our promotional and direct response advertising spending to increase in order to further the expansion of our professional products segment 
net revenues from consumer healthcare products decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due in large part to the sale of certain assets of our thermometry business in september as a percentage of total net revenues  overall gross margins were in the fiscal year ended march   and in the fiscal year ended march  gross margins in the fiscal year ended march  increased due primarily to improved gross margins in the chronic care segment  resulting from favorable product mix  increased sales volume and ongoing price reductions from suppliers  as well as increased sales volume and improving margins in the professional products segment 
as a percentage of total net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended march   as compared with for the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in the fiscal year ended march  to million  as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to increased amortization of direct response advertising of million and increased bad debt provisions of million 
investment income  net increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   as we earned interest on higher average cash balances primarily as a result of a full year of interest earned in fiscal on proceeds from our october secondary public offering 
interest expense decreased by to  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due to the october retirement of the guaranteed senior secured notes due january  the hancock notes to the john hancock mutual life insurance company hancock 
pretax income was million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in pretax income was primarily the result of increased sales volume and improved gross margins partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the provision for income taxes was million and million in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  which resulted in an effective tax rate of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in fiscal years and were higher than the federal us statutory rates due primarily to state taxes and other permanent differences 
our net income was million  or per diluted weighted average share  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million  or per diluted weighted average share in the fiscal year ended march  net income  excluding the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of related taxes  was million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared with net income  excluding the million extraordinary loss on retirement of debt  net of related taxes  of million  or per diluted weighted average share  for the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources our business is currently funded through cash flow from operations 
we have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of the last thirteen quarters and have reported positive annual cash flows from operations in each of the last fiscal years  with million  million  million  and  generated in the fiscal years ended march     and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased million to million as of march   due primarily to million of cash used for the repurchase of shares of our common stock plus cash used for capital expenditures for new facilities  offset by cash flows generated from operations 
cash flows from operations of million for the fiscal year ended march   were generated by net income of million  offset by cash used to fund certain areas of our operations  such as increased spending for direct response advertising of million to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   to further expand our customer base  both for diabetes testing and prescription respiratory supplies 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for future annual minimum lease and rental commitments as of march   under all of our leases  capital and operating capital operating in thousands leases leases and thereafter total minimum payments   in the fiscal years ended march  and  we used million and million of cash for investing activities  respectively 
the million increase in total cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a million increase in property  plant and equipment purchases in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  higher spending in the current fiscal year for property  plant and equipment is primarily related to the ongoing construction of two new facilities in port st 
lucie  florida included in the construction in process category of property  plant and equipment 
the cumulative amount spent through march  related to this construction was million  which will not be depreciated until the construction is completed 
in fiscal  we estimate that we will spend an additional million on the construction of these two new facilities  for which no liability has been recorded as of march   because we have no contractual obligation to complete the construction 
in the fiscal year ended march   we used million of cash for financing activities  million of which was used to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock on the open market  with any shares repurchased to be held in treasury 
in august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares 
as of march    shares had been repurchased under these programs for an aggregate of million or an average price of per share 
as of march    shares remained authorized for repurchase under the august authorized share repurchase program 
other financing activities included the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  payments of capital lease obligations and the setting aside of amounts for executive deferred compensation plans 
in november  we filed an amendment to a shelf registration statement originally filed in april  to enable us to offer from time to time  shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to million 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective during the quarter ended december  it will be in effect until november no shares of common stock had been sold under this shelf registration statement as of march  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march  of million  including cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet working capital  capital expenditure and financing needs for future business operations for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we undertake to make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may require substantial additional funding beyond currently available working capital and funds generated from operations 
we are conducting an active search for the strategic acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies which leverage our marketing  sales and distribution infrastructure 
we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
other factors which could negatively impact our liquidity include a reduction in the demand for our products or a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products 
we hold certain investments related to executive deferred compensation plans  see note b to the consolidated financial statements  which are accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
investments related to the executive deferred compensation plans  which have been classified as trading  are included in other assets and are recorded at fair value 
as of march   the fair value of these investments was not materially different from cost 
accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas supercedes accounting principles bulletin no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas supercedes accounting principles bulletin no 
 intangible assets 
these new statements require use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   thereby eliminating use of the pooling of interests method 
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be tested for impairment under a two step process 
under the first step  an entity s net assets are broken down into reporting units and compared to their fair value 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in addition  within six months of adopting the accounting standard  a transitional impairment test must be completed  and any impairments identified must be treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
additionally  new criteria have been established that determine whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted  as required  on april  the adoption of sfas could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we will replace ratable amortization of goodwill with periodic impairment tests 
impairment tests performed under sfas could indicate an impairment loss that would need to be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal we have not yet determined what effect these impairment tests will have on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
as a result of adopting sfas effective april   approximately million of goodwill amortization will not be recognized in fiscal in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas apply to all entities that incur obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and thus will be adopted  as required  on april  this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single model based on the framework established in sfas no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and thus will be adopted  as required  on april  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
this accounting pronouncement could have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations should there be future asset impairments or disposals 
factors affecting future operating results the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  but not limited to  statements regarding our expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include  among others statements regarding future benefits from our advertising and promotional expenditures  statements regarding future net revenue levels  statements regarding product development  introduction and marketing  and statements regarding future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
our future operating results remain difficult to predict 
we continue to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
we could experience significantly reduced profits if medicare changes  delays or denies reimbursement sales of a significant portion of our chronic care and professional products supplies depend on the continued availability of reimbursement of our customers by government and private insurance plans 
any reduction in medicare reimbursement currently available for our products would reduce our revenues 
without a corresponding reduction in the cost of such products  the result would be a reduction in our overall profit margin 
similarly  any increase in the cost of such products would reduce our overall profit margin unless there was a corresponding increase in medicare reimbursement 
our profits could also be affected by the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements for medicare reimbursement or adjustments to previously reimbursed amounts 
litigation may materially adversely affect us polymedica and three of its officers are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
in addition  there is a derivative action against the directors and two officers of polymedica in massachusetts state court alleging certain breaches of fiduciary duty 
polymedica  the named officers  and the board of directors believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims made against them in the actions in which they are defendants and intend to contest the claims vigorously 
although we do not consider an unfavorable outcome to the various claims probable  we cannot accurately predict their ultimate disposition  and have therefore not recorded any charges related to the outcome of these uncertainties 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we could experience significantly reduced profits as the result of an unfavorable outcome to current governmental investigations the regulations that govern medicare reimbursement are complex and our compliance with those regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies  including the department of health and human services  the doj  and the fda 
the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  is conducting investigations of alleged healthcare fraud by liberty medical and liberty home pharmacy 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating fully with the investigations 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings at this time  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to the outcome of these uncertainties 
if any of these investigations results in a determination that we have failed to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting or have otherwise committed healthcare fraud or securities law violations  we could be subject to delays or loss of reimbursement  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions 
an adverse determination could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our stock price could be volatile  which could result in substantial changes in share price the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for healthcare related companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the stock 
prices for the common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors  including variations in our financial results  changes in earnings estimates by industry research analysts  investors perceptions of us and general economic  industry and market conditions 
we plan to continue our rapid expansion  if we do not manage our growth successfully  our growth and profitability may slow or stop we have expanded our operations rapidly and plan to continue to expand 
this expansion has created significant demand on our administrative  operational and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion in existing or new markets could strain these resources and increase our need for capital 
our personnel  systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support further expansion 
the profitability of our chronic care and professional products segments will decrease if we do not receive recurring orders from customers we generally incur losses and negative cash flow with respect to the first order from a new customer for chronic care products and prescription respiratory supplies  included in our professional products segment  due primarily to the marketing and regulatory compliance costs associated with initial customer qualification 
accordingly  the profitability of these segments depends in large part on recurring and sustained reorders 
reorder rates are inherently uncertain due to several factors  many of which are outside our control  including changing customer preferences  competitive price pressures  customer transition to extended care facilities  customer mortality and general economic conditions 
we could experience significantly reduced profits from our chronic care segment if improved technologies that eliminate the need for consumable testing supplies are developed for glucose monitoring the majority of our chronic care net revenues are from consumable testing supplies  used to draw and test small quantities of blood for the purpose of measuring and monitoring glucose levels 
numerous research efforts are underway to develop more convenient and less intrusive glucose measurement techniques 
the commercialization and widespread acceptance of new technologies that eliminate or reduce the need for consumable testing supplies could negatively affect our chronic care business 
we could be liable for harm caused by products that we sell the sale of medical products entails the risk that users will make product liability claims 
a product liability claim could be expensive 
while management believes that our insurance provides adequate coverage  no assurance can be made that adequate coverage will exist for these claims 
we could lose customers and revenues to new or existing competitors who have greater financial or operating resources competition from other sellers of products offered through our chronic care  professional products and consumer healthcare segments  manufacturers of healthcare products  pharmaceutical companies and other competitors is intense and expected to increase 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are large companies with well known names and substantial resources 
these companies may develop products and services that are more effective or less expensive than any that we are developing or selling 
they may also promote and market these products more successfully than we promote and market our products 
loss of use of manufacturing or data storage facilities would significantly reduce revenues and profits from our businesses we manufacture substantially all of our prescription urology and suppository products and many of our consumer healthcare products at our facility in woburn  massachusetts 
in addition  we process and store most of our customer data in our facility in port st 
lucie  florida 
if we cannot use any of these facilities as a result of the fda  occupational safety and health administration or other regulatory action  fire  natural disaster or other event  our revenues and profits would decrease significantly 
we might also incur significant expense in remedying the problem or securing alternative manufacturing or data storage sources 
if we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable government regulations  we may be prohibited from selling our products the majority of the products that we sell are regulated by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
if any of these agencies mandate a suspension of production or sales of our products or mandate a recall  we may lose sales and incur expenses until we are in compliance with the regulations or change to another acceptable supplier 
we could have difficulty selling our consumer healthcare and professional products if we cannot maintain and expand our sales to distributors we rely on third party distributors to market and sell our consumer healthcare and prescription urology and suppository products 
our sales of these products will therefore depend in part on our maintaining and expanding marketing and distribution relationships with pharmaceutical  medical device  personal care and other distributors and on the success of those distributors in marketing and selling our products 
shortening or eliminating amortization of our direct response advertising costs could adversely affect our operating results any change in existing accounting rules or a business change that impacts expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized  currently four years for our diabetes products and two years for our prescription respiratory supplies  could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
our quarterly revenues or operating results could vary  which may cause the market price of our securities to decline we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and anticipate that such fluctuations could continue 
results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including changes in reimbursement guidelines and amounts  changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  changes in the mix or cost of our products  the timing of customer orders  the timing and cost of our advertising campaigns  and the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new products and services offered by us or our competitors 
we may make acquisitions that will strain our financial and operational resources we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses and products 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that might adversely affect our financial and operational resources  including diversion of the attention of senior management from important business matters  amortization of substantial intangible assets  difficulty in retaining key personnel of an acquired business  failure to assimilate operations of an acquired business  failure to retain the customers of an acquired business  possible operating losses and expenses of an acquired business  exposure to legal claims for activities of an acquired business prior to acquisition  and incurrence of debt and related interest expense 
we may issue preferred stock with rights senior to the common stock our articles of organization authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
the shares may have dividend  voting  liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of the common stock 
the rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board of directors in its sole discretion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own certain money market funds and mutual funds that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that the exposure to market risks in our investment portfolio is material
