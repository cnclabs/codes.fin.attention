the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  excluding any acquisition opportunities that may become available to the company 
the company intends to finance these expenditures through funds obtained from operations plus its credit facilities and possible leasing opportunities 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations

further disclosures concerning liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements on january  the sec issued fr  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec has indicated that  while it intends to consider rulemaking regarding these topics and other topics covered by the md a requirements  the purpose of its statement is to suggest steps that issuers should consider in meeting their current disclosure obligations with respect to the topics addressed 
the company is currently evaluating fr and the effects it may have  if any  on this and future filings 
the company has responded to each of the areas addressed by fr any statements in this section  which discuss or are related to future dates or periods  are forward looking statements 
fr requires management to identify any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
fr also requires management to identify any known material trends  favorable or unfavorable  in the company s capital resources including any expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources 
the company s primary source of liquidity has been cash flows 
the company s future cash flows are dependent upon  but not limited to the ability of the company to attract new and retain existing customers the number and size of the projects completed for these customers the loss of business of one or more primary customers the cancellation or delay of customer orders the changes in sales mix changes in general economic conditions and world events management s effectiveness in managing the manufacturing process the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner  amounts due the company the ability to acquire and maintain appropriate machinery and equipment acquisition or divestiture activities capital asset additions or disposals the company is dependent upon its ability to retain existing  and obtain new customers 
the company s failure to retain existing customers or obtain new customers could significantly affect future profitability of the company 
due to the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest clients have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these clients 
the loss of one or more principal clients or a change in the number or character of projects for particular clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
the timing and volume of activities can vary significantly from period to period 
there is no assurance that the volume from any particular customer will continue beyond the current period 
for example  the company s remaining fulfillment client ceased using the company s services in the first quarter of fiscal although the company will attempt to find other fulfillment clients  the termination eliminates a client that represented  in revenues in fiscal clients generally purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts  although exceptions sometimes occur when the company is required to purchase substantial inventories or special machinery to meet orders 
while the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  it is committed to developing multi year projects that can add stability to its business 
the company continues to concentrate its efforts on increasing the number of clients with long term contracts 
however  the failure of the company to add multi year projects would mean that the company would remain significantly dependent on project by project business  thus increasing the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
this would continue to make prediction of the company s future results very difficult 
even though the company is looking to increase the volume of longer term contract work  the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects accepted for certain clients 
due to the range of services that the company provides  the product sales mix can produce a range of profit margins 
some businesses in which the company operates produce lower profit margins than others 
the company believes that while there may be several competitors for individual services that it offers  few competitors offer the single source solution that the company can provide 
deteriorating or weak economic conditions  including slowdowns at both the national or local level  could affect future sales and profitability of the company 
similarly  world events can affect the company  as occurred in fiscal when  in the aftermath of september and the anthrax mailings  promotional mailings by the company s clients were significantly reduced 
technologies such as the internet will continue to affect the demand for printing services and the recent increase in postal rates will likely impact the direct mail business 
the company is not in a position to determine how it will be affected by these circumstances  how extensive the effects may be  or for how long it may be impacted by these circumstances 
management s effectiveness in managing its manufacturing processes will have a direct impact on its future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee levels  and inventory levels 
the company s ineffectiveness in managing these areas could have an effect on future profitability 
the company has had significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from its customers or other parties 
from time to time  certain of these accounts receivable or other amounts due have become unusually large and or overdue  and on occasion  the company has written off significant accounts receivable balances 
as noted above  the company is attempting to collect a note receivable through litigation 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could affect future profitability 
the general economic slowdown also increases the risk for the company as many of its clients could negatively be impacted by the economy or the financial climate 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services  and manufacture its products  therefore  the company is dependent upon the functioning of such machinery  and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment 
among other factors  the company may be affected by equipment malfunctions  training and operational needs relating to the equipment  which may delay its utilization  maintenance requirements and technological or mechanical obsolescence 
in addition  larger companies with greater capital resources may have an advantage in financing state of the art equipment 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations or expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations 
there can be no assurance that any decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations will be implemented successfully 
the company s failure to successfully implement any initiatives could affect future profitability 
from time to time  the company will sell or dispose of assets  which it feels are under performing or are no longer needed in the businesses in which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell or dispose of the assets in a manner  which is profitable to the company 
in addition  the company will make investments in assets that it feels are needed to acquire and maintain the businesses in which the company operates 
again  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire the necessary assets  or that the company can obtain a reasonable return on the investments 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements which would otherwise constitute balance sheet liabilities 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments fr encourages company s to identify obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as debt guarantees 
it is also suggested that the disclosure reference the various parts of a registrant s filings  which discuss these commitments 
the sec believes that investors would find it beneficial if aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments were provided in a single location such that a total picture of obligations would be readily available 
in addition  they had suggested the use of at least one additional aid to present the total picture of a registrant s liquidity and capital resource and the integral role of on and off balance sheet arrangements may be schedules of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the latest balance sheet date 
the company has disclosed information pertaining to these events in its report on form k 
in addition  the company has prepared schedules suggested by the sec in fr for the period ending may  the company had no commercial commitments to report as of the latest balance sheet date 
contractual less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations     disclosures about certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value the company does not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related and certain other parties as previously reported  the company has agreed to make loans to certain officers and key employees to purchase the common stock of the company 
through may   the company had loans totaling  the loans bear an interest rate of and are for a five year term 
it is the company s policy that all material transactions between the company  its officers  directors or principal shareholders  or affiliates of any of them  shall be on terms no less favorable to the company than those which could have been obtained if the transaction had been with unaffiliated third parties on an arm s length basis  and such transactions are approved by a majority of the members of the audit committee of the board of directors  or a majority of the directors who are independent and not financially interested in the transactions 
additionally  in fiscal year  the company provided some officers and other key employees with advances on expected bonus amounts  subject to year end reconciliation 
because of the rapid deterioration of general economic conditions in the second half of fiscal  final bonus amounts were substantially lower than had been expected 
in some cases  amounts advanced against fiscal bonuses were higher than actual bonus amounts 
these amounts were carried forward  and amounts have  in part  been paid by offsetting bonus payments earned during fiscal year at may    had been paid by offsetting bonus payments  the  balance has been converted into notes payable by the officer 
if the performance criteria are not met  the remaining notes are payable to the company in december as a result of legislation enacted on july   the company will no longer make loans to its officers  however  outstanding amounts at that date may continue until paid in accordance with their terms 
disclosure about critical accounting policies on december   the sec issued fr cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
fr is an intermediate step to alert companies to prepare adequate disclosure that will facilitate an understanding of the company s financial status  and the possibility  likelihood and implications of changes in its financial and operating status 
it encourages companies to aid awareness in its critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company s accounting policies are disclosed in this report on form k 
the more critical of these policies include revenue recognition and the use of estimates which inherently involve judgment and uncertainties in valuing inventory  accounts receivable and fixed assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally satisfied and the company recognizes revenue upon shipment 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company also offers certain of its customers the right to return products that do not meet the standards agreed upon 
the company continuously monitors and tracks such product returns  and while such returns have historically been minimal  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
accounts and notes receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company values accounts and notes receivable net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amounts that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
the same technique used to compute this allowance at may  has been used throughout fiscal however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
as discussed under further disclosures concerning liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements  customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
any of these  or certain additional actions  could create excess inventory levels  which would impact the valuation of inventory 
the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past 
any actions taken by the company s customers that could impact the value of inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on its forecast of product demand and production requirements 
generally  the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of its products 
if the company were not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
fixed assets and goodwill the company continues to apply the criteria established in evaluating and establishing a reserve for long lived assets determined to be impaired under statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
at may  the company had recorded an impairment reserve of  associated with certain machinery and equipment 
on june  the company adopted the provision of fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets for evaluating and establishing any reserves for intangible assets determined to be impaired 
going forward the company will need to review goodwill periodically to determine whether it has become impaired and thus must be written off 
recently issued financial accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements eliminate the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations and require that goodwill and certain intangible assets not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed for impairment annually with any related losses recognized in earnings when incurred 
the statements will be effective for the company as of june  for existing goodwill and intangible assets and for business combinations initiated after june  in july  the fasb issued fas no

this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to fas are effective for transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of this statement are effective for the company in with early application encouraged 
on july  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition of certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company is currently analyzing the impact these statements will have  however  the impact is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
other in general  the company believes that the effects of inflation on the company have not been material in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities may include forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
the company has financial instruments  consisting of notes receivable  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
however  the company does not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to limit its sensitivity to changes in interest rates because of the relatively short term nature of its notes receivable
