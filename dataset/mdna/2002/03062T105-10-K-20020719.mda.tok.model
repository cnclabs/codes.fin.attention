pretax loss for the company s discontinued operations was million for fiscal compared with a million pretax loss for fiscal the million increase in loss was principally the result of a million write down of smart choice assets  partially offset by a million credit which represents losses at smart choice in excess of the company s basis in its smart choice paaco investment 
once the company s investment in smart choice was reduced to zero  no additional losses were recorded by the company to reflect losses at smart choice 
the million write down pertains to certain smart choice assets finance receivables  property and equipment  deferred tax assets and goodwill that were deemed to be impaired in connection with the foreclosure by finova smart choice s senior lender of certain florida finance group smart choice s principal florida based operating subsidiary assets and the winding down of the florida finance group s operations see note r to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

paaco s million increase in pretax earnings was principally the result of i increased revenues and ii a lower provision for credit loss as a percentage of sales in fiscal versus in fiscal  which is believed to be attributable to a selling a higher quality vehicle  and b providing a greater level of service 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the company s statements of cash flows in thousands years ended april  operating activities income loss from continuing operations    net finance receivables growth    stock option based compensation  gain on sale of cmn  other    total   investing activities purchase of property and equipment  note collections from discontinued subsidiaries   other    total    financing activities proceeds from revolving credit facility  net    purchase of common stock    other total    cash provided by used in continuing operations   at april  the company had i million of cash on hand and had an additional million of availability on its million revolving credit facility  ii a million federal income tax refund receivable stemming principally from the company s loss on smart choice  and iii million of other receivables 
in may the company sold its interest in precision for million in cash and in july the company sold its interest in concorde for million in cash 
in addition  at closing  concorde repaid all of its million in outstanding borrowings from the company 
the majority of this cash was used to reduce debt 
on a short term basis  the company s principal sources of liquidity include i income from continuing operations  ii borrowings from its revolving credit facility  iii the sale of discontinued subsidiaries  iv a federal income tax refund receivable  and v other receivables 
on a longer term basis  the company expects its principal sources of liquidity to include i income from continuing operations  and ii borrowings from a revolving credit facility 
further  while the company has no present plans to issue debt or equity securities  the company believes  if necessary  it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities 
the company expects to use cash to i grow its finance receivables portfolio in direct proportion with the expected growth in its sales levels  ii purchase property and equipment in connection with opening new stores and refurbishing existing stores  and  to the extent excess cash is available  iii reduce debt 
over the last three fiscal years the company used approximately million in cash to purchase its common stock 
going forward  the company does not expect to purchase its common stock at this level 
the company expects to fund substantially all of its growth from income generated from operations 
further  the company expects its financial leverage ratio to decline for the next several years  as net income builds equity and debt either decreases or remains relatively constant 
the company s revolving credit facility matures in december the company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facility on or before the scheduled maturity date 
the company believes it will have adequate liquidity to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses 
below is a discussion of the company s accounting policy concerning such allowance 
other accounting policies are disclosed in note b in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level it considers sufficient to cover anticipated losses in the collection of its finance receivables 
the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon a review of i historical and recent credit losses and ii the finance receivable portfolio  and takes into consideration iii economic conditions and trends  and collateral values 
the allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations 
it is at least reasonably possible that actual credit losses may be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses 
seasonality the company s automobile sales and finance business is seasonal in nature 
in such business  the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
decreases in market interest rates could eventually have an adverse effect on profitability 
financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables and fixed and variable rate notes payable 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables have remaining maturities from one to months 
a majority of the company s borrowings contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates ie 
revolving credit facility 
however  interest rates charged on finance receivables originated in the state of arkansas are limited to the federal discount rate at april  plus 
typically  the company charges interest on its arkansas loans at or near the maximum rate allowed by law 
thus  while the interest rates charged on the company s loans do not fluctuate once established  new loans originated in arkansas are set at a spread above the federal discount rate which fluctuates 
at april  approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
assuming that this percentage is held constant for future loan originations  the long term effect of decreases in the federal discount rate could have a negative effect on profitability of the company 
this is the case because the amount of interest income lost on arkansas originated loans would likely exceed the amount of interest expense saved on the company s variable rate borrowings 
the initial impact on profitability resulting from a decrease in the federal discount rate is positive  as the immediate interest expense savings outweighs the loss of interest income on new loan originations 
however  as the amount of new loans originated at the lower interest rate exceeds the amount of variable interest rate borrowings  the effect on profitability becomes negative 
the table below illustrates the impact which hypothetical changes in the federal discount rate could have on the company s continuing pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in the federal discount rate remains in effect for two years  ii the increase or decrease in the federal discount rate results in a like increase or decrease in the rate charged on the company s variable rate borrowings  iii the principal amount of finance receivables million and variable interest rate borrowings million  and the percentage of arkansas originated finance receivables  remain constant during the periods  and iv the company s historical collection and charge off experience continues throughout the periods
