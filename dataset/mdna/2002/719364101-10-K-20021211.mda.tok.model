business combinations in september  we acquired akcron corporation  ltd  a designer and seller of automated optical inspection equipment  image processing hardware and software algorithms and high performance liquid crystal display backlight inverters for flat panel displays 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash of which we paid million at the close of the acquisition with an obligation to pay the remaining million approximately one year from the acquisition date  assumed  in liabilities and incurred  in acquisition related charges consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees 
the funds used to purchase akcron came directly out of our working capital 
in july  we purchased certain assets from art advanced research technologies inc  or art  for approximately million in cash and assumed certain liabilities of  related to art s infrared 
table of contents screening and inspection solutions division  or isis 
we incurred  in acquisition related charges consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees 
the funds used to purchase the assets of art came directly out of our working capital 
the art assets acquired  including personnel  technology and inventory  were used by art in the design  manufacture and sale of the isis infrared verification systems 
in july  we acquired intelligent reasoning systems  inc  or irsi  a designer and seller of automated optical inspection systems based on its proprietary adaptive knowledge based technology 
in connection with the acquisition we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at million at closing  made payments of approximately million related to costs of the transaction consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  assumed a warrant  with a fair value of  which upon closing of the acquisition and pursuant to the terms therein  became exercisable for  shares of our common stock  and assumed million in liabilities 
in december  we acquired all of the capital stock of photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc  or ips  in exchange for  shares of our common stock with the acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests

under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we paid million in cash for certain assets and assumed certain liabilities related to intevac s rapid thermal processing division 
impact of staff accounting bulletin number sab our fiscal financial statements reflect our adoption of sab in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab the sec addressed several issues in sab  including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur after shipment and transfer of title 
our previous revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue at the time the customer takes title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
in october  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  which clarifies many of the implementation questions surrounding sab we changed our revenue recognition policy effective october  based on guidance provided in sab we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from the following sources equipment sales and spare part sales 
certain of our product sales of our flat panel display and cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with the specific type of equipment  we recognize revenue for a portion of the total contract price due and billable upon shipment  
table of contents with the remainder recognized after installation and acceptance 
all other product sales with customer acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue from the sale of our printed circuit board assembly products is generally recognized upon shipment  as such product sales are not subject to customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from the sale of spare parts is recognized upon shipment 
the adoption of sab had no impact on the revenue recognition policy for the sale of spare parts or printed circuit board assembly products 
we have reported this change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  or apb  as a cumulative effect adjustment 
because we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal  no cumulative effect of the change is included in net income in the fourth quarter 
instead  apb requires that the change be made as of the beginning of the year and that financial information for interim periods of fiscal reported prior to the change  be restated by applying sab to those periods 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  we recorded a non cash charge of million  or per share in fiscal  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal the decrease to operating results before the cumulative effect of the accounting change as a result of the adoption of sab amounted to million or per diluted share for fiscal the deferred revenue balance as of october  was million 
this amount is comprised of final holdback amounts of to on equipment that was shipped for which final installation and acceptance had not occurred as of october  of these amounts  we recognized million and million as revenue in the fiscal years and  respectively  which decreased net loss by million and million in the fiscal years and  respectively 
as of september   the remaining deferred revenue balance was approximately  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  purchase order commitments  warranty obligations  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we changed our revenue recognition policy effective october  based on guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we account for certain product sales in the flat panel display and cathode ray tube display and high quality glass inspection product segments as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with the specific type of equipment  we recognize revenue for a portion of the total 
table of contents contract price due and billable upon shipment  with the remainder recognized when it becomes due generally upon acceptance 
we recognize all other product sales with the customer acceptance provisions upon customer acceptance 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of our printed circuit board assembly products upon shipment  as such product sales are not subject to customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue from the sale of spare parts upon shipment 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenue is recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  additional provisions may be required 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on historical data  the length of time the receivables are past due and other known factors 
if a single customer returned a product or was unable or unwilling to make payments  additional allowances may be required as certain of our products have selling prices in excess of million per unit 
accordingly  a single customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using currently adjusted standards which approximates actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the recoverability of all inventory and purchase commitments to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
we make purchase commitments for inventory based upon existing backlog and sales forecasts 
to mitigate supply constraints and to fulfill orders for non standard configurations  we maintain certain inventory levels especially for parts with long lead times 
inventory which is obsolete defined as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process or in excess of the forecasted usage is written down to its estimated market value based on projected demand  historical usage and other known factors 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty obligations our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a period of one year from final acceptance 
we record the estimated cost of warranty coverage  primarily material and labor to repair and service the equipment  upon product shipment 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
goodwill we have accounted for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
fas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the process for evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our fiscal financial statements  we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of this reporting unit 
our cashflow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
we also considered our market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to the recorded amount of goodwill could be reported 

table of contents long lived assets and intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives and other long lived assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to evaluation for impairment 
we review long lived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
restructuring costs we account for restructuring costs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and related abandonment of excess equipment and facilities 
actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies and litigation we make an assessment of the probability of an adverse judgment resulting from current and threatened litigation 
we accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if  in our estimation  the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of such litigation 
we have made no such accruals at september  
table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended september   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain items in our consolidated statement of operations

revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal sales of flat panel display products represented million  million and million  or  and of our revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in flat panel display revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to customer expansion of manufacturing capacity 
the decrease in flat panel display revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the general economic slowdown resulting in reduced capital spending by flat panel display manufacturers and to a lesser extent  the impact of the application of sab in fiscal sales of our printed circuit board assembly products represented million  million and million  or  and of our revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from printed circuit board assembly products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the general economic slowdown resulting in decreased capital spending by printed circuit board manufacturers  and decreases in the average selling prices of these products 
revenue from printed circuit board assembly products was unchanged in fiscal as compared to fiscal as reduced sales in x ray systems due to competitive pressures were offset by sales of next generation optical inspection systems 
sales of our cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of flat panel displays continuing to replace cathode ray tube displays  resulting in a decrease in capital spending by cathode ray tube manufacturers 
the increase in revenue 
table of contents from cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to increased sales of cathode ray tube display products 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal from gross margin of in fiscal the overall increase in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of increased manufacturing efficiencies attributable to higher sales volumes of flat panel display products and favorable product mix  offset in part by lower gross margins in the other two product segments due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from decreased revenue and lower manufacturing volumes  combined with lower average selling prices for printed circuit board assembly products 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the decrease in revenue and lower manufacturing volumes of flat panel display products 
gross margin from flat panel display products increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margin from flat panel display products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the change in gross margin was largely related to higher capacity utilization in fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin from printed circuit board assembly products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin from printed circuit board assembly products in fiscal from fiscal was the result of lower sales and manufacturing volumes  resulting in under absorption of manufacturing overhead  combined with lower average selling prices 
the decrease in gross margin from printed circuit board assembly products in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures on our x ray inspection systems 
gross margin from cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margins from cathode ray tube and high quality glass products in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes  resulting in under absorption of manufacturing overhead  combined with a less favorable sales mix 
the decrease in gross margin from cathode ray tube display and high quality glass products in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a less favorable sales mix with increased sales of products with lower gross margins 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  depreciation  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs  patent filing costs and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  all of which relate to the design  development  testing  pre manufacturing and significant improvement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of our revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher salaries and related expenses incurred after our acquisition of irsi in july the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our investment in personnel  consultants and prototype materials for the development of our next generation arraychecker and arraysaver products 
also  in fiscal  we started work on our new cell and module inspection system 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions and related expenses for executive  sales  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and of our revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal year  higher selling  general and administrative expenses related to our acquisition of irsi in july were offset by reduced headcount and other expenses resulting from the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to increased labor and related expenses after the acquisition of irsi 

table of contents goodwill impairment 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas and fas  respectively 
fas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  it also changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill 
fas requires goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized  however these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
accordingly  as a result of the continued economic slowdown in the electronics industry  we performed an impairment analysis of the million of goodwill associated with the printed circuit board assembly reporting unit  stemming from our acquisition of irsi in july the valuation was done as of july   using established valuation techniques  specifically  the income and market approaches 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million 
write off of purchased intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  fas we perform tests for impairment of our long lived assets  including intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that such assets may be impaired 
fas requires us to assess whether the carrying value  the un amortized portion of the purchased intangible assets  is greater than the fair value  which is determined based on discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the continued economic slowdown in the electronics industry  we performed an impairment analysis of purchased intangible assets associated with the printed circuit board assembly reporting unit  acquired as part of our acquisition of irsi in july as a result  we recorded a write off of million related to the acquired developed technology 
restructure charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million associated with a reduction in workforce  consolidation and closing of facilities and write off of related fixed assets 
the restructuring was primarily related to the printed circuit board assembly business segment and related sales and service functions 
the charge is comprised of approximately  for employee severance and related benefits as a result of terminating employees  million related to excess facilities and  of abandoned assets with no future economic benefit 
the charge for excess facilities relates to rent obligations under long term operating lease agreements for facilities we will vacate which are to be paid in cash through december under the restructuring plan  we expect approximately million dollars in annual cost savings  however we cannot ensure that such savings will materialize 
we expect to settle all employee severance and related benefits by the end of our second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with a reduction in workforce of employees and a reorganization of our divisions 
these charges were the result of several initiatives  including  the completion of the integration of irsi into our printed circuit board assembly division  establishment of a sales and service organization and downsizing our capacity to current shipment levels 
as of september  the remaining liability associated with this restructuring plan is approximately  which represents contractual payments to be paid to a former executive through march acquired in process research and development 
in july and september  we completed our acquisition of certain assets from art advanced research technologies related to art s infrared screening and inspection solutions division and our acquisition of akcron corporation  respectively 
the purchase price for each has been allocated in accordance with fas the resulting in process research and development charges were  for the isis acquisition and  for the akcron acquisition 
in july  we completed the acquisition of irsi for which the in process research and development charge was million 

table of contents such amounts were expensed on the acquisition date as they represent ongoing research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
acquired in process research and development was identified and valued through interviews with acquired company executives  analysis of data concerning developmental products and their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete the projects  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing in process research and development 
projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of  which was determined after consideration of our weighted average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
as such  the timing of completion and ultimate commercial application are affected by the successful completion of these activities and ultimately  market acceptance 
amortization of intangibles the identified intangible assets other than goodwill related to the isis  akcron and irsi acquisitions are being amortized over a two to five year period  commencing on the date of the acquisitions 
we have recorded related amortization expense of million and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
remaining intangibles assets of approximately million at september  will be amortized over varying periods ranging from to years 
non recurring acquisition charges 
in december  we acquired all the capital stock of ips in a pooling of interests transaction  in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock 
we incurred million in professional fees consisting of legal  accounting and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of ips 
in november  we acquired all the capital stock of cr technology  inc in a pooling of interests transaction  in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock 
in connection with this acquisition we incurred  in professional fees consisting of legal  accounting and investment banking fees 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income and other  net in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower overall yields on investments as compared to fiscal  partially offset by the impact of higher cash balances in fiscal resulting from the net proceeds of the underwritten public offering of our common stock in february the increase in interest income and other  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher average cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the fiscal  and effective tax rates were  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in fiscal is less than the statutory federal income tax rate as a result of an election reducing our tax benefits arising from acquired net operating losses and increasing tax bases in various purchased intangible assets 
the effective tax rate in fiscal years and is lower than the statutory rate due to tax benefits arising from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth primarily by a combination of cash flows from operations  public stock offerings  lines of credit and loans 
working capital was million as of september  compared to 
table of contents million as of september  a major component of working capital is million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of september  compared to million as of september  operating activities 
cash used in operating activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  while cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal the increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increased loss from operations  excluding the goodwill impairment charge and intangible asset write off  and the increase in accounts receivable and other current assets  which was offset in part by the goodwill impairment charge  intangible asset write off and the increase in accounts payable 
the increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increased loss from operations and the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
this was offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable due to reduced sales 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  and cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due largely to the purchase of short term investments with the cash provided by our public offering of shares of our common stock 
additionally  we used cash of million and million in the acquisitions of isis and akcron  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to the liquidation of investments to fund the purchase of a new building for our corporate headquarters and the acquisition of irsi 
in july  we completed the acquisition of irsi in which we issued shares of our common stock and paid approximately million in cash for assumed liabilities million paid as of the date of the acquisition and million paid after the date of the acquisition 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures decreased in fiscal due to a reduction in our capital spending as a result of a slowdown in our business 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily for the purchase of the new building for million and other equipment to support our operations 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to our public offerings of shares of our common stock 
in february   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
additionally  the underwriters in the offering exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares to cover over allotments 
our net proceeds after the underwriters discount and expenses of the offering  aggregated approximately million 
the cash provided by the public offering of shares was partially offset by million of repurchases of our common stock in the open market in fiscal in february  we made a public offering related to  shares of our common stock  of which we sold approximately  shares  and one of our shareholders sold approximately  shares 
we received additional proceeds as a result of the underwriters exercising their over allotment option 
in aggregate  we received proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs  from the offering 
in march  we entered into a bank line of credit line of credit which had an initial term of one year 
we have renegotiated the line of credit on an annual basis and currently have a million borrowing capacity on the line of credit  expiring in april the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 
in august  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
the repurchases are made from time to time on the open market at prevailing prices  in negotiated transactions off the market or pursuant to a b plan adopted by us 
the b plan  allows us to repurchase our shares during a period in which we are in possession of 
table of contents material non public information  provided that we communicated share repurchase instructions to the broker at a time when we were not in possession of such material non public information 
as of november  we have repurchased  shares for an aggregate of approximately million 
the following table summarizes the approximate contractual obligations that we have at september  such obligations include both non cancelable obligations and other obligations that are generally non cancelable except under certain limited conditions 
payments due by period contract obligations total less than year years after years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total the table above includes purchase orders that we have placed with sanmina sci under the terms of our agreement which requires us to place orders covering a minimum period of days 
on october   we completed the purchase of certain assets from intevac  inc  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between intevac and us 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we paid million in cash for certain assets and assumed certain liabilities related to intevac s rapid thermal processing business 
the funds used to purchase the assets of intevac came directly out of our working capital 
we believe that existing liquid capital resources and funds generated from operations combined with the ability  if necessary  to borrow up to million under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise 
we may  from time to time  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies and may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and if we were to proceed with acquisitions without this funding or with limited funding it would decrease our capital resources 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
impact of accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 impairment of long lived assets  or fas fas supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or fas fas retains the requirements of fas to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
fas removes goodwill from its scope 
fas is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or for our fiscal year ended september  we do not expect the adoption to have any material adverse impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to the timing 
table of contents of the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf is to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the effect of adoption of fas is dependent on our related activities subsequent to the date of adoption 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached as consensus on issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the eitf concluded that revenue arrangements with multiple elements should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement have value to the customer on a standalone basis  if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and as long as there are no rights of return or additional performance guarantees by the company 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
are applicable to agreements entered into after june  management is currently determining what effect  if any  the provisions of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others

will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
factors affecting operating results we have recently sustained losses and we may not be able to return to profitability 
we reported a decrease in revenue for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september   and a decrease in revenue for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  we reported losses for the fiscal years ended september  and in the future  our revenue may decline  remain flat or grow at a rate slower than expected  especially in light of the recent economic slowdown 
our ability to regain profitability on an annual basis is dependent in part on our customers recovery from this slowdown and the success of our efforts to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue through our outsourcing strategy and ongoing cost cutting measures in connection with our recent restructuring 
in addition  if we determine that the goodwill in any of our reporting segments has been impaired  we would decrease the carrying value of the goodwill  which would decrease our net income  or increase our net loss  during the period in which we determined that the asset was impaired 
in the fourth quarter ended fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
additionally  we wrote off million related to the un amortized portion of the acquired developed technology intangible asset 
our operating results are difficult to predict  as described below  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving increased revenue  positive cash flows or profitability 
capital investment by manufacturers of flat panel display products and other electronics products can be highly cyclical and may decline in the future 
our business depends in large part on capital expenditures by manufacturers of flat panel display products and other electronics products  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for the end products in these industries 
the markets for flat panel display products and other electronics products are highly cyclical and have experienced periods of oversupply resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
for example  the flat panel display industry experienced a downturn in  which led many flat 
table of contents panel display manufacturers to delay or cancel capital expenditures 
additionally  in  due to the general deteriorating economic environment  flat panel display and electronics manufacturers reduced capital expenditures resulting in a decrease in revenue for all segments of our business 
in  capital expenditures by manufacturers in the electronics industry continue to remain low  which has resulted in decreased revenue for our electronics products as compared to the prior year 
although flat panel display revenue increased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the prior year  this was not enough to offset the decline in revenue from our other product segments 
if the flat panel display and other markets in which we sell our products do not recover sufficiently or experience further slowdowns in the future  it could cause our revenue to decrease significantly 
in addition  the need to invest in the engineering  research and development  and marketing required to penetrate targeted foreign markets and maintain extensive service and support capabilities limits our ability to reduce expenses during these downturns 
we depend on sales to a few large customers in the flat panel display industry  and if we lose any of our large customers our revenue could decrease significantly 
the flat panel display industry is extremely concentrated with a small number of manufacturers producing the majority of the world s flat panel displays 
if one or more of our major customers ceased or significantly curtailed their purchases  our revenue could drop significantly and we may be unable to replace sales to these customers 
sales of flat panel display products represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of flat panel display products to lg phillips lcd co  ltd 
represented of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  lg phillips lcd co  ltd  unipac optoelectronics corporation and ishikawajima harima heavy industries co  ltd  or ihi  all customers of our flat panel display products  collectively accounted for of our total revenue  in fiscal and collectively for of our revenue from sales of flat panel display products in fiscal our operating results are difficult to predict and may vary from investors expectations  which could cause our stock price to drop 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
consequently  past financial results may not be indicative of future financial results 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a small number of yield management systems ranging in price from approximately  to million 
therefore  the timing of the sale of a single system could have a significant impact on our quarterly results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
therefore  our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not necessarily determine actual sales for the quarter or any succeeding period 
other factors which may influence our operating results in a particular quarter include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  our product mix  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to obtain components from our single or limited source suppliers in a timely manner  continued or worsened financial markets or economic instability in asia or the world in general  the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  any write down in the value of acquired goodwill in the event that we determine that the goodwill has been impaired  our ability to design  manufacture and introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis  the delay between expenses to further develop marketing and service capabilities and the realization of benefits from those improved capabilities  and 
table of contents the introduction of new products by our competitors 
if we experience difficulties in any of these areas  our operating results could be significantly and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
in addition  it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
if we are not able to obtain critical components from our single or limited source suppliers  we may experience significant delays in producing our products  which could decrease our revenue for an extended period of time 
we obtain some equipment for our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  we currently obtain materials handling platforms  ultra high resolution cameras and high speed image processing systems for our flat panel display products from single source suppliers 
we also currently obtain x ray equipment for our printed circuit board assembly inspection products from limited source suppliers 
although we seek to reduce dependence on our sole and limited source suppliers  alternative sources of supply for this equipment may not be available or may be available on unfavorable terms 
the partial or complete loss of our sole and limited source suppliers could at least temporarily delay our shipments or otherwise harm our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these pieces of equipment could harm our results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to companies located outside the united states  which exposes us to risks that we do not experience with domestic sales 
sales to countries other than the united states accounted for  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect sales to foreign countries to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue 
a number of factors may adversely affect our international sales and operations  including imposition of governmental controls  fluctuations in the united states dollar  which could increase the foreign sales prices of our products in local currencies  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  limited foreign protection of intellectual property rights  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
if any of these factors occur  our operating results and revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
we rely upon sales of a limited range of products  and if demand for one product decreases for any reason it could cause our revenue to decline significantly 
a substantial percentage of our revenue has come from a limited range of products for the flat panel display and printed circuit board assembly industries 
we expect that these products will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenue 
any decline in demand for  or failure to achieve continued market acceptance of  our primary products or any new version of these products could harm our business 
we currently 
table of contents market two primary products for the flat panel display industry  our array test and array repair equipment 
for the printed circuit board assembly industry  our primary products include our x ray and optical inspection systems 
revenue from these four products represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
continued market acceptance of these primary products is critical to our success 
we may have difficulty integrating the businesses we recently acquired or other businesses or assets we may acquire in the future  and we may not realize the benefits that we expect from these acquisitions 
we have recently acquired several companies  including cr technology  inc in november  image processing systems in december  intelligent reasoning systems  inc in july  akcron corporation  ltd in september  as well as certain assets from art advanced research technologies inc in july and certain assets from intevac  inc in october we may acquire other assets or companies in the future 
integrating businesses can be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
if we are not able to do so effectively  we will not be able to realize the benefits that we expect to receive from acquisitions 
for each acquisition  we must integrate separate technologies  product lines  business cultures and practices  employees and systems 
acquisitions are subject to numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the technologies and products of the acquired company  entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  loss of key customers of the acquired company  diversion of management resources from the business of the combined company  incompatibility of business cultures or practices  loss of key employees of the acquired company  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  potential inefficiencies in delivering services to the customers of the combined company  and assumption of unknown or undisclosed liabilities 
any of these difficulties could increase our operating costs and harm our financial performance 
future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets  which could harm our profitability 
any failure of  or other problems at or with  sanmina sci corporation or other third party manufacturers could delay shipments of our flat panel display or surface mount technology products  harm our relationships with our customers or otherwise negatively impact our business 
if sanmina sci corporation or any other third party that we use to manufacture our products is unable to satisfy our quality requirements or provide us with the products and services in a timely manner  our shipments of these products may be delayed  our customer relationships may be harmed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in addition  we are in the process of transferring most of the manufacturing operations of our flat panel display and printed circuit board assembly optical inspection and x ray products to sanmina sci 
during this transition period  we may encounter significant unforeseen expenses and difficulties due to reasons that may be beyond our control  including technology and personnel incompatibility 
these unforeseen expenses and difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business and distract management and employees 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with sanmina sci or any other third party that we use to manufacture our products will result in a reduction of our expenses or enable us to satisfy our customers quality requirements or to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner 

table of contents if we do not compete effectively in our target markets  we will lose market share 
the markets for yield management systems in the flat panel display  printed circuit board assembly  cathode ray tube display  cathode ray tube glass  and automotive glass industries are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors that have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources than us and have larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may force price reductions that could harm our results of operations 
our customers may also develop technology and equipment that may reduce or eliminate their need to purchase our products 
although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining and capitalizing on these advantages will require us to continue a high level of investment in engineering  research and development  marketing and customer service support 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive advantages 
we depend on our relationship with ihi to sell our flat panel display products in japan  and if we are not able to maintain this relationship  we may not be able to access this important market 
we believe that japanese companies competing with us in sales to the flat panel display industry have a competitive advantage in japan because of the preference of some local customers for local equipment suppliers 
historically  foreign companies have found it difficult to penetrate the japanese market and often depend upon local sales channels to sell their products in japan 
since june  we have depended on ihi as our exclusive distributor to sell our flat panel display products in japan 
we anticipate that this relationship will continue in the future 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal   and of our total revenue came from sales to ihi  respectively 
if ihi reduced the resources allocated to the sale and support of our flat panel display products in japan  our business would be harmed 
in addition  ihi s rights to continue as our exclusive distributor in japan are currently unresolved 
ihi may have the right to market some or all of our products in japan on an exclusive basis  even exclusive as to us 
if so  we may not be able to compete effectively in japan 
although ihi must purchase certain critical components from us  ihi may manufacture competing array test systems based on our technology 
if this occurs  our business could be harmed 
we have granted ihi the non exclusive right to manufacture and sell array test systems based on our technology  excluding technology incorporated into some critical components  in korea  taiwan and several other countries 
although ihi has neither manufactured these products  nor sold these products in countries other than japan  our business could be harmed if ihi manufactures and sells array test systems in competition with our own in these countries 
if our products experience performance  reliability or quality problems  our customers may reduce their orders 
we believe that future orders of our products will depend in part on our ability to satisfy the performance  reliability and quality standards required by our customers 
particularly as customers seek increased yields  greater throughput and higher quality end products  we must continually redesign our products to meet the needs of our customers 
if our products have performance  reliability or quality problems  then we may experience delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders  additional warranty and service expenses  and higher manufacturing costs 

table of contents if we are unable to meet the requirements of our customers  our revenue may decrease and our business could be harmed 
our success depends in large part on the strength of the active matrix liquid crystal display in the flat panel display industry 
while our technology is applicable to other flat panel display technologies  our experience has been focused on applications for active matrix liquid crystal displays  the most prevalent and one of the highest performance flat panel displays available today 
in fiscal and fiscal  we derived approximately and of our revenue from sales of flat panel display products  substantially all of which were based on the active matrix liquid crystal display technology 
an industry shift away from active matrix liquid crystal display technology to existing or new competing technologies could reduce the demand for our existing products and require significant expenditures to develop new products  each of which could harm our business 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products that respond to evolving industry requirements in a timely manner  which could reduce our ability to compete effectively 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our competitive position and results of operations 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products 
for example  the size of glass plates for flat panel displays and the resolution of flat panel displays have changed frequently and may continue to change  requiring us to redesign or reconfigure our flat panel display products 
similarly  as the technologies for products in the printed circuit board assembly and cathode ray tube display and high quality glass industries continue to become more complex  we will be forced to continually refine our product offerings 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to timely develop and introduce new products and enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products will develop sufficiently 
we depend on close relationships with our customers and the willingness of those customers to share information with us  and the failure to do so could harm our development efforts 
our business could be harmed if we fail to properly protect our intellectual property 
our success depends largely on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights and trade secrets in the united states and other countries  there can be no assurance that we will successfully protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
we cannot assure you that the claims allowed on any patents held by us will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology against competition from third parties with similar technologies or products 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we could experience various obstacles and high costs in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign countries 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
we have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees 
it is possible that these agreements may be breached and that the available remedies for any breach will not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred 

table of contents litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend against claims of intellectual property infringement  which could be expensive and  if we lose  could prevent us from selling our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  could be costly and require significant time and attention of key members of our management and technical personnel 
our domestic and international competitors  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties 
third parties may assert infringement claims  successful or otherwise  against us  and litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease selling our products 
even successful defenses of patent suits can be costly and time consuming 
we must attract and retain key employees to maintain and grow our business 
our future success depends in part on our ability to retain key personnel  particularly senior management and engineers 
we also need to attract additional skilled personnel in significant areas of our business to grow 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
because we rely on our sales representatives and distributors  our business may be harmed if our sales representatives become unable or unwilling to sell our products 
we market and sell some of our products  such as our printed circuit board assembly products  domestically and internationally primarily through sales representatives and distributors 
if some or all of our sales representatives and distributors experience financial difficulties  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business could be harmed 
these sales representatives and distributors could reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to us 
in addition  we depend upon the continued viability and financial resources of these representatives and distributors  many of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
these representatives and distributors  in turn  depend substantially on general economic conditions and other factors affecting the markets for the products they sell 
we believe that our success will continue to depend upon these sales representatives and distributors 
we may experience unanticipated warranty claims 
we typically provide a limited warranty on our products for a period of one year from final acceptance by customers 
we may incur substantial warranty claim expenses on our products and actual warranty claims may exceed recorded allowances  resulting in harm to our business 
earthquakes may damage our facilities 
our corporate and manufacturing facilities in california are located near major earthquake faults which have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in addition  some of our customers in asia are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster in or near the san francisco bay area or southern california  our facilities may sustain significant damage and our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake in asia  like the one that occurred in taiwan in september  could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers  which could reduce demand for our products 

table of contents our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors  such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors  government regulations  developments in patent or other property rights  and developments in our relationships with our customers 
in addition  the stock market has in recent years experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
broad market fluctuations  general economic condition and specific conditions in the flat panel display  printed circuit board assembly and cathode ray tube display and high quality glass industries may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the board also has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of our shareholders will be subject to  and may be impaired by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
these and other provisions contained in our charter documents and applicable provisions of california law could serve to depress our stock price or discourage a hostile bid in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise effect a change in control of us 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have also agreed not to pay cash dividends under our current bank line of credit 
instead  we intend to apply any earnings to the expansion and development of our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the operating results of our foreign affiliates 
actual changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
the potential impact depends upon the magnitude of the rate change 
we believe our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for our cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable is immaterial as substantially all of our cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable are denominated in us dollars 
we currently do not use derivative financial investments to hedge our current foreign exchange exposure 
market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our exposure to market risk relates primarily to interest rate fluctuations in connection with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
we enter into financial instruments for non trading purposes and do not have derivative financial instruments in our portfolio
