as the use of digital photography and digital video cameras grow  we believe creative professionals throughout the world will continue to require software solutions to edit  enhance  and manage their digital photographs and digital videos 
we also believe business and hobbyist users will need digital imaging and digital video software as more people utilize digital cameras and digital camcorders

the mid range consumer digital imaging software market is characterized by intense competition  price sensitivity  brand awareness  and strength in retail distribution 
we face direct and indirect competition in this market from a number of companies  including jasc software  roxio formerly mgi software  microsoft  and ulead systems

the professional digital imaging software market is characterized by feature rich competition  brand awareness  and price sensitivity 
we face direct and indirect competition in this market from a number of companies  including jasc software and macromedia 
we believe that we lead in market share and compete favorably with our adobe photoshop product due to high awareness of the adobe photoshop brand in digital imaging  our strong relationships with market influencers  the features and technical capabilities of the product  and our ability to leverage core features from our other established products 
the dynamic media software market is an increasingly competitive market as professional  enthusiast  and home users migrate away from analog video tools towards the use of digital camcorders and digital video production 
adobe after effects and adobe premiere face increased competition from companies such as apple computer  autodesk  eyeon  pinnacle  in sync corporation  media  roxio formerly mgi software  avid  sonic foundry  and ulead systems 
in the professional compositing and special effects editing market  we believe that we lead in market share with adobe after effects and compete favorably in this market due to our strong feature set and the integration with our other products to create a broad platform for our customers 
in the professional digital video editing market we believe that we lead in market share with adobe premiere on the microsoft windows platform  and compete favorably in this market due to our strong feature set  our oem relationships  and the integration with our other products to create a broad platform for our customers 
in the professional digital video editing market on the macintosh platform  we believe we trail in market share to apple computer s digital video editing product

the drawing and illustration market is characterized by feature rich competition  brand awareness  and price sensitivity 
adobe illustrator faces competition from companies such as corel and macromedia 
we believe that we lead in market share and compete favorably with our product in this market due to high awareness of the features in our illustrator product  especially the drawing and illustration functionalities  our strong relationships with market influencers  the features and technical capabilities of the product  and our ability to leverage core technologies from our other established products

these companies include corel  macromedia  and roxio 
cross media publishing in the cross media publishing market  we offer several products including adobe golive  adobe indesign  adobe pagemaker  adobe framemaker  and adobe type library

in addition  the products increasingly work well together  providing broader functionality and shortened product learning time for the individual who uses multiple applications to complete a project 
the web page layout market is a constantly evolving and highly volatile market that has been impacted by both the recent global economic downturn and the reduction in web product spending 
we believe adobe golive trails in market share and faces significant direct and indirect competition in the web page layout market from companies such as macromedia and microsoft 
although we believe we compete favorably with our product due to the features of adobe golive and our ability to leverage core technologies from our other established products  we believe it will be difficult to take market share away from competitive products in the market due to the entrenched nature of macromedia s dreamweaver product within web design and consultancy businesses  the broad distribution and use of microsoft s frontpage as a mid range web page layout solution  and the global economic impact on web based business in our adobe indesign product faces tough competition in the professional page layout market 
the main competitor product  quark xpress  has a leading market share in the roman language markets for professional page layout in the united states and europe 
quark xpress also benefits from an established industry infrastructure that has been built around the use of the xpress product in print shops and service bureaus  and through the development of third party plug in products 
barriers to the adoption of adobe indesign by quark xpress customers include this infrastructure  as well as the cost of conversion  training  and software hardware procurement required in a switch to indesign 
we believe we can gain market share with indesign software against xpress due to our strong brand name  our support of apple s new mac os x operating system  new product capabilities  and the recently improved infrastructure support by the industry for our solution 
adobe recently made available version of indesign  which will compete against the new version of quark xpress  version in the technical authoring and publishing market  adobe framemaker products face competition from large scale electronic publishing systems developed by several companies as listed below

these companies include broadvision  macromedia  microsoft  quark  and arbortext 
epaper solutions in electronic document delivery  exchange  collaboration  and archive markets  the electronic forms market  and the pdf file creation market  our adobe epaper product family faces competition from entrenched office applications and increased competition from new emerging products and technologies 
current office applications and internet content creation management tools that use microsoft word  xml  html  and tagged information file format tiff file formats compete with adobe pdf and adobe s epaper product family 
in addition  microsoft s new office xp suite targets business users that want improved collaborative document review  scanning optical character recognition ocr  and security capabilities  in competition with similar features offered by adobe s epaper products family

in the area of electronic forms solutions  we face competition from cardiff and microsoft  as well as from accelio formerly jetform unless and until our proposed acquisition of accelio is consummated

looking to the future  electronic document systems targeting enterprises that utilize emerging standards such as xml and microsoft s 
net initiative are being developed and will likely be adopted 
adobe is working to ensure that compatibility and or migration plans exist between these formats platforms and the adobe pdf format  as well as our acrobat software products and other adobe applications

we believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency  oem customer relationships  and intellectual property portfolio 
adobe postscript and adobe extreme software face competition from hewlett packard s proprietary pcl page description language and from developers of page description languages based on the postscript language standard  including global graphics formerly called harlequin and xionics

product protection we regard our software as proprietary and protect it with copyrights  patents  trademarks  trade secret laws  internal and external nondisclosure precautions  and restrictions on disclosure and transferability that are incorporated into our software license agreements 
we protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets  and make source code available to oems only under limited circumstances and specific security and confidentiality constraints

we also rely on copyright laws and on shrink wrap and electronic licenses that are not signed by the end user 
copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries 
the enforceability of shrink wrap and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined 
we have obtained many patents and have registered numerous copyrights  trademarks  domain names  and logos in the united states and foreign countries 
policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult  and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry 
this problem is particularly acute in international markets 
we conduct vigorous anti piracy programs 
however  our products do not currently contain copy protection or network copy detection features 
we believe that  because computer software technology changes and develops rapidly  patent  trade secret  and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of our personnel  brand recognition  contractual relationships  and ongoing product development

revenue change change revenue    revenue is categorized into four major operating segments web publishing  cross media publishing  epaper solutions  and oem postscript and other 
the web publishing  cross media publishing  and epaper solutions segments include application products revenue that is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail  var  and oem distribution channels  as well as direct to end users through adobe call centers and our web site 
the oem postscript and other segment includes licensing revenue  which is made up of royalties received from oem customers who ship products containing adobe s postscript technology 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we have realigned our business segments 
a newly named graphics segment will in the future replace the former web publishing segment and will include revenues and direct expenses related to adobe illustrator 
the adobe golive and web collection products will be reported in the cross media publishing segment 
the management s discussion and analysis that follows is based on our old segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal   and for more information on both our old and new segment reporting  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue from our web publishing segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products photoshop  adobe premiere  photoshop elements  web collection  after effects  altercast  golive  digital video collection  adobe photodeluxe  streamline  atmosphere  adobe dimensions  adobe viewer  and livemotion 
cross media publishing revenue comes primarily from the licensing of the following application products illustrator  design collection  adobe publishing collection  pagemaker  framemaker  adobe type products  indesign  adobe acrobat inproduction  adobe content server  adobe pdf transit  adobe studio  ebooks  and pressready 
the epaper solutions segment is derived from the licensing of adobe acrobat software and other acrobat related technologies 
during fiscal  overall revenue decreased  or million  compared to fiscal  primarily due to adverse economic conditions  especially in the us  and a decline in revenue from our web publishing  cross media publishing  and oem postscript and other segments 
revenue from our web publishing segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue from this segment was primarily due to severe economic pressure on the creative publishing professional market  which resulted in a decline in revenue from our photoshop product 
also contributing to the decrease in revenue in this segment in fiscal compared to fiscal were the following factors decreased revenue from our golive and web collection products  due to declines in the web layout and web animation products market  decreased revenue from our photodeluxe product due to product lifecycle timing  and decreased revenue from our livemotion product due to competitive factors and product lifecycle timing 
our after effects product also experienced a decline in revenue despite its new version release in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in revenue in this segment was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the following products photoshop elements  which was first released in april of fiscal  digital video collection  due to the growth of the digital video market  and adobe premiere  due to the new version release of adobe premiere in january revenue from our cross media publishing segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was partially due to a decline in revenue from our illustrator and publishing collections products throughout fiscal year due to product lifecycle timings  which more than offset the revenue from their new version releases in the fourth quarter of fiscal there were also decreases in revenue from our framemaker and indesign products  due to product lifecycle timing  and our type product  due to decreased marketing activities 
lastly  we experienced a decline in revenue from our pagemaker product in the first half of fiscal  which more than offset the revenue from the new version release of pagemaker in the third quarter of fiscal the decrease in revenue from this segment was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our adobe design collection product due to increased marketing and promotional activities throughout the year 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the following factors continued weakness in the print business  customer transition from paper based processes to electronic workflows  renegotiated pricing with certain oem customers  and the outsourcing of certain oem accounts to a third party solution provider 
the decrease in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase of  or million  in our epaper solutions segment  as it increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the release of acrobat in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as the continuing movement from paper based processes to electronic workflows adopted by enterprises and government agencies 
during fiscal  overall revenue increased compared to fiscal  driven primarily by increased licensing of products in our web publishing  epaper solutions  and cross media publishing segments 
our web publishing segment provided the majority of the revenue growth in fiscal  as it grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from this segment was primarily driven by the strength of our photoshop product during the first three quarters of fiscal and the release of our photoshop product in the fourth quarter of fiscal also contributing to the growth in this segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the increased revenue from our web and dynamic media collection products  which were first introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increased licensing of our livemotion  adobe premiere  after effects  golive  and activeshare products 
the increase in revenue in this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our pagemill and photodeluxe products  due to product lifecycle timing and reduced pricing 
revenue from our epaper solutions segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the continuing penetration of acrobat and its related technologies into major industry sectors and various government agencies 
revenue from our cross media publishing segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the new release of illustrator in the third quarter of fiscal this segment also benefited from the new release of framemaker in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as increased revenue from our adobe design collection  adobe type manager  acrobat inproduction  and pressready products 
the increase in revenue from this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our adobe publishing collection product  primarily due to the introduction of our new adobe web  dynamic media  and design collection products  and a decline in revenue in both our indesign product  due to slower adoption of this product in fiscal compared to the adoption rate upon the initial release of this product in fiscal  and our pagemaker products  due to product lifecycle timing 
the increase in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our oem postscript and other segment  as it decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from this segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower royalty rates paid by our oems and the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors loss of royalty revenue from hewlett packard company s hp desktop monochrome laser printer division  which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript software into its products since the fall of  a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers  and an increase in the use of inkjet printers  resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market 
we categorize our geographic results into three major market regions the americas  emea  and asia 
in fiscal  revenue generated in the americas  emea  and asia represented   and of total revenue  respectively  compared to   and of total revenue  respectively generated in both fiscal and fiscal overall  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform decreased by in fiscal over fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform increased during the same period 
in fiscal  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of application products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal  and and  respectively  in fiscal we expect the trend towards the windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future 
direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue direct costs include product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies  hosted server costs  and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products 
direct costs decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower third party royalties  mainly associated with our postscript and type products revenue 
in addition  direct costs also decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower material costs 
the decrease in direct costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase in hosted server costs  due to the launch of adobe studio in the fourth quarter of fiscal direct costs also decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower localization and royalty costs  as well as a reduction in material costs as a result of our ongoing cost improvement program 
for fiscal  we anticipate that gross margin will be approximately of revenue after the proposed acquisition of accelio corporation accelio 
operating expenses research and development change change research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expenses and lower company bonuses 
in addition  research and development expenses also decreased due to lower contractor and professional fees as less development work was performed through outside sources 
these decreases were partially offset by increased salary and benefit expenses related to headcount growth to support product development efforts 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over fiscal and higher salary and benefit expenses as a result of headcount growth 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in the new network publishing economy and make significant investments in the development of our application software products  including those targeted for the growing digital imaging and digital video franchises 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as communicated on december   we are targeting research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal to be of revenue 
for fiscal year  we are targeting such expenditures also to be of revenue 
sales and marketing change change sales and marketing percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses  bonuses  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations  and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of higher salary and benefit expenses related to headcount growth and increased investments in product specific marketing activities 
these increases were offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expenses and company bonuses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses and higher outsourced technical support and order management fees 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to our focus on general corporate brand advertising  as well as higher marketing  public relations  and trade show activities associated with new product releases 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support investments in certain areas including digital imaging  digital video  and epaper based businesses 
as communicated on december   for the first quarter of fiscal  our sales and marketing expense target is approximately of revenue 
for fiscal year  we are targeting such expenditures also to be approximately of revenue

general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to decreased incentive compensation expenses and lower bad debt expense 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary and benefit expenses as a result of increased headcount 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses as a result of increased headcount  and higher bad debt expense and legal fees

for fiscal year  we are targeting such expenditures to be approximately of revenue 
restructuring and other charges change change restructuring and other charges percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our fiscal year revenue targets 
we believe this restructuring will enable us to increase our investment in digital imaging  digital video  and epaper based businesses in fiscal as part of the restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in force of positions  affecting organizations throughout the company 
the reductions came predominantly from sales and marketing and in our north american operations  and as of november   the majority of these terminations were completed 
the total restructuring and other charges was million  which was all related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force 
of the million in charges  million remained accrued at november  the majority of these severance payments will be paid in early for more information  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  restructuring and other charges consisted of million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one time litigation related expenses  and a credit of million related to the fiscal and fiscal restructuring programs 
the million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal and restructuring programs 
the credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within adobe 
the remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
for detailed information  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal we implemented two different restructuring programs 
these separate restructuring programs were directly focused on improving our competitive position as well as enhancing adobe s allocation of resources 
the two fiscal restructuring programs resulted in total charges of approximately million  which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges for vacating leased facilities 
during fiscal  we revised our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring programs implemented during the year  resulting in an adjustment to the restructuring accrual of approximately million 
the adjustment was due to lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within adobe  and lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
in addition  we recorded adjustments during fiscal related to prior year restructuring programs in the amount of million 
the million adjustment was primarily due to both our success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified and the expiration of other lease termination costs for two facilities 
other charges recorded in fiscal of million included million associated with the cancellation of a contract and million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program 
additionally  we incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of million to assist in the restructuring of our operations

interest and other income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to realized gains resulting from the sale of fixed income investments 
interest and other income also increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher average cash balances 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by foreign currency losses 
these foreign currency losses resulted from the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and subsequent recording of the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures in interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of more investments being made in tax exempt securities  resulting in lower interest income on a comparative pretax basis 
in fiscal  we also recorded foreign exchange transaction losses compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal in addition  other income was lower in fiscal  as fiscal included a million gain related to the sale of a corporate facility in edinburgh  scotland  in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal we expect interest and other income to decrease slightly to approximately million per quarter in fiscal due to a lower interest rate environment 
we also believe that any increases in interest income may be offset by the cost of foreign currency purchased options as well as market price volatility under our implementation of sfas further  we believe that our cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal due to the strategic purchase of companies  products  or technologies and our ongoing stock repurchase programs 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations 
as communicated on december   we have targeted our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal to approximately 
factors that may affect future results of operations we believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business  including the recent slow down affecting the us  europe  japan  and potentially other geographic areas continuing adverse economic impact of the recent national tragedy on september  delays in shipment of our new products and major new versions of existing products corporate reductions in marketing expenditures which may result in lower demand for professional content creation and layout products lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades introduction of new products by major competitors weakness in demand for application software and printers lack of growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and downward sales price adjustments renegotiation of royalty arrangements consolidation in the oem printer business ongoing weakness in our printing business due to product transitions industry transitions to new business and information delivery models market risks associated with our equity investments as discussed later under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on december   we stated that we are targeting our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of to million 
on that day  we also stated the following operating model targets for the first quarter of fiscal gross margin of  pro forma operating profit margin of  research and development expenses of of revenue  sales and marketing expenses of of revenue  and general and administrative expenses of of revenue 
we further stated on december   that we expect our share count to be between to million shares  which collectively results in a pro forma earnings per share target range of to  in the first quarter of fiscal on january   we reiterated our revenue and earnings per share targets for the first quarter of fiscal of to million and to  respectively 
the reaffirmation of these targets assumes that the third month of the quarter will be a typical seasonally strong february 
also on december   we reiterated our annual revenue target of billion  gross margin target of  and our pre tax pro forma operating profit margin target of for fiscal year and a pro forma earnings per share target of approximately 
additionally  we have stated  the following operating model targets for fiscal research and development expenses of of revenue  sales and marketing expenses of of revenue  and general and administrative expenses of of revenue 
we have stated an effective tax rate target of 
we have also previously stated that we are targeting other income to be approximately million per quarter 
due to the current interest rate environment  however  we have stated a revised target for interest and other income of approximately million per quarter in fiscal on february   we announced a proposed agreement to acquire accelio corporation 
based on an anticipated close date of march  we are targeting incremental revenue associated with this acquisition of approximately million 
in addition  with the acquisition of accelio  we have lowered our gross margin target from to  and our pro forma operating profit margin target from to 
furthermore  we indicated that the acquisition would be dilutive to pro forma earnings per share of per share in fiscal year the proposed acquisition is subject to the execution of customary transaction documents and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the approval of accelio s shareholders and clearance of the acquisition by us and canadian regulatory authorities 
if these conditions are not satisfied  we may not complete the acquisition 
initially the transaction was expected to close in march however  due to certain regulatory and timing requirements  we are now targeting to close in april in connection with this proposed acquisition  we may not be successful in integrating accelio or developing products based on accelio s technology or expertise 
we also may not be successful in integrating its distribution channels with ours 
additionally  we may face unanticipated expenses relating to the integration of accelio personnel and its products  distribution channels  and administrative functions 
we use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing and demand manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels  and geographic distribution headcount increases these and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from these targets 
in particular  the recent slow down in some geographic areas  primarily in the us  europe  and japan  has affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue targets 
we attribute this slow down  which is affecting all of our product segments  to weakening economic conditions 
these adverse economic conditions in the us  europe  japan  and potentially other geographic markets may continue in the short term  and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
although there were also adverse conditions in other countries  the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results 
furthermore  if the economic slow down worsens or spreads to other geographic areas where we do business  it would likely cause our future results  including results for the first quarter of fiscal  to vary materially from our targets 
we plan to recruit key talent for our future growth 
these plans to continue to invest in certain areas will require us to continue to hire additional employees 
competition for high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively  otherwise our business could be seriously harmed 
our ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have an impact on our results of operations 
our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings  or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
we hold equity investments that have recently experienced significant declines in market value 
we also have investments  and may continue to make future investments  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the market for the technologies or products they have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our investment activities can impact our net income 
for fiscal  we recorded pre tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of million  compared to pre tax gains in fiscal of million 
these amounts reflect realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities  and equity method gains and losses of adobe ventures 
in fiscal  decreases in the market prices of these securities resulted in a significant reduction in our pre tax income  and future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long term declines in value could reduce our net income in future periods 
we are uncertain of future investment gains and losses  as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
the market for our graphics and epaper applications is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
additionally  microsoft has increased its presence in the low end consumer digital imaging graphics market and the electronic document sharing markets 
we believe that  due to microsoft s market dominance  any new microsoft products in these markets will be highly competitive with our products 
if competing new products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results would suffer 
in addition  we continue to expand into third party distribution channels  including vars and systems integrators  in our effort to further broaden our customer base 
as a result  the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success 
some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate 
also  as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise  corporate business and consumer markets  we may not successfully adapt our application software distribution channels  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
as we currently have limited experience in these markets  we believe we will need to recruit  train  and retain personnel with experience in these markets  and our failure to do so may harm our ability to penetrate these markets 
we could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business 
in some markets and for some products  we have adopted a strategy aiming to increase our market share and therefore may receive significantly less revenue from certain licensing arrangements than we otherwise would receive for licensing these products 
therefore  increased market penetration may in fact lead to lower revenue growth in these areas 
while we believe that this potential market share increase will ultimately benefit us  this strategy could instead harm our business through reduced revenue growth 
we generally offer our application based products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  and we generally offer our server based products on the linux platform as well as these three platforms 
to the extent that there is a slow down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platform or in general  our business could be harmed 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  and retailers collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors 
one of these distributors recently restructured its operations  reducing the number of facilities it operates  including those handling adobe products  which may harm our operating results 
in addition  we have revised our channel program to reduce the overall number of our distributors worldwide and focus our channel efforts on larger distributors 
this revision of the channel program has resulted in an increase in our dependence on a smaller number of distributors selling through a larger amount of our products 
additionally  one of our goals is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our web site at www 
adobe 
com 
any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online  internet based resellers of our products 
while we anticipate that the restructuring and streamlining of our product distribution channels and the increase in the scope of our direct sales efforts will eventually improve our business by decreasing discounts or rebate programs provided to distributors  decreasing product returns  and shortening inventory cycles  these changes could instead seriously harm our business 
we currently rely on five turnkey assemblers of our products  located in each major region we serve 
if any turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us  or if our supply from any turnkey is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in the print business 
we expect this segment to continue to decline in fiscal relative to fiscal  which may harm our business if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations 
the continuing weakness in the economy is contributing to the decrease in revenue for the monochrome laser printers market in addition to the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers 
in addition  customer transition from paper based processes to electronic workflows  renegotiated pricing with certain oem customers  and the outsourcing of certain oem accounts to a third party solution provider contributed to the decline in revenue in this segment 
if another major customer also decided to incorporate a clone version instead of adobe postscript technology  it could seriously harm our business 
further  oem partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
we evaluate these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for us 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing authoring and communications over the internet is still developing 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been fully adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
we intend to increase our investment in e business and enhanced marketing activities in an effort to achieve revenue growth  but we can provide no assurance that increased investment in this new market will result in increased revenue 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in europe  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
we generally experience lower revenue from our european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months 
additionally  we are uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in europe  asia pacific and latin america markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions 
while most of the revenue of our european subsidiaries had in the past been denominated in us dollars  we now denominate revenue in euros in certain european countries 
in addition  the majority of our revenue derived from japan is denominated in yen  and the majority of all our subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the financial impact of such fluctuations has not been significant 
our hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
we have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen and the euro 
we regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment 
our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently  and may in the future be subject to complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation 
adverse decisions in such litigation could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
our accounting policies that may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows rules relating to software revenue recognition accounting for business combinations the valuation of in process research and development employee stock purchase plans stock option grants goodwill and other intangible assets accounting changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
see the discussion under critical accounting policies below for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies 
new fasb guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
on july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  that establishes a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life not be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually 
it would continue to require recognition of goodwill as an asset but would not permit amortization of goodwill as previously required by apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill will be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
any required goodwill impairment charges will be presented as a separate line item within the operating section of the income statement 
the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our financial position and are planning to adopt this standard beginning in fiscal year  as required 
it is possible that in the future  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded  as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings  or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade  compared to analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has caused in the past  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  accounting for our marketable and non marketable fixed income and equity securities  and accounting for leases of property and equipment 
revenue recognition we recognize application products revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates  and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection when given  and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel  and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on historical rates 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  nevertheless unsold products in these distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences or technological obsolescence due to new operating environments  product updates or competing products 
accordingly  it is possible that these estimates will change in the near future or that the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could seriously harm our business 
we provide free technical phone support to customers who are under warranty for support 
we accrue the estimated cost of free technical phone support upon shipment of software and amortize the accrued internal and external cost of telephone support to sales and marketing expense 
we also license software with post contract customer support pcs for two years 
pcs includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
the arrangement fee for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement  such as maintenance and support services  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically two years 
we record oem licensing revenue  primarily royalties  when oem partners ship products incorporating adobe software  provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable 
we have no remaining obligations in relation to such licensing revenue 
we also recognize revenue under a subscription based model for our adobe studio website  which we launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue is recognized on a monthly basis from fees received that month for providing software subscriptions for our hosted application 
deferred revenue includes customer advances under oem licensing agreements and maintenance revenue for application products 
we recognize deferred maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the contract  generally twenty four months 
in cases where we will provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product  we defer revenue until the future obligation is fulfilled 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been within our expectations 
accounting for our marketable and non marketable fixed income and equity securities we classify all of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are free of trading restrictions  or become free of trading restrictions within one year  as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized on our consolidated statements of income 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
for more information on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our long term investments include direct investments and indirect investments in privately held companies 
we own limited partnership interests in four venture capital limited partnerships  adobe ventures lp  adobe ventures ii  lp  adobe ventures iii  lp  and adobe ventures iv  lp collectively adobe ventures  that invest in early stage companies with innovative technologies 
in addition to the potential for financial returns  our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies  as well as expand our ecosystem of adobe products and services 
the partnerships are managed by granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures 
the investments in adobe ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  the investments are adjusted to reflect our share of adobe ventures investment income loss and dividend distributions 
adobe ventures carry their investments in equity securities at estimated fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in investment income loss 
the stock of a number of technology investments held by the limited partnerships at november  are not publicly traded  and  therefore  there is no established market for their securities 
as such  the fair value of these investments are determined by granite ventures using the most recent round of financing involving new non strategic investors  or estimates made by granite ventures 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments held by adobe ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting and the related writedown is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale or maturity of these investments using the specific identification method 
for further information on our long term investments  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for leases of property and equipment we entered into two operating lease agreements in and related to our headquarter office buildings in san jose  ca 
the agreements qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas  accounting for leases  and  as such  the buildings are not included on our balance sheet 
these agreements are subject to standard covenants  including liquidity  leverage  and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under the agreements  but if we default on our commitments and are unable to remedy the default quickly enough  the lessors may terminate all remaining commitments  demand payment equal to the lessor s investment  or require us to purchase  facilitate the sale of the buildings to a third party  or surrender the buildings 
if we are required to purchase the buildings  this will decrease our cash available for working capital and require us to add the value of the buildings to our balance sheet 
if we facilitate the sale or surrender the buildings  this could require us to find alternate facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement 
as of november   we were in compliance with all covenants 
for further information on these leases  please refer to our commitments section under liquidity and capital resources and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we disclose pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
our pro forma financial information does not include unusual or non recurring events or transactions  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles  or gains and losses on investments in equity securities 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
the following table shows the company s pro forma results reconciled to the gaap consolidated statement of income for fiscal year ended november  our pro forma results for the fiscal year exclude restructuring and other charges  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles  and investment loss 
year ended november  gaap income before income taxes  restructuring and other charges amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles  investment loss  pro forma income before income taxes  income tax provision  pro forma net income  basic pro forma net income per share shares used in computing basic net income per share  diluted net income per share shares used in computing diluted net income per share  pro forma fair value disclosures on employee stock plans we account for our employee stock plans  consisting of fixed stock option plans  an employee stock purchase plan  and a performance and restricted stock plan  using the intrinsic value method 
please see our note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma amounts of net income and net income per share that would have resulted if we accounted for our employee stock plans under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements during july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
this statement requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and redefines goodwill and other intangibles that should be recognized separate from goodwill 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  during july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life not be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  for new business combinations that occur after june   sfas is effective for those transactions 
we will adopt sfas beginning in our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  or normal use of the asset 
as used in this statement  a legal obligation results from existing law  statute  ordinance  written or oral contract  or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas beginning in our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no 
addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer and is a codification of eitf no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  eitf no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentives offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future and eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
we are evaluating the impact of eitf no 
and do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consist principally of money market funds  municipal bonds  and marketable equity securities 
all of our short term investments are classified as available for sale under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the securities are carried at fair market value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized on the consolidated statements of income 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased million  or  from december   primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock in the amount of million  the purchase of long term investments and other assets for million  capital expenditures of million  and the payment of dividends totaling million 
in addition  our short term investments decreased due to the writedown of certain short term marketable equity investments totaling million and the sale of marketable equity investments with a cost basis of million 
these decreases were partially offset by cash generated from operations of million and proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
another source of cash included proceeds from the sale of equity securities of million 
our existing cash  cash equivalent and investment balances may decline further during fiscal  although we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next months 
if the global economy weakens further  the decline in cash  cash equivalents and investments balances may be greater than presently anticipated 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including expenditures for computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and strategically acquire companies  products  or technologies 
adobe s board of directors approved two separate two for one stock splits in the form of stock dividends of our common stock to stockholders effected october  and october  all share and per share amounts referred to in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect these stock splits 
we have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of adobe s board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal   and the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of adobe s board of directors and will depend on business conditions  our results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
stock repurchase program i on going dilution coverage to facilitate our stock repurchase program  which is designed to minimize dilution from employee stock plans  we sold put warrants to independent third parties in fiscal   and each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of adobe s common stock to adobe at a specified price for cash or stock at adobe s option 
approximately million  million  and million put warrants were written in fiscal   and  respectively 
at november   approximately million put warrants were outstanding that expire through july  with an average exercise price of per share  resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately million in fiscal if all puts warrants are exercised 
in addition  in fiscal   and  we purchased call options from independent third parties that entitled us to buy million  million  and million shares  respectively  of our common stock on certain dates at specified prices 
at november   approximately million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through july with an average exercise price of per share  resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately million in fiscal if all calls options are exercised 
currently  all put warrants have a corresponding call option with an identical expiry date

legal actions we are engaged in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that we have adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in japan  and beginning in fiscal  euro denominated licenses in certain european countries 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  and our european operating expenses are in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated licenses 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
at november   total outstanding contracts included million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of million 
all contracts expire at various times through may our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with high quality counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  have a duration between three to twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar usd  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions 
the changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income on the consolidated statement of income 
the time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income over the life of the contract 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of november   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at december   a decrease of 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could experience further adverse changes in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of minus   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
potential decrease to the value of securities given x decrease in each stock s price fair value as of november  marketable equity securities equity forward contracts we also have a policy to hedge a certain portion of our equity holdings in publicly traded companies 
from time to time  we have entered into forward contracts to sell portions of our equity holdings in future periods 
we account for these forward contracts as fair value hedges  in accordance with sfas and mark them to market at the end of each period  offsetting changes in the fair market value of the equities being hedged 
an increase decrease in the market value of the underlying equities will result in a corresponding decrease increase in the value of the forward contract 
we have no outstanding forward contracts hedging marketable equity securities remaining as of november  as of december   the value of our forward contracts hedging equity securities was million 
fixed income investments at november   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million compared to million at december   an increase of 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given x increase in interest rates 
month horizon month horizon we do not currently have any derivative financial instruments outstanding to manage interest rate risks 
however  we have established policies and procedures to allow entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk if appropriate 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer  and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our entire initial investment in these companies 
we have a policy in place to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting and the related writedown is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
facility leases we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of our facilities whose payments are tied to the libor and have evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in libor 
market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel increases in the libor curve of plus or minus   and basis points for a twelve month period 
based on this analysis  such charges would not be material to our results of operations or financial position
