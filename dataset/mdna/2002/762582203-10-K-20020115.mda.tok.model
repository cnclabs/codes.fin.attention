item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and foreign competition 
the sections below describe the company s exposure to interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodities prices 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are illustrative and should not be viewed as predictive of future financial performance 
additionally  the company cannot assure that the company s and or its subsidiaries actual results in any particular year will not differ from the amounts indicated below 
foreign exchange risk the subsidiaries of the company operate in costa rica and are exposed to market risk from changes in us currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange risk derives from the fact that the company makes its payments in dollars for the majority of its imported raw materials and bank facilities  and its revenues are mostly denominated in colones 
the company does not currently maintain a trading portfolio and does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage its risks 
to mitigate its exposure to variations in devaluations  the company systematically increases its annual sales prices by a rate that is consistent with the colon devaluation against the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  the colon devaluation rates were  and  respectively  and correspondingly  the company increased its sales prices  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s strong market will allow for continued price increases without sacrificing long term demand and market share 
for fiscal year  due to the adverse economic climate  the company temporarily decided not to make any significant increases to its sales prices as a marketing strategy in order to best maintain sales and market share 
the exchange rate between the colon and the us dollar is determined in a free exchange market  supervised by the banco central de costa rica banco central 
for the last years  banco central has utilized the crawling peg method whereby the colon is devalued daily on a systematic basis 
the company believes that an additional annual decline of the colon in the colon dollar exchange rate is reasonably possible over the next year 
as of september   the company had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million denominated in us dollars 
the potential foreign exchange loss resulting from a hypothetical decline during the year in the colon dollar exchange rate would be approximately  this loss would be reflected in the balance sheet as increases in the principal amount of its dollar denominated indebtedness and in the income statement as an increase in foreign exchange losses  reflecting the increased cost of servicing dollar denominated indebtedness 
this analysis does not take into account the positive effect that the hypothetical decline would have on accounts receivable and other assets denominated in us dollars 
interest rate risk as of september   the company had outstanding a total of approximately million in loans and other debt  of which million bore variable interest rates  based primarily on libor or us prime rate for its colones and dollar denominated indebtedness 
a hypothetical  simultaneous and unfavorable change of in the company s variable rate in effect as of september  would result in a potential increase in interest expense of  accordingly  the sensitivity analysis model may overstate the impact of the company s interest rate risk  as uniform movements of all interest rates applicable to its financial liabilities are unlikely to occur simultaneously 
commodity risk the company imports all of its corn and soybean meal  the primary ingredients in chicken feed  from the united states 
fluctuations in the price of corn may significantly affect the company s profit margin 
for fiscal year  the company s average monthly purchases approximated million and  respectively 
the price of corn and soybean meal  like most grain commodities  is fairly volatile and requires constant and daily hedging in order to minimize the effect of price increases on the company s profit margin 
the company purchases its corn through the chicago board of trade cbot and has been actively hedging its exposure to corn price fluctuations since the company s strategy is to hedge against price increases in corn and soybean meal  and it is not involved in speculative trading 
contract terms range from one month to six months 
the company buys directly from the spot market if market conditions are favorable  but as a general rule  the company purchases most of its corn through contracts 
the company s hedging strategy is set in its annual budget  which determines how much corn and soybean meal the company will need and the price the company must pay in order to meet budget forecasts 
the company uses an internal pricing model to prepare sensitivity analyses 
the company bases its target prices on the worst case price assumptions ie high prices 
the prices paid by the company for corn and soy bean meal were and above its budgeted prices  respectively  for the year ended september  the company purchases its soybean meal through a company in costa rica  inolasa  in which the company holds a equity interest 
in costa rica  there is an applicable tax for soybean meal imports  which is not levied if such imports are purchased through inolasa 
if for any reason inolasa cannot deliver the soybean meal to the company  the company can buy its soybean meal directly from the cbot 
thus far  the company has never had to purchase soybean meal directly from the cbot 
the company has a  credit line with futures usa  inc fimat and draws upon this credit line to cover its initial margin deposit 
the interest rate paid on this line of credit averages an annual rate of less than on drawn amounts 
a hypothetical and increase in the monthly price of corn and soybean meal based on fiscal year  respectively  would have resulted in an increase in cost of sales of approximately million 
foreign competition the company believes that the likelihood of a threat by foreign competitors is low based on the preference of the costa rican consumer for fresh  high quality chicken produced by the company  as opposed to frozen imported chicken  and quotas established by the costa rican government 
the agriculture ministry in costa rica monitors all chicken entering the country to prevent the spread of newcastle disease in costa rica 
the market in costa rica is also assisted by existing tariff agreements 
chicken importers must pay duties as dictated by the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt 
these agreements were reached at the uruguay round of the gatt negotiations  which are scheduled to end in  after which it is probable that similar negotiations will continue 
the agreements and current negotiations that are being carried out with the present costa rican government provide quotas and scaled tariffs  and permit only certain cuts to enter the costa rican market
