item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussions and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  and the selected financial data and operating data contained elsewhere herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  medical claims reserve  valuation of assets held for sale and costs to return aircraft and a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
such historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition the financial arrangement between mesa and their code share partners involve either a revenue guarantee or pro rate arrangement 
under a revenue guarantee arrangement  the major airline generally pays a monthly guaranteed amount 
both the america west code share agreement and the us airways regional jet code share agreement are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under the terms of these flying agreements  the major carrier controls marketing  scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories 
the company receives a guaranteed payment based upon a fixed minimum monthly amount plus amounts related to departures and block hours flown plus direct reimbursement for expenses such as fuel  landing fees and insurance 
among other advantages  revenue guarantee arrangements reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic and fare levels  as well as fuel prices 
the us airways turboprop and the frontier jetexpress code share agreements are pro rate agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts as discussed above  amounts billed under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to the interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by the code share partner 
periodically our code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than those billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
as such  the company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if the company s actual ability to collect these 
table of contents receivables and the actual financial viability of its partners is materially different than estimated  the company s estimate of the allowance could be materially understated or overstated 
accrued health care costs the company is currently self insured for health care costs and as such  estimates a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date 
the company s estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of its health care provider 
at september  and  the company has accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the reserves for future health care claims could be materially overstated or understated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
the company determines the fair value based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets and or independent appraisals 
long lived assets to be disposed of and parts held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
aircraft and parts held for sale are comprised of aircraft the company has identified as surplus as well as expendable and rotable inventory that is in excess of the company s needs 
aircraft currently identified as held for sale are under contract to return to the manufacturer and are valued at the contract price  less the cost to return the aircraft to meet the manufacturer s return conditions 
the company estimates quantities of rotable and expendable inventory that are surplus to its needs by employing independent consultants who utilize mathematical models to determine optimum inventory levels based on such variables as size of fleet  number of maintenance bases and desired reliability 
quantities of rotable and expendable inventory that are surplus to the company s needs are valued at fair market value  less costs to sell 
fair market value is determined based upon the company s experience in selling similar assets and outside appraisals 
if the actual value of these surplus parts is materially different than estimated  the company s estimate of fair market value could be materially understated or overstated 
costs to return aircraft held for sale the company periodically returns aircraft to the manufacturer or lessor that have been identified as excess 
it is standard practice in the industry that aircraft returns must meet established contractual return conditions 
the ultimate cost of completing the maintenance necessary to meet these return conditions is not known until all the work is completed and accepted by the manufacturer or lessor 
as such  the company estimates these costs at the time of the decision to the return aircraft 
the company s estimates are based upon historical experience in performing this and similar maintenance  however  the ultimate cost cannot be readily determined until the aircraft or engine is opened and examined 
at september  and  the company accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost to return aircraft 
if the ultimate cost to return these aircraft is significantly different than what has been estimated  the reserves for the costs to return aircraft could be materially overstated or understated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews these assets for realizability based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent the company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september  and  the company had a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets not expected to be realized of million and million  respectively 
if the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets could be materially overstated or understated 

table of contents results of operations general mesa air group  inc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as mesa or the company is an independently owned regional airline serving cities in states  canada and mexico 
at september   mesa operated a fleet of aircraft and had approximately daily departures 
mesa s airline operations during fiscal year were conducted by three regional airline subsidiaries primarily utilizing hub and spoke systems 
mesa airlines  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa  operates as america west express under a code share and revenue sharing agreement with america west airlines  inc  as us airways express under code sharing agreements with us airways  inc and as frontier jet express under a code sharing agreement with frontier 
air midwest  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa  also operates under a code sharing agreement with us airways and flies as us airways express and also operates an independent division  doing business as mesa airlines  from albuquerque  new mexico and dallas  texas 
air midwest also has a code sharing agreement with midwest express in kansas city on flights operated as us airways express 
prior to it ceasing operations on november   ccair  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa  operated under a code share agreement with us airways that permitted ccair to operate under the name us airways express and to charge their joint passengers on a combined basis with us airways 
in addition  freedom airlines  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mesa air group  inc 
began operating as america west express pursuant to the code share and revenue sharing agreement with america west in october the following tables set forth selected operating and financial data of the company for the years indicated below 
operating data years ended september  passengers available seat miles asm s revenue passenger miles s load factor yield per revenue passenger mile cents revenue per asm cents operating cost per asm cents average stage length miles number of operating aircraft in fleet gallons of fuel consumed block hours flown departures 
table of contents operating expense data years ended september   and cost cost cost percent per percent per percent per amount of total asm amount of total asm amount of total asm s revenues cents s revenues cents s revenues cents flight operations maintenance aircraft traffic servicing promotion sales general administrative depreciation amortization impairment and restructuring charge total operating expenses interest expense other income expense fiscal versus fiscal general operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenues decreased by million to million  from million in fiscal although our revenue decreased  revenue under revenue guarantee contracts increased by in fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the increase was the addition of regional jets that were placed into service in eight of which were operated pursuant to revenue guarantee agreements for the majority of the year 
offsetting this increase  revenue derived from our pro rate revenue operations  which currently accounts for approximately of our revenue  decreased compared to the prior year 
the decrease in pro rate revenue was primarily due to reductions in pro rate flying capacity and industry wide declines in load factors as a result of september th 
as a result of decreases in capacity and the effects of the events of september   passengers traveling on such pro rate flights decreased for the year 
under revenue guarantee contracts  we are substantially insulated from industry passenger trends 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the million decrease in expense in fiscal  is primarily attributable to the reduction in turboprop flying as well as cost reduction initiatives related to the turboprop operation  which included million associated with the raytheon agreement 
the decrease on a cost per asm basis for the year ended september   is a result of an increase in the proportion of regional jet asms in our fleet 
regional jets generally have lower operating costs per asm than turboprop aircraft 

table of contents maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in maintenance costs for fiscal is primarily the result of million in benefits received as part of the cost reduction agreement reached with raytheon aerospace and reduced turboprop flights 
the decrease was offset by higher than expected engine maintenance in the fourth quarter due to problems related to unexpected component failures  resulting in the premature removal and overhaul of jet engines 
the decrease in cost per asm is a result of an increase in the proportion of regional jet asms and the turboprop cost reduction initiatives 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease in aircraft and traffic service expense is primarily due to reduced turboprop flights 
on an asm basis  the reduction is a result of the increase in the proportion of regional jet asms 
the company can service regional jets with the same number of personnel as smaller turboprop aircraft even though regional jets carry more passengers 
in addition  the company also had more regional jets in service under the us airways contract in than in under our regional jet contract with us airways  many of the aircraft and traffic servicing expenses are absorbed directly by us airways 
promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in booking fees and franchise fees paid to the company s code share partners as a result of the decrease in pro rate passenger traffic 
our contract with america west and our jet contract with us airways eliminate booking fees and travel agency commissions being charged directly to the company and as such  these costs per asm are expected to decline as the america west express and us airways express jet operations continue to grow 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of million  which was due to allowances for receivables recorded in the prior year as a result of the effect that terrorist attacks that took place on september  had on our code share partners 
in addition  professional fees decreased approximately million as the majority of the legal costs associated with the beus gilbert matter were accrued in we also reduced our k matching contribution by million in these decreases were offset by increases in passenger liability insurance of million due to increased premiums as a result of the events of september  as well as a million contract claim release to us airways as a result of the us airways bankruptcy restructuring 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on aircraft and parts held for sale and reduced depreciation expense on the aircraft that were impaired at september  we are also no longer incurring goodwill amortization expense as all goodwill was written off at september  impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s subsidiary  ccair made a decision to discontinue its operations 
as a result of this decision  the company recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of million 
the charge is comprised of million of severance and other employee related liabilities  million in aircraft related return costs  million for future aircraft lease payments  million to reduce the value of rotable and expendable inventory to fair market value less costs to sell  million to 
table of contents write off the value of equipment and leasehold improvements and million to reduce maintenance deposits held by a lessor to net realizable value 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we returned of the bd aircraft permitted under our agreement with raytheon 
as a result of unanticipated increases in the cost of meeting return conditions  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
the remaining three aircraft are expected to be returned to raytheon by the end of the fiscal second quarter of we also took a charge of million to accrue for the remaining lease payments and future costs of returning two shorts aircraft the company is subleasing to an operator in europe 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense of million from million in to million in is due to reduced interest rates as the majority of our beechcraft d fleet is financed at variable interest rates as well as million in benefits received from raytheon aerospace as part of the cost reduction agreement 
other income and expense in fiscal  other income and expense decreased million from income of million cents per asm in to expense of million in included in other income is million in net investment related losses unrealized losses of million offset by realized gains of million 
the investment losses include losses from the company s portfolio of aviation related securities  including million incurred by our subsidiary ufly 
the minority interest in these losses is deducted out of our net income or loss after income taxes 
included in other income for fiscal was million in grants received from the dot as part of the airline transportation safety and system stabilization act 
fiscal versus fiscal operating revenues in fiscal  operating revenues increased by million to million  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of regional jets employed under revenue guarantee contracts with america west and us airways 
operating expenses flight operations in fiscal  flight operations expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the million increase was primarily due to increased fuel costs of approximately million  increased lease costs of approximately million and increased pilot wages of approximately million as well as an increase of million related to health insurance costs 
these expense increases were the result of adding additional regional jets in fiscal maintenance expense in fiscal  maintenance expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal increased maintenance expenditures are primarily due to the increased number of activity based or time sensitive maintenance events and the expiration of the warranty period on many of our crj aircraft 
aircraft and traffic servicing expense in fiscal  aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the relative stability of aircraft and traffic servicing expense is due to the company serving approximately the same number of cities in as in  versus  respectively 

table of contents promotion and sales in fiscal  promotion and sales expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the company s continued downsizing of its bd fleet and the resulting decrease in prorate flying 
general and administrative expense in fiscal  general and administrative expense increased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the million increase is primarily due to million in allowances on receivables from our code share partners as a result of the impact of the attacks of september th and the impact that the decline in passenger traffic and softening economy have had on their business and ability to pay  million in reserves for professional fees and an increase of approximately million in property taxes as a result of increases to the company s jet fleet 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million cents per asm from million cents per asm in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on bd aircraft held for sale 
impairment and restructuring charges in the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a charge of approximately million on bd aircraft we returned or intend to return to the manufacturer 
the charge was comprised of an impairment loss to write the aircraft down to the contractual selling price less the estimated costs to prepare the aircraft for return to the manufacturer 
due to the economic slowdown and the effects of the terrorist attacks in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off the unamortized value of the goodwill associated with certain bd route systems totaling million 
the company also took an additional charge of approximately million related to its bd fleet 
the charge is comprised of an impairment loss of million on the value of bd aircraft the company is planning to continue to fly 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a decision to discontinue operating jetstream super aircraft from its charlotte hub 
as a result of this decision  the company took a million charge that is included in other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities at september  the charge is comprised of million related to the remaining lease payments on nine jetstream super aircraft  million related to the costs to buyout the remaining term of the maintenance contract associated with these aircraft and million related to costs to return the aircraft 
we also elected to accelerate the disposition of excess inventory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we hired an independent consulting firm to determine our inventory needs and to value our surplus inventory 
prior to september   the company had been selling off surplus inventory on a passive basis as opportunities arose 
as a result of this decision  the company took a million charge to reduce its surplus inventory to net realizable value  less costs to sell 
the surplus inventory is carried on the balance sheet under the heading of aircraft and parts held for sale 
other income and expense included in other income is million related to amounts received and to be received from the dot under the air transportation safety and stabilization act 
this amount is offset by million in net investment related losses unrealized losses of million offset by realized gains of million 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september   compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september  primary uses of cash included i repaying million in funds borrowed under our line of credit after september th   ii reducing accounts payable by million after extending the days outstanding in 
table of contents the periods following the events of september   iii capital expenditures of million primarily rotable aircraft parts  iv principal payments on long term debt of million  v cost to return aircraft of million and vi repurchases of common stock of million 
offsetting these uses of cash  cash sources included i receiving million from past contractual claims and million in various lease incentives that are included in deferred credits  ii sales and reductions in levels of expendable and rotable inventory of million  iii net return of aircraft deposits of million and iv net contributions from minority interest shareholders of ufly of million 
the above factors  among others  resulted in a million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal  which comprises the majority of the decrease noted above 
as of september   we had receivables of approximately million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  compared to million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million at september  the amounts due consist primarily of receivables due from our code share partners  passenger ticket receivables due through the airline clearing house ach and amounts due from the dot under the airline stabilization act 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased as a result of the settlement with us airways where previously reserved receivables were written off against the allowance 
during fiscal  we had code share agreements with america west  us airways  frontier airlines and midwest express airlines 
approximately  and of the company s consolidated passenger revenue for the years ended september   and  respectively  were derived from these agreements 
accounts receivable from our code share partners were and of total gross accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
a reduction in business travel  a slowing economy and the terrorist attacks of september  all have had a significant impact on the airline industry  including america west and us airways 
continuing declines in the economy or an inability to receive government grants and loan guarantees could have a material adverse effect on the viability of either of these airlines 
a termination of the america west or us airways code share agreements specifically the jet contracts would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if a termination without renewal should occur  management believes they would be able to reduce costs quickly through reductions in headcount or parking aircraft 
additionally management believes they could continue flying certain routes or transfer certain aircraft  particularly the regional jets  to new markets and new code share arrangements with other carriers 
as of december   we had cash and marketable securities in excess of million 
management believes additional proceeds of approximately million could be generated through the cancellation of aircraft orders 
management believes these actions would provide sufficient working capital to meet its operating needs 
in june  we entered into an agreement with empresa brasiliera de aeronautica sa embraer to acquire embraer erj passenger regional jets 
we introduced the erj aircraft into revenue service in the third quarter of fiscal as us airways express 
as of september   the company had taken delivery of erj s  which have been financed as operating leases 
we have the right to cancel the four remaining firm aircraft 
in conjunction with this purchase agreement  we have million remaining on deposit with embraer  which is included with lease and equipment deposits at september  the remaining deposit will be returned either upon the delivery of the last four aircraft or notification by us of our intention to cancel the orders 
we have significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
the leases are classified as operating leases and are therefore excluded from our consolidated balance sheets 
at september   we leased aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at september  our long term debt was primarily incurred pursuant to the acquisition of our bd aircraft 
in  the company retired million in debt by returning bd aircraft 
at september   we owned bd aircraft which have underlying maturities through 
table of contents in december  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to of the outstanding shares of our common stock approximately million shares 
in january  the board approved the repurchase by the company of up to an additional one million shares of our common stock 
as of september   we had acquired and retired approximately million shares approximately of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million  leaving approximately  shares available for repurchase under the existing board authorizations 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional two million shares 
purchases are made at management s discretion based on market conditions and the company s financial resources 
we have negotiated year engine maintenance contracts with general electric aircraft engines ge for our crj aircraft  rolls royce allison rolls royce for our erj aircraft and pratt and whitney  canada aircraft services pwc for our dash aircraft 
the ge contract requires a monthly payment based upon flight hours incurred 
the rolls royce and pwc contracts provide for payment at the time of the repair event for a fixed dollar amount per flight hour 
the rate under all contracts is subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
in december  we reached agreement with fleet capital for a million line of credit  collateralized by the company s inventory and receivables 
the agreement  which expires in december  has provisions that allow the expansion of available credit to million by adding new lenders provided that there is additional collateral 
the agreement also contains a financial covenant that requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios related to fixed charge coverage and total debt to capital 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at september  we intend to use the facility for general working capital purposes 
we also had million in letters of credit outstanding at september   which reduced the amount available under our line of credit with fleet 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at september  based upon available collateral  million remained available under the line at september  in may  we entered into an agreement with brad to acquire seat crj s  seat crj s and seat crj s the brad agreement 
under the agreement  mesa has the right to convert up to five crj aircraft to crj aircraft and to cancel the crj aircraft 
we have notified brad of our intention to convert to crj s 
the total number of firm aircraft orders is now crj s and crj s 
we secured the order with a million deposit and will continue to make monthly deposits of approximately million through april in february  bombardier returned million of deposits to the company and applied million to outstanding obligations 
deposits of million will be returned to us upon completion of permanent financing on the first five aircraft  per aircraft 
the remaining deposits will be returned on a pro rata basis in equal amounts upon completion of permanent financing on each of the last five aircraft million per aircraft 
the transaction includes standard product support provisions  including training support  preferred pricing on initial inventory provisioning  maintenance support and technical publication support 
the aggregate list value of the crj and s to be acquired under the agreement is approximately billion 
deliveries of the crj commenced in july  with revenue service commencing in october 
we are the launch customer of the crj and expect to take delivery of the first aircraft in the first calendar quarter of in addition to the firm orders  we have an option to acquire an additional crj and crj regional jets 
in conjunction with the brad agreement  we have million on deposit with brad  which is included with lease and equipment deposits at september  on august   us airways  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
as a result of this filing  us airways was required to obtain ratification of its code share and revenue guarantee agreements with the company 
should us airways not emerge from bankruptcy  this could have a material adverse effect on the company 
subsequent to year end  the company reached agreement with us airways to expand their regional jet agreement by adding seat regional jets to the existing fleet of regional jet aircraft 
the additional regional jets are scheduled to be integrated into the us airways express network in  subject to compliance with the jets for jobs provisions of the us airways pilot contract 
the aircraft are expected to be provided from a combination of internal and external sources 
the agreement  including the original regional jets under contract  was ratified by the united states bankruptcy court on november  
table of contents additionally  on november   the company signed a non binding letter of intent with us airways to provide an additional regional jets and issue a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
these aircraft  which will also be subject to jets for jobs  would be delivered beginning in mid to late as part of the us airways bankruptcy restructuring  the company also agreed to release our claim against million in payments previously withheld by us airways following the events of september  management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet our operating needs 
this is a forward looking statement 
actual cash flows could materially differ from this forward looking statement as a result of many factors  including the termination of one or more code share agreements  failure of us airways to emerge from bankruptcy protection  failure to sell  dispose of  or redeploy excess aircraft in a timely manner  a substantial decrease in the number of routes allocated to us under its code share agreements with our code share partners  reduced levels of passenger revenue  additional taxes or costs of compliance with governmental regulations  fuel cost increases  increases in competition  additional terrorist attacks  increases in interest rates  general economic conditions and unfavorable settlement of existing litigation 
commitments as of september   we had million in long term debt including current maturities 
this amount consisted primarily of million in notes payable related to the company s fleet of beechcraft d turboprop aircraft  million related to the settlement of past contractual claims of an aircraft manufacturer and million related to a mortgage note payable on one of our real estate properties 
the following table sets forth our cash obligations as of september  thereafter total long term debt notes payable related to bds note payable to manufacturer mortgage note payable other total long term debt payments under operating leases cash aircraft rental payments lease payments on equipment and operating facilities total lease payments total lease payments on aircraft flown pursuant to the our guaranteed revenue agreements are reimbursed by the applicable code share partner 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs  as defined in eitf  was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the company after december  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
the company s debt obligations are primarily variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
the company also has investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year  there would be no material impact on the company s interest income 
the company s investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to fluctuations in share prices for those shares held 
a change in the price of trading securities held at the level of investment at september  would impact the results of the company by approximately million 
we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  both the us airways and america west contract code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  of our fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense which is not reimbursed by our code share partners
