overview we began our operations in november  launched our first netphone product in july  and were established as a separate subsidiary of idt in october we have incurred net operating losses since inception and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future 
during the past twelve months  we have aggressively consolidated our company to focus on three primary lines of business 
we have cut our expenses through a series of reductions in workforce and de emphasized our activities in certain markets to focus our resources on what we believe are opportunities with higher gross margins 
the financial impact of these expense reduction initiatives is described in more detail in the discussion of restructuring severance  impairment and other special items below as well as in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
during the most recent four fiscal quarters  we have attained improved earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda which excludes restructuring  severance  impairment and other items  inventory obsolescence expense  certain one time selling  general and administrative expenses  the write off of acquired in process research and development  and  non cash compensation charges from the issuance of stock options 
ebitda losses have significantly narrowed in fiscal from million in the three months ended october   to million for the three months ended january   to million for the three months ended april   to million for the three months ended july  financial analysts generally consider ebitda to be an important measure of our operating performance 
however  ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating loss  net loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  fixed assets  access line costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k revenue recognition 
our primary source of revenue is communication services revenue from the sale of minutes over our voice over internet protocol  or voip  network 
we sell these minutes  or access to these minutes  through our various businesses  including our international communications services group and our domestic retail services group 
our international communications service revenue is recognized as service is provided  that is  as minutes are used 
our retail sales revenue  which consists primarily of pre paid calling card revenue  is also recognized as our service is provided  that is  as minutes are used  or when service fees are charged 
we also recognize revenue from pre payments for our services after we conduct evaluations of outstanding remaining pre payment balances and determine  based on historical data  that such balances are not likely to be utilized 
the sale of equipment with software necessary to provide our services is recognized when such products are delivered  collection of payments is assured and there are no significant future obligations 
to date  we have recognized no revenue from our broadband business 
impairment of long lived assets 
as of july   we had fixed assets with a net carrying value of million  intangible assets of million and goodwill of million 
the recoverability of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets are evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss will be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount  with the loss measured based on discounted expected cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or upon an indication that their value may be impaired 
expense recognition versus capitalized costs 
purchases that provide benefit to future periods and have useful lives greater than one year are capitalized 
all other purchases are expensed in the period the underlying goods and or services are received 
specifically o equipment and furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to fifteen years 
o computer software is amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of five years or the term of the related agreement 
o software development costs for the internal development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
as we have completed our software development concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  we have not capitalized these costs 
we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
these costs consist of payments made to third parties and the salaries of employees working on such software development

net loss available to common stockholders comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our primary source of revenue is communication services revenue from the sale of minutes over our voice over internet protocol  or voip  network 
we sell these minutes  or access to these minutes  through our various business groups  including our international communications services group and our domestic retail services group 
our international communications service revenue is recognized as service is provided  that is  as minutes are used 
we also earn revenue from the sale of internet telephony equipment 
our aggregate revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to management s active restructuring of our company during the fiscal year 
we diminished our activities in certain sales channels  such as carrier services  where we were experiencing relatively low gross margins and focused our activities in those sales channels  such as channel sales and distribution  that have generated relatively higher gross margins 
we significantly reduced our workforce and scaled back certain unprofitable services  including our sale of disposable calling cards and wholesale termination of telecommunications traffic 
service revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease  and the aggregate revenue decrease  was primarily due to the aforementioned restructuring 
product revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the factors noted above as well as the elimination of certain consumer distribution channels as we focused more on product sales through our channel sales and distribution unit 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination  the wholesale costs of internet telephony devices  ad serving costs and e mail box hosting fees 
it also includes the cost of purchasing  storing and shipping internet telephony equipment 
total direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased by percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal similarly  direct cost of service revenue decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  total direct costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal and direct cost of service revenue decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal these decreases are primarily attributable to the effective restructuring of our network for more focused and intensive use  aggressive price negotiations of termination costs and the impact of removing our subsidization of free minutes to strategic partners such as microsoft and yahoo 
the direct cost of product revenues increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of product revenue  excluding million and million of inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal years and  respectively  these costs increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the increase in direct costs as a percentage of product revenue is due to the emphasis of selling products through the channel sales and distribution unit to international distributors to increase significant volumes of traffic over our network rather than selling to domestic consumers for individual use 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  the expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales partners  advertising costs  travel  entertainment  referral fees and amounts paid to our strategic partners in connection with revenue sharing arrangements and the costs of insurance  legal  rent  utilities  shipping  consulting and other items 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a one time non recurring termination charge of million related to marketing and advertising expenses associated with the termination of our agreement with yahoo 
selling  general and administrative costs have decreased as a result of operating more efficiently and by leveraging our existing infrastructure to support future growth 
the portion of selling  general and administrative costs driven by payroll costs has decreased markedly during fiscal as the number of full time employees on staff dropped from on july  to on july  we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease in fiscal due to the restructurings of our operations that were announced in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a percent increase in capital equipment purchased during fiscal  to million  from million purchased during fiscal however  the overall increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal was mitigated by the impact of a million impairment of long lived assets recorded on april  as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal depreciation and amortization will decrease in fiscal as a direct result of the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets on april  restructuring  severance  impairment and other items 
restructuring  severance  impairment and other items increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the following table summarizes the charges included in restructuring  severance  impairment and other items in the statements of operations for the year ended july  impairment of long lived assets  exit costs   workforce reductions   ceo cfo separation agreements  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangible assets  cisco litigation related expense  other asset impairments   total   o impairment of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment of our long lived assets exists  we review the recorded value of such assets to determine if the future cash flows to be derived from these assets will be sufficient to recover the remaining recorded asset values 
we considered the resignations of the chief executive and chief financial officers earlier in the fiscal year and the plan to restructure our operations and eliminate various lines of development to be indicators of potential impairment 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal when it was determined that the future undiscounted cash flows of our long lived assets were estimated to be insufficient to recover their related carrying values 
as such  the carrying values of these assets were written down to our estimated fair value 
fair value was estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows

o litigation expenses on march  we filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against cisco systems  inc and a cisco executive who had been a member of the adir board of directors

in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the business combination 
accordingly  charges totaling million were recorded during fiscal as part of the allocation of the purchase price related to the acquisition of netspeak 
the ipr d relates primarily to advanced telephony software products for internet protocol ip networks 
the route server infrastructure product provides real time ip address resolution ensuring high performance  scalability and reliability

interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income primarily results from lower cash balances and interest rate reductions

in fiscal  services provided to idt and its affiliates accounted for percent of total revenue

the company does not have an interest in any off balance sheet financing vehicles 
we believe that  based upon our present business plan  our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  and to fund any potential operating cash flow deficits for at least the next twelve months 
if our growth exceeds current expectations or if we acquire the business or assets of another company  or if our operating cash flow deficit exceeds our expectations to the point that we cannot meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we will need to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our anticipated expansion  which could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations
