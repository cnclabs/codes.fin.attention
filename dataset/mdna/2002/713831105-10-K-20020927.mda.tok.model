item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future expenditures  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgements and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonable assured 
a provision for estimated future returns and other charges against revenue is recorded at the time of shipment 
approximately of our sales are to distributors 
we have agreements for price adjustment and stock rotation programs with our distributors 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgements and estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
we also may choose  at our discretion  to expand our price protection or stock rotation programs beyond our contractual obligations or previous estimates 
for example  in the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million against revenue to address inventory and pricing issues in our distribution channel that were due to the significant drop off in business activity that we had experienced 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period of time 
the reserve is reduced when product is sold or otherwise disposed of 
actual market conditions in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
the net change to inventory reserves in the fiscal year ended june  was an increase of approximately million 
investments 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted in fiscal we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of  and annual amortization of  that resulted from business combinations initialed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually 
we determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal  and we will continue to evaluate such goodwill at least annually 
we also made other investments in fiscal including bridge loans convertible to equity as well as direct equity investments 
these investments are included in other long term assets in the balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
overview pericom semiconductor corporation was incorporated in june we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits used for the transfer  routing  and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
since then we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others volt bit logic circuits and bit digital switches in fiscal  clock generators  volt clock synthesizers and buffers  and high speed interface products for the networking industry in fiscal  bit logic  bit digital switches and pentium  k modem and laser printer clock synthesizers in fiscal  an analog switch family  mixed voltage logic and a family of clock generators in fiscal  a family of advanced volt cmos logic  timing devices for pentium and pentium ii mobile computers  a complete solution for the pc memory module standard  and a volt bus switch family offering the fastest bus switches on the market in fiscal  three families of volt zero delay clock drivers for the networking and telecommunications markets  a family of application specific bus switches and integrated clock generators to support the latest intel processors and a complete interface solution for the pc memory module standard in fiscal  and a crossbar switch for backplane applications like server clusters  networking  industrial computing and storage area networks  a family of drivers  receivers  and transceivers supporting the low voltage differential signaling interface standard  the superclock programmable skew timing product family

in fiscal  advanced avc products that allow voltage shifting between volts and volts and i o translation from hstl to lvttl commonly needed between the latest state of the art asics and other legacy products  enhancements to its ddr memory module solutions  active termination clamp that help to clean up signaling overshoot common at fast clock rates  additional family of seven analog multiplexers and switches with improved performance and are used in a wide range of space constrained mobile and handheld computing applications  and a family of single  dual  and triple gate logic devices in extremely small packaging that address a very broad range of applications and systems requirements 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
we seek to increase unit sales volume through increased wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualification of new foundries  increased number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improved yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
in fiscal  and  respectively  approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products were manufactured by chartered 
we qualified ams as a wafer supplier in fiscal  njrc in fiscal  tsmc in fiscal  hyundai hynix in and peregrine semiconductor australia in fiscal declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economies of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to decrease unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing  and make in house test and assembly operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal  and net revenues 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues resulted primarily from the prolonged worldwide semiconductor industry downturn and a decline in the weighted average selling prices of our products 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net revenues resulted from overall strength in the semiconductor industry through the first six months of fiscal  continued market acceptance of our existing products and sales of new products in our siliconswitch  siliconclock and siliconinterface product lines  offset in part by a decline in the weighted average selling price of all products 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin resulted from decreases in the average selling prices of our various product lines and from under absorption of factory overhead due to reduced unit volumes 
these decreases were partially offset by cost reductions achieved through reduced wafer  assembly and test costs 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin resulted from the introduction and sale of new products at higher gross margins  a shift in mix towards a higher margin product line  and cost reductions achieved through reduced wafer  assembly and test costs 
these margin increases were partially offset by decreases in average selling prices in our various product lines 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development increased from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in research and development spending in each year was primarily attributable to development costs for new products in each of our product lines and  to a lesser extent  expansion of engineering staff and related infrastructure as we continued our commitment to new product 
table of contents development 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but increased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the expense decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels and decreases in commissions and other incentives resulting from the decline in sales and profitability 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of net revenues from to 
the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increased staffing levels and increases in commissions and other incentives due to sales and profitability growth 
restructuring charge 
in fiscal there was a non recurring restructuring charge of  related to an unused leased facility 
the facility has subsequently been subleased and the terms of that sublease indicate that the restructuring charge was sufficient to cover the net costs of the lease through the term of the sublease 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal or other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income and expense  investment write offs and our allocated portion of net losses of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china 
pti was formed by pericom and certain pericom shareholders in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries see note of notes to financial statements 
other income  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to declines in short term interest rates 
our share in the net losses of pti increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal as pti s losses increased due to the global semiconductor industry downturn 
in addition  we wrote off million in investments in fiscal no investments were written off in fiscal or other income  net increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of investment of the net proceeds from our follow on public offering in march our share of the net losses of pti decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  excluding  in goodwill amortization in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was million compared with a provision of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal income tax benefit was the result of the carry back of the fiscal net loss to prior fiscal years 
the provision for income taxes differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits and a change in the deferred asset valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided approximately million in cash in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the net loss of million for fiscal compared to net income of million for fiscal for fiscal our cash flows provided by operating activities were the result of the net loss of million offset by depreciation and amortization of million investment write offs of million  our share of the net loss of pti of million and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
net cash used for investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
financing activities provided approximately million in cash in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in each year  cash flows from financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock  net of issuance costs 
we made capital 
table of contents expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million to million on june  from million on june  the increase was primarily due to cash flows from operating activities and investment income 
in march of  we received million in net proceeds from a follow on public offering  which were invested in short term money market funds 
we believe that cash generated from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements  to fund our repurchase of common stock and to provide working capital at least through the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that adequate capital will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
as of september   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair market values of those derivative instruments would be accounted for depending on the use of instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas  as amended  on july  the adoption of this statement did not have an effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we had no derivative financial instruments as of june  and have not entered into any derivative transactions historically 
as a matter of policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we enter into such transactions in the future  we will account for those transactions in accordance with sfas  in which case we will formally document all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking such hedge transactions 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
business combinations originally accounted for under the pooling of interest method will not be changed 
adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
pericom adopted sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning july  on that date  we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of  at june  and annual amortization of  that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of sfas  business combinations 
we determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal we will continue to evaluate such goodwill at least annually

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we are currently in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
