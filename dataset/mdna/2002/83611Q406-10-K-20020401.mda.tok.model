item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements of soundview technology group  inc and subsidiaries and related notes thereto and item  selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies a summary of our accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in our view  the policies that involve the most subjective judgments are set forth below 
as of december   we hold approximately million in private equity investments and in investment funds in which the majority of the underlying investments are in privately held companies 
we carry our investments at fair value  with the accompanying gains and losses reflected in our results of operations 
the determination of fair value requires management to make estimates based on available information including the company s earnings  sales  operating developments and recent transactions in the company s securities 
our determination of fair value may not necessarily represent the amounts that might ultimately be realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be determined until the investments are actually liquidated 
we may recognize additional future losses related to our investment portfolio based on specific circumstances surrounding an individual investment or if market conditions decline further in certain sectors 
we record a loss reserve for our obligations under certain of our operating leases for unoccupied office space when estimated future sublease income is not expected to cover the lease obligation for the remainder of the lease term 
at december   we had recorded a loss reserve of million related to our lease commitment for an unused portion of our office space in san francisco  california 
thus far  we have been unsuccessful at negotiating a sublease for the space 
in march  as a result of the reduction in headcount  we have decided to further consolidate our office space to increase the likelihood of sublease for the unoccupied portion 
accordingly  at present  we may record an additional loss reserve in the first quarter of consisting of our lease commitment for the estimated time frame for sublease and the market loss on the additional unused office space over the life of the lease 
as we assess market conditions and other factors existing in regarding the demand for office space in new york  stamford and the uk  we will determine if additional adjustments to the loss reserve are necessary in relation to the planned subleases of our office space in those locations 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when these balances reverse 
future tax benefits attributable to temporary differences are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
as of december   we have recorded million in deferred tax assets related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards 
we have not established a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as management believes it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be utilized against future taxable income 
however if market conditions remain unfavorable and we continue to operate in a taxable loss position through fiscal  we will reassess the need for a valuation allowance against part or all of the deferred tax assets 
based on the balances of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at december   the valuation allowance would approximate million 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
the statement provides that assets which have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment and establishes specific guidelines for the testing of such assets 
sfas no 
allows for intangible assets with finite useful lives to continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but provides that those lives will no longer be limited to years 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  beginning in january  we will cease amortizing the remaining carrying value of the goodwill and tradename intangible assets related to the merger with stg  both of which have indefinite useful lives  and the amortization expense for these items will no longer be included in our computations of earnings per share 
the goodwill and tradename intangible assets  with carrying values at december  of million and million  respectively  are currently amortized at a rate of million annually 
as of december   we have not yet determined if we will incur any impairment charges resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
overview and business on january   wit capital group  inc completed a merger with soundview technology group  inc stg 
from june to august  the combined company operated as wit soundview group  inc and in august  the combined company changed its name to soundview technology group  inc all references to soundview  the company  us  our  and we refer to the combined company and its subsidiaries subsequent to january  all references to stg refer to operations of stg prior to its merger with wit capital group  inc soundview technology group  inc was incorporated on march  and commenced operations in september the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries  soundview technology corporation stc  formerly wit soundview corporation  wit capital corporation wcc  soundview technology group plc stge  formerly wit soundview europe group plc  soundview asset management  inc and soundview ventures corp 
formerly wit soundview ventures corp 
soundview is a research driven  technology focused investment banking firm 
soundview produces comprehensive sell side research on over technology companies 
our brokerage operations provide a variety of sales and trading services to institutional investors 
we leverage our technology expertise through a sales force which has a comprehensive understanding of the complex and diverse technologies involved in technology focused investing 
our investment banking services include public offerings  m a advisory and private equity placements 
our venture capital operation has established and currently manages a number of venture capital funds that provide investors with the opportunity to participate in technology and internet related investments 
current market environment as an investment banking firm  our business and operations are affected by the us and global economic environment and market conditions 
the trends in the equity markets  and in particular the market for technology companies  significantly influence the strength of our business operations 
we continue to operate under conditions that are unfavorable to potential public equity issuers  which commenced in and worsened in as a result of continuing uncertainty regarding the extent of the economic slowdown and the events of september  in  the markets have been affected by the concerns surrounding the collapse of the enron corporation in a way that has further slowed investment banking activity 
the events of september  resulted in the closure of the us stock markets for days during which time we earned no revenue from our brokerage operations 
however  once the markets reopened our brokerage revenue returned to levels we were experiencing in prior to september as a result of the continuing market uncertainty  it is not clear when the public equity markets will re open on terms acceptable to prospective technology issuers and when we will experience a related increase in revenue from public equity offerings 
we continue to advise on private equity financings as well as merger and acquisition activity  but are still experiencing a slowdown in these areas 
our results of operations prior to january   reflect only the results of wit capital group  inc predecessor to soundview technology group  inc 
as a result of the merger with stg on january   we believe that our results of operations from are not indicative of the results for any future period 
the financial information presented and discussed below and elsewhere in this document includes the results of the merger with stg beginning january   the closing date of that merger and the results of the merger with e offering corp 
e offering beginning october   the closing date of that merger 
additionally  on february   we acquired a controlling interest in stge through the purchase of additional shares of common stock 
accordingly  beginning on that date  the results of the operations of stge have been consolidated with ours 
results of operations for the years ended december    and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease in total reported revenues from to  primarily attributable to a decrease in investment banking revenue and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in brokerage revenue  write downs on private equity investments and a decrease in asset management fees 
comparing to  revenues increased primarily as a result of our merger with stg in january and the related contributions of its investment banking and institutional brokerage operations 
investment banking revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investment banking revenue is primarily derived from the public offering of equity securities  and also from mergers and acquisitions and strategic advisory services and private equity offerings 
the decrease in investment banking revenue in as compared to is attributable to unfavorable issuing conditions for technology companies  which includes lower market valuations and general market and economic uncertainty 
the increase in investment banking revenue from to is attributable to the merger with stg in january as well as increased economics in public offerings in which we participated in and an increased contribution from our mergers and acquisitions advisory services 
during we participated in a total of securities offerings  as co manager and as syndicate member  as compared with when we participated in public securities offerings  as co manager and as syndicate member 
in we participated in public securities offerings  as co manager and as syndicate member 
we participated in less offerings in compared with  but our level of investment banking revenue in reflects that we were typically receiving a lower economic percentage of the total revenue in those transactions 
for the year ended december   our mergers and acquisitions and financial advisory group advised on transactions with a combined value of over billion  compared with the year ended december  when we advised on mergers and acquisitions and financial advisory transactions with a combined value of over billion 
so long as the stability of the public equity markets remains uncertain and mergers and acquisitions activity remains slow  we do not expect that investment banking revenue will increase significantly from levels achieved in and could decrease from levels 
brokerage revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during  brokerage revenue is comprised solely of amounts attributable to our institutional brokerage operations compared to the year ended december  when our institutional operations contributed million  and we earned revenues from our retail online brokerage operations of million 
comparing to  and excluding commissions of approximately million earned on september  a day that we specifically earmarked for donation to the wtc relief efforts brokerage revenue related to our institutional operations decreased as a result of lower trading revenue derived from our market making operations 
as a result of the move to decimal trading in the nasdaq stock market  which began for all stocks in april  narrowing bid ask spreads and smaller price increments are being experienced and are resulting in a decrease in trading revenue earned from our market making operations 
to compensate for the narrowing of bid ask spreads  in april  we began charging commissions on certain nasdaq trades 
as more firms start charging commissions on nasdaq trades  we believe clients will be more willing to pay these commissions  and we believe these commissions will begin to offset the decrease we have experienced in this revenue 
comparing the year ended december  to  brokerage revenues increased  as a result of the contribution of our institutional brokerage operations  which became part of our operations as a result of our merger with stg in january  as compared with when all of our brokerage revenue was derived solely from our retail online brokerage operations 
interest and investment income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we earn interest income from the investment of cash balances raised through financing activities until the funds are used in our business 
our average monthly cash balance was million for compared to million in  and million in our interest and investment income decreased in from as a result of a lower average monthly cash balance and earning a lower interest rate on our interest bearing balances 
our interest and investment income increased from to  reflecting the positive cash contribution from our operating activities 
it is our current policy to pay bonuses and other compensation related payments to employees on a semi annual basis 
accordingly  our cash balance and the related interest income decreased once such payments were made subsequent to december  asset management fees for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  for  this revenue is derived primarily from management fees from our series of venture capital funds and from incentive royalties from hedge funds that were formerly managed by stg 
comparing asset management fees earned in the years ended december  and  the decrease in is attributable primarily to a reduction in the incentive royalties as well as the absence of syndication fees that were received in related to the organization of the dawntreader fund ii series of venture capital funds 
in   in management fee income was derived from the closing of wit vc fund i  lp in late  with which we commenced our venture capital operations 
in the future  we may establish new venture capital funds and are exploring new opportunities to apply our technology expertise in the asset management sector 
gain loss on investments for the year ended december  was a loss of million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  the increase in this loss primarily consists of losses from investment partnerships focused on the technology sector and a decline in the value of the company s contributions to leveraged employee investment funds 
as of december   we hold approximately million in private equity investments and in investment funds in which the underlying investments are in privately held companies 
we carry our investments at fair value  which requires management to make estimates based on available information  which do not necessarily represent the amounts that might ultimately be realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be determined until the investments are actually liquidated 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material 
we may recognize additional future losses related to our investment portfolio based on specific circumstances surrounding an individual investment or if market conditions decline further in certain sectors 
for the year ended december   the gain on investments represents the value of common stock warrants received from one client company for which we provided investment banking services 
other income for the year ended december  was compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  and income of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  other income consists of an adjustment to reduce estimated advertising revenue related to the sale of banner advertisements on our website

the decrease in compensation and benefits expense from to primarily relates to lower incentive compensation accrued on lower revenues and a decrease in personnel from as of december  to as of december  the increase in compensation and benefits expense from to primarily relates to an increase in headcount as of december  from to as of december  and increased incentive compensation accrued on a higher revenue base 
although our headcount has fluctuated during the past three years  the decrease in headcount in resulted primarily from staff reductions due to market conditions and the consolidation of our new york and stamford offices into one office location in old greenwich  connecticut 
the increase in our employee base during fiscal was attributable to the mergers with stg and e offering  offset by a reduction in staff employed in our online brokerage operations  which we discontinued in in march  management decreased the size of its combined us and us employee base to approximately employees as a result of the continued uncertainty surrounding the us and european economic environment 
compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  comparing with  the increase in compensation expense as a percentage of total revenues is primarily attributable to salary expense for employees  which represented of total revenues in as compared with in additionally  cash and stock based severance charges related to staff reductions in the year ended december   of million  accounted for of total revenues for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this expense relates to the amortization of intangible assets and goodwill related to mergers with stg and e offering 
the merger with stg  completed on january   resulted in approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill  which  during and  was expensed on a straight line basis over various periods ranging from to years 
the merger with e offering  which was completed on october   resulted in approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill  which  during  was amortized on a straight line basis over and years  respectively 
however  the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets related to the merger with e offering were reduced in june as a result of an impairment charge  discussed below 
the remaining intangible asset balance related to the strategic alliance between the company and e trade was reduced to zero in the third quarter of pursuant to a restructuring of the strategic alliance with e trade  which resulted in a return of stock previously issued to e trade 
accordingly our results of operations for the year ended december  include to months of amortization expense related to the e offering intangible assets and goodwill  in excess of the expense in as a result of the impairment charge discussed below and strategic alliance restructuring  as of december  the remaining balance of intangible assets and goodwill is all related to the merger with stg 
in january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets see new accounting pronouncements we will cease amortization of the goodwill and tradename intangible assets  with carrying values at december  of million and million  respectively  which are currently amortized at a rate of million annually 
accordingly  based on the balances and amortization period of the remaining amortizable intangible assets at december  and an additional write off of an intangible asset in march see note to the financial statements we expect amortization expense to decrease to approximately million on an annualized basis in as of december   we have not yet determined if we will incur any impairment charges resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
for the year ended december   impairment of intangible and other assets was million 
management reviews intangible and other assets whenever circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the second and third quarters of  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to our investment in wit capital japan based on our estimate of the total proceeds to be received upon the planned sale of our interest in the entity which was completed in november additionally  during june  in light of current economic environment and market conditions  we performed an evaluation of our enterprise value to make a determination as to whether the recorded amounts of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the mergers with stg and e offering were potentially impaired 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that an adjustment was required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets to their estimated fair value 
after evaluating the projected future cash flows related to the merger with e offering  it was determined that the goodwill and the strategic alliance agreement related to this merger were impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the charge was comprised of a write off of the carrying values of the goodwill and the strategic alliance agreement of million and million  respectively  based upon a valuation of discounted future cash flows  to adjust both assets to their estimated fair values 
brokerage and clearance expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this expense primarily consists of fees paid to independent floor brokers on the new york stock exchange for the execution of institutional customer agency trades  as well as amounts paid to our clearing broker for processing and clearing customers trades 
the decrease in brokerage and clearance expense for the year ended december  compared to december  resulted from decreased brokerage revenue and the elimination of expenses related to our online brokerage operations 
brokerage and clearance expense increased from to due to the addition of our institutional brokerage operations to our business as a result of the merger with stg

occupancy expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  occupancy expense includes costs related to leasing office space in old greenwich  new york  stamford  san francisco and london

the increase from to  was a result of adding an office in stamford as a result of the merger with stg and adding two additional  larger offices in san francisco as a result of the mergers with stg and e offering 
during  as we reduced headcount we took steps to consolidate our east coast operations into one location in old greenwich  connecticut as well as consolidate our space in san francisco

equity in net loss of affiliates and minority interest totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  equity in net loss of affiliates represents our proportional share of the losses incurred by wcj and stge prior to acquiring a controlling interest in stge in february based on our ownership interest in each entity 
minority interest in the earnings of stge represents recognition of the interest in that entity held by cazenove 
comparing with  equity in net loss of affiliates increased  as both entities had commenced limited operations in  as compared to  when both wcj and stge spent the majority of the year hiring staff  building an infrastructure and incurring other costs related to preparing to commence operations 
comparing to  this loss decreased as a result of incurring only nine months of losses related to our investment in wcj and as a result of acquiring an interest in stge in february  and therefore consolidating its results of operations with our own

our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate as a result of certain non deductible expenses  primarily goodwill  and state and local income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded million in deferred tax assets related primarily to net operating loss carryforwards 
we have not established a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as management believes it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be utilized against future taxable income 
however if market conditions remain unfavorable and we continue to operate in a taxable loss position through fiscal  we will reassess the need for a valuation allowance against part or all of the deferred tax assets 
based on the balances of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at december   the valuation allowance would approximate million

we carry our investments  approximately million as of december   at fair value which requires management to make estimates based on available information  which do not necessarily represent the amounts that might ultimately be realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be determined until the investments are actually liquidated 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary risk exposures are market risk particularly equity price  credit risk and legal risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of equity prices  interest rates or other factors could result in trading losses or negatively impact the market for equity issuance 
credit and legal risk refers to the risk that a counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual commitment resulting in our incurring losses 
our risk management focuses on the trading of securities  extension of credit to counterparties and investment banking activities  as well as the monitoring of trading levels with institutional customers 
we monitor these risks daily through a number of control procedures in order to identify and evaluate the various risks to which our company is exposed 
market risk we may act as a principal to facilitate customer related transactions in financial instruments  which exposes the firm to market risks 
we make markets in over equity securities 
to facilitate this business  we maintain securities inventories to facilitate customer transactions 
our management believes its practice of monitoring market risk very closely and we believe that our risk management results in a carefully controlled exposure to market volatility that should reduce our exposure to earnings volatility 
managing market risk exposure includes limiting firm commitments by position level both long and short for all securities traded and limiting the type of trades that can occur in each inventory account 
we seek to manage daily risk exposure in our inventory accounts by requiring various levels of management review of these accounts 
the primary purpose of risk management is to participate in the establishment of position limits  as well as to monitor both the buy and sell activity in the firm s trading accounts 
trading activities may result in the creation of inventory positions 
position and exposure reports indicating both long and short position are prepared  distributed and reviewed each day 
these reports enable us to monitor inventory levels  monitor daily trading results by stock and trader  as well as review inventory aging  pricing and concentration 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds and in enhanced income funds which include short term obligations issued by the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
our investments in enhanced income funds exposes us to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we have established investment guidelines that specify credit quality requirements as well as diversification requirements by issuer and type of security 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
credit risk our exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility that a counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual commitment  resulting in our incurring losses 
credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining possession and control of collateral which is accomplished with established arrangements with the clearing broker 
along with our clearing broker  we manage the credit exposure relating to our trading activities by monitoring the credit worthiness of counterparties requesting additional collateral when deemed necessary and limiting the amount and duration of exposure to individual counterparties 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
we have established legal standards and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
we have also established procedures that are designed to monitor compliance with senior management s policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices 
in connection with our business  we have various procedures that address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  trading and sales practices  supervision  and record keeping 
we have also established certain procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable  including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity  adequacy or legal documentation  the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies
