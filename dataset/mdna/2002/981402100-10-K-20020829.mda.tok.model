overview we are a leading provider of human capital management hcm services 
we offer a combination of high tech and high touch services  giving customers the ability to manage their complete recruiting and outplacement needs on a single workstream platform 
there have been significant changes in our business during the twelve month period ended may  fiscal 
during the first six months of fiscal we completed the acquisition of paula allen associates  omnipartners  figuresjobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
during the third and fourth quarters  the company has focused on integrating the acquired entities and expanding the reach of the existing business 
these acquisitions increased the service offerings and revenue streams for the company 
due to the substantive change these acquisitions have made to our business  this management s discussion and analysis includes comparisons of pro forma results of operations for and these pro forma results assume that the above acquisitions had been completed as at june  and therefore compare revenues and expenses of the company and all its subsidiaries for both fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s most critical accounting policies relate to the assessment of goodwill impairment  impairments in intangible assets and the valuation of net deferred tax assets 
management applies judgement to value these assets 
changes in assumptions used would impact the financial results of the company 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on a annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
the company assesses goodwill by comparing the carrying value of goodwill to the estimated future cash flows over a five year period and discounts these cash flows back to a present value  using a discount rate 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
the company values intangible assets  such as a customer base acquired in an acquisition  based on estimated future income applying historical customer retention rates 
if the customer base acquired discontinues using the company s service earlier than historical experience  the company may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
the company applies significant judgement in recording net deferred tax assets  which result from the loss carry forwards of companies that it acquires 
the recording of deferred tax assets requires estimates of future profits from the acquired company to be forecast 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated 
the table below represents pro forma results  assuming all fiscal acquisitions were acquired at the beginning of the periods reflected

our recruiting research revenues have declined on a pro forma basis for fiscal due primarily to the overall economic slowdown  while career transition and enterprise sales revenues have increased for the same period 
the decline in recruiting research revenues at omnipartners has required us to reduce certain costs to improve profitability in the recruiting segment 
following completion of the acquisitions in fiscal  we began working to expand our market reach  most notably through the addition of offices of paula allen holdings 
we have also been reducing costs by consolidating operations  resulting in staff reductions of redundant positions and related overhead and significantly reducing research and development expenditures 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for the year ended may  compared to  for the year ended may  fiscal 
fiscal revenues from companies we acquired during fiscal represented  for the year ended may  revenues other than from companies we acquired in fiscal declined to  from  in fiscal as a result of discontinuing the e cruiter express product 
the e cruiter express product serviced companies with under employees 
we discontinued that product in an effort to focus more resources on companies with more than employees 
pro forma revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal pro forma revenues include the revenues of all acquired companies for the full reporting periods  instead of from their acquisition dates 
pro forma revenues declined primarily due to a decrease in recruitment research revenues realized by omnipartners 
the decline in omnipartners revenues was due to a general economic slowdown causing companies to refrain from adding employees during calendar which continued into the first half of career transition service revenues for fiscal were  and were the largest contributor to total revenues in fiscal all of the revenue in this segment is attributable to the acquisition of paula allen holdings  acquired in july of fiscal and the addition of new offices during fiscal pro forma revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the primary reason for the increase was due to the opening of new offices for paula allen holdings during fiscal enterprise recruiting revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of rezlogic inc  omnipartners and figurejobs 
com inc 
in fiscal pro forma revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the primary reason for the decline was a million decline in recruitment research revenues at omnipartners  due to the economic slow down 
enterprise recruiting revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal on a pro forma basis primarily due to an increase in new customer contracts from figurejobs 
we believe that the fiscal acquisitions and the subsequent acquisitions of icarian and purecarbon will have a positive impact on future revenues by allowing us to deliver a broader range of recruiting and outplacement products and services through our offices across north america 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal while the total cost of revenues has increased significantly due to the recent acquisitions  as a percentage of revenue these costs have declined from approximately for fiscal to for this fiscal year 
cost of revenues includes the cost of network operations  client support and charges related to third party services 
the decline as a percentage of revenue is due to the recent acquisitions lower cost of delivery of products and services and our ability to consolidate technology 
career transition cost of revenues accounted for  and enterprise recruiting cost of revenues accounted for  of the total cost for fiscal on a pro forma basis  cost of revenues decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal since the consummation of the acquisitions  management has proceeded with the consolidation of certain cost centers and the elimination of redundant operations 
this has resulted in a decrease compared to the pro forma cost of revenues for fiscal gross profits consolidated gross profits were  for fiscal or of revenues compared to  or for fiscal the significant increase in gross profits is due to the above mentioned acquisitions 
we believe that these margins can be maintained  since the newly acquired service lines involve a significantly lower cost of delivery 
career transition services gross profit was  or of career transition services revenues for fiscal and enterprise recruiting gross profit represented  or approximately of enterprise recruiting service revenues for fiscal pro forma gross profits were  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal the consolidation of third party support costs was the major contributor to the increased percentage in pro forma gross profit 
operating expenses total operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the recent acquisitions accounted for  in total operating expenses 
operating expenses for non acquired operations were  for fiscal  representing an approximately decline compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decline in operating expenses for the operations that existed prior to the fiscal acquisitions is the consolidation of operating functions and technology 
on a pro forma basis  operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the primary reason for the reduction in operating expenses is the elimination of redundant expenses from the recent acquisitions 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase is attributed to the above mentioned acquisitions 
commission expense is approximately of the total selling and marketing expense and commission expense is expected to increase at the same rate as revenues grow 
on a pro forma basis  selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decline in selling and marketing expenses was due to the elimination of some redundant staff positions and marketing programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  reflecting increased costs related to the companies we acquired during  which we believe will be partially reduced in the future by continued consolidation of some administrative functions 
on a pro forma basis  general and administrative expenses decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease is due to the elimination of redundant functions across the acquired organizations since consummation of the acquisitions 
research and development research and development costs were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decline is primarily due to the completion of various projects under development in prior periods and our strategy to acquire technology through acquisition 
we believe that we can acquire new technology at a lower cost and more efficiently than developing new software platforms with internal resources 
this strategy was implemented in fiscal and it was not the same strategy as in the past 
most of our current research and development efforts are incurred in the enterprise recruiting division 
on a pro forma basis  research and development expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal amortization expense amortization expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  with the amortization of acquired intangible assets representing the entire increase over the prior year 
on a pro forma basis  amortization expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal interest income interest and other income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the significant decline was due to the decline in short term investments 
short term investments as of may  were  compared to  at may   which represented the remaining capital raised from our public offering in december interest and other expense interest and other expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in interest and other expense was due to the increase in both short and long term debt 
as of may  short and long term debt totaled  compared to  at may  the primarily reason for the increase was a result of the fiscal acquisitions and the expansion of operating units 
during fiscal  we recorded  of interest expense relating to our convertible notes issued in april and may of future period interest expense related to the convertible notes will increase significantly as the notes accrete to their face value of million over their year term to maturity 
goodwill goodwill was  as of may  compared to nil as of may  the goodwill relates to the acquisitions completed during fiscal and includes adjustments during the year for shares released from escrow to the former owners of paula allen holdings inc  as we achieved the specific revenue and profit targets set by the paula allen holdings acquisition agreement for the period ended december  additionally  management recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling  during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for fiscal increased to  compared with revenues of  for the year ended may  fiscal 
the growth in revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales in the third and fourth quarters  due to the increase of new client contracts 
cost of revenues cost of revenue includes costs of network operations  client support and charges relating to third party services 
cost of revenue in fiscal increased to  compared with  in fiscal costs relating to our network operations increased to  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation costs relating to our investment in network infrastructure and capacity 
our live site is now hosted in a state of the art facility with full environmental controls and redundancies  and a complete microsoft 
net underpinning infrastructure 
the higher costs also reflect increased salaries relating to an increase in personnel in our network center 
client support costs increased to  for fiscal  compared with  for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in our support staff as we added more resources in anticipation of increased business volume in the latter half of fiscal  resulting from a distribution agreement with adp canada 
however  this agreement did not generate the level of revenue that we originally anticipated  and the support staff was accordingly reduced toward the end of fiscal charges by third party service partners  whose products are made available to clients via the e cruiter software  increased to  for fiscal  compared with  in fiscal these third party products include postings to internet job boards  reference and background checks  and candidate assessment tools 
gross profits consolidated gross profits were  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal the significant improvement in the gross profit percentage is due to the lower cost of revenues contributed by the acquired service lines in fiscal the overall improvement of our gross margins in fiscal was primarily due to the investments we made in the past to develop a highly scalable infrastructure able to support a significant increase in volume 
as a result  the increased revenues in fiscal did not result in a proportional increase in cost of revenues 
operating expenses total expenses increased to  for fiscal  compared with  for year in january  we relocated to a new facility in ottawa formerly kanata  ontario 
this relocation enabled us to bring our entire team in one location  and provided us with the capacity for future growth 
the new facility resulted in an increase of  in amortization expense  as leasehold improvements from the legacy locations were written off and leaseholds relating to the new location were amortized 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased to  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal marketing expenses decreased to  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal following our initial public offering in december  significant efforts were made to develop brand name recognition in the canadian marketplace 
these efforts were reduced to a maintenance mode throughout fiscal the decline in marketing was partially off set by an increase of  or in selling expense 
the increase was attributable primarily to increased salaries as we expanded our direct sales force 
the increase in the number of contracts also resulted in a higher commission expense 
in addition  expansion into the calgary  vancouver and montreal markets resulted in a significant increase in facilities related costs for our sales force 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the primary reason for the decline in general and administrative expenses was due the decline of approximately  in compensation expense related to stock option grants 
research and development research and development expenses increased to  for fiscal  compared with  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of our research and development capability  hiring additional personnel according to needs and engaging outside consultants for specific projects 
the increase in research and development expenses also reflected amortization costs resulting from our investment in additional capital resources for the research and development group 
amortization expense for fiscal  amortization expense was  compared to  for fiscal this increase was reflective of the additional expenditures in development tools and equipment 
interest income other income and interest income for fiscal was  and included foreign exchange gains on us cash holdings of  and a gain on disposal of fixed assets of  in fiscal  interest income was  the decline in interest income was due to the decline in excess cash being invested as a result of funding current year losses 
liquidity and capital resources at may   we had  in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and a working capital deficit of  we have made a significant investment in acquiring new service lines which has reduced available cash and increased long term debt 
furthermore  capital requirements have exceeded cash flows from operations in fiscal at may    of short term investment balances were restricted from use because they were collateral for various borrowing or leasing arrangements 
merchant banks have required us to place reserve deposits on our merchant accounts due to the high volume of credit card usage by our clients 
as of may   approximately  was held by such banks 
these deposits will be reviewed quarterly and may be returned to us based on activity surrounding credits issued 
additional deposits of  are restricted by two banks as security for an outstanding term loan  lines of credit and a letter of guarantee provided to a landlord for a facility lease 
these restricted cash balances will be reduced annually for rent payments and any repayments on lines of credit 
for fiscal  cash used in operations totaled  consisting primarily of the net loss for the year of  offset by non cash expenses such as amortization  non cash compensation and impairment write down of goodwill 
the net change in operating components of working capital for fiscal was  primarily due to the increase in current liabilities partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable from the companies we acquired in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was  the sale of certain short term investments resulted in cash inflows of  in fiscal  we expended a total of  on acquisitions 
an additional  was expended for capital assets as we improved our network infrastructure and integrated the technology platforms of the acquired companies to improve internal communications and efficiencies 
in april and may  we raised additional capital by issuing sands brothers venture capital iii llc  crestview capital fund  lp and their respective affiliated entities an aggregate of  principal amount of our senior subordinated convertible notes and warrants to purchase  of our common shares at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
the notes will be convertible into a class of preferred shares known as class a preferred shares  which have yet to be authorized 
the authorization of the proposed class a preferred shares will be submitted to our shareholders for approval at the next shareholders meeting 
the conversion price of the notes into class a preferred shares is per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
the class a preferred shares  if approved by our shareholders and when issued  would be convertible into a number of common shares determined by dividing by a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
at the election of the holder  the notes may be converted directly into our common shares  provided that a registration statement registering such common shares has been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission prior to such conversion  at a conversion price equal to a discount of the average closing price of our common shares the five day period before such conversion 
the proceeds from the sale of these securities are being used for general working capital purposes 
net cash generated by financing activities was  for fiscal financing outflows consisted primarily of the repayment of bank debt of  and the repayment of a loan to a shareholder of an acquired company of  our chief executive officer has provided us with  in short term loans to offset the negative cash flow created by the new credit card deposit requirements 
in addition  our chief executive officer provided  to establish a new line of credit with the bank of montreal 
on a net basis  we have also drawn an additional  on existing bank facilities for the year ended may  we have had operating losses since our inception and had negative cash flow from operations for fiscal however  the elimination of redundancies in the acquired companies  the consolidation of on going operations and reductions in research and development efforts previously discussed  have reduced the monthly negative cash flows over the current fiscal year 
we believe that these changes  along with further consolidation of cost centers and elimination of redundancies  will result in cash flows from operations which  together with current cash reserves and credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least may  acquisitions we constantly endeavor to increase our share of  and strengthen our position in  the hcm market 
a key component of our business strategy is to continue to acquire companies offering services similar or complementary to ours 
the hcm market has experienced significant consolidation in the last several months as companies attempt to expand their service offerings and broaden their revenue bases to achieve rapid growth and profitability 
by implementing our business strategy and identifying the consolidation trend in its relatively early stages  we believe we have been able to complete acquisitions of several companies 
as a result of the acquisitions in  we recorded a deferred tax asset which represents the amount of income tax loss carryforward that will be used to offset future taxable income 
we have also recorded a deferred tax liability which represents the timing difference between tax and financial statement recognition of amortization of intangibles acquired 
risk factors you should consider the following risk factors that pertain to our company 
the realization of these risks could result in a significant adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  business or the market for our common shares 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks or address them on a continuing basis 
keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in item 
we may not become profitable 
since our inception  we have incurred losses which have been substantial in relation to our operations 
as of may   the end of our most recent fiscal year  we had an accumulated deficit of  we reported a net loss of  for the year ended may  prior to our fiscal acquisitions we generated relatively small amounts of revenue 
during the first six months of fiscal we acquired all of the outstanding shares of four companies  three of whom reported in the aggregate net losses of approximately million in their immediately preceding fiscal years 
if we continue to acquire companies reporting losses  if revenue grows slower than we anticipate or if operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not become profitable 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability would materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to grow as we expand our operations 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
during the first six months of fiscal  we made several investments in  and acquisitions of  other companies and businesses  as part of efforts to expand our operations and we may continue to make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary companies  products and businesses 
if we acquire a company  we may have difficulty integrating that company s personnel  operations and products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate in a timely manner or at all these acquired companies into our operations 
these difficulties may increase our expenses  and our profitability may be adversely affected resolutions may be influenced by a limited number of shareholders 
we are controlled by our two major shareholders  paul champagne and michael mullarkey  which together  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common shares  not including  common shares currently held in escrow  to be released to mr 
mullarkey upon the achievement of certain profit and revenue targets specified in the acquisition agreement of pah 
these major shareholders are also parties to a voting agreement 
the voting agreement governs the voting of our two major shareholders on various issues including  the disposition of our corporate assets  payment of dividends  issuance of additional shares  change in the nature of our business  amendment to our articles of incorporation  change in the number of directors and any amalgamation  reorganization  liquidation or any other fundamental corporate change 
consequently  our two major shareholders may influence the outcome of various actions that require shareholder approval  including the election of our directors  delaying or preventing a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares and preventing changes in control or management 
the current economic downturn and future economic downturns may adversely affect the demand for our services 
historically  the general level of economic activity has significantly affected the demand for employment and recruitment services 
we believe that we are currently experiencing the effects of the current economic downturn and as a result the demand for our employment and recruitment services has decreased 
if the general level of economic activity continues to slow  our clients may not require additional personnel and may delay or cancel plans that involve recruiting new personnel using our services and technology 
consequently  our sales cycle could increase and the demand for our services could decline  resulting in a loss of revenue harming our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is expected that in times of economic growth  demand for our outplacement business may decline 
we may not be able to grow our client base and revenue because of the number of competitors and the variety of sources of competition we face 
our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to grow and maintain our client base and revenue 
this requires that we offer services that are superior to the services being offered by our competitors and that we price our services competitively 
we compete for a portion of employers recruiting budgets with many types of competitors  as employers typically utilize a variety of sources for recruiting  including o traditional offline recruiting firms  o traditional offline advertising  such as print media  o resume processing companies  o web based recruitment companies  o internet job posting companies  and o client server based software services 
in addition  many employers are developing or may develop their own software to satisfy their recruitment needs 
if we are unable to grow our client base and revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the increasing competition in our markets could affect our ability to expand 
the market for human capital management or hcm services is highly fragmented and competitive 
we compete nationally and internationally with internet recruitment services companies  outplacement service companies and human resource  or hr service providers 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future  with increased price competition developing for our services 
a number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and marketing resources and name recognition than we do which could give them a competitive advantage 
our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result  we may not be able to expand or maintain our market share and our ability to penetrate new markets may be adversely affected 
if we experience client attrition  our operating results will be adversely affected 
since we generally enter into subscription agreements with our e cruiter enterprise clients for terms of one year or less  we have no assurance that the client will maintain a long term relationship with us 
if we lose clients after the expiration of their initial subscription  our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
since we have only been offering our services for a limited period of time  we do not know what rate of client attrition to expect 
to the extent we experience significant client attrition  we must attract additional clients to maintain revenue 
we may not be able to strengthen and maintain awareness of our brand name 
we believe that our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully develop  strengthen and maintain our brand recognition and reputation 
in order to strengthen and maintain our brand recognition and reputation  we invest and will need to continue to invest substantial resources in our marketing efforts and maintain high standards for actual and perceived quality  usefulness  reliability  security and ease of use of our services 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand name  particularly after incurring significant expenses in promoting our brand name  or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common shares could decline 
moreover  even if we continue to provide quality service to our clients  factors outside of our control  including actions by organizations that are mistaken for us and factors generally affecting our industry  could affect our brand and the perceived quality of our services 
our success will depend on our ability to enter into strategic relationships with job posting and other on line recruitment services to offer an attractive service to our clients and with a variety of third parties to expand the distribution of our services 
if we are unable to enter into successful strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
we must maintain our existing relationships with job posting boards and other on line recruitment services and enter into additional similar relationships to continue to offer an attractive service 
we also must enter into arrangements with third parties  such as value added service providers  to expand the distribution of our services 
because many of these third parties compete with each other  the existence of a relationship with any particular third party may limit or preclude us from entering into a relationship with that third party s competitors 
in addition  some of the third parties with which we seek to enter into relationships may view us as a competitor and refuse to do business with us 
any loss of an existing relationship or failure to establish new relationships may adversely affect our ability to improve our services  offer an attractive service in the new markets that we enter  or expand the distribution of our services 
we may not be able to expand our business successfully into new geographic markets 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we marketed our services primarily in canada 
since that time we completed several acquisition transactions 
through these acquisition transactions we endeavored to enhance our business by penetrating the united states market 
our success and ability to grow our business will depend to a significant degree on our ability to market our services successfully in new geographic markets  including the united states 
penetrating new geographic markets involves the expenditure of substantial resources  including retaining additional highly qualified personnel 
failure to effectively penetrate new geographical markets may result in increasing losses and the loss of our investment  in whole or in part  in our acquisitions 
this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose business if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  services and features 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  services  or enhancements to  or new features for  existing services  in a timely and successful manner  we may lose sales opportunities 
the market for our services is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements  the introduction of new products and services  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
the adoption of new technologies or new industry standards may render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
the process of developing new services or technologies is complex and requires significant continuing efforts 
we may experience difficulties or funding shortages that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of enhancements or new products and services 
moreover  new products  services or features which we introduce may not adequately address the needs of the marketplace or achieve significant market acceptance 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including our ability to grow our revenue 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital and investments to fund our working capital requirements  anticipated operating cash flow deficit and capital expenditure requirements to at least the end of the fiscal however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected in order to fund expansion  develop new  and enhance existing  services or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
future financing may be on terms adverse to your interests 
if  in the future  we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and holders of those new securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common shares 
if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company  our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
we believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes for the fiscal and generally  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes if for any taxable year of our gross income is passive income  or at least of our assets are held for the production of  or produce  passive income 
this characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to our shareholders 
these consequences may include having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income  rather than capital gain income  and having potentially punitive interest charges apply to the proceeds of share sales 
us shareholders should consult with their own us tax advisors with respect to the us tax consequences of investing in our common shares 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technologies and brand names 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could provide third parties with access to our technologies without payment 
if this were to occur  our proprietary technologies would lose value and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  however  may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or protect us if misappropriation occurs 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because of the global nature of the internet 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
third parties could claim that we infringe upon their proprietary technologies 
our products  services  content and brand names may be found to infringe valid copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in the event of a successful infringement claim against us and our failure or inability to modify our technologies or services  develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  we may not be able to offer our services 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements  modify our technologies or services or prevent us from using important technologies or services  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation which could increase our costs of doing business  restrict our activities and or subject us to liability 
uncertainty and new regulations relating to the internet could increase our costs of doing business  prevent us from providing our services  slow the growth of the internet or subject us to liability  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and prospects 
in addition to new laws and regulations being adopted  existing laws may be applied to the internet 
there are currently few laws and regulations directly governing access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and continues to change 
new and existing laws may cover issues which include o user privacy  o pricing controls  o consumer protection  o libel and defamation  o copyright and trademark protection  o characteristics and quality of services  o sales and other taxes  and o other claims based on the nature and control of internet materials 
computer viruses or software errors may disrupt our operations  subject us to a risk of loss and or expose us to liability 
computer viruses may cause our systems to incur delays or other service interruptions 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or software errors in new services or products not detected until after their release could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
moreover  if a computer virus affecting our system is highly publicized or if errors are detected in our software after it is released  our reputation and brand name could be materially damaged and we could lose clients 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of system failures 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures 
our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
we have experienced minor system interruptions in the past  and we believe that system interruptions will continue to occur from time to time in the future 
if we are unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  we could experience unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times 
any catastrophic failure at our network operations center could prevent us from serving our clients for a number of days  or possibly weeks  and any failure of our internet service provider may adversely affect our network s performance 
our clients may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them or results in slower response times 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our system or interruptions in our services 
breaches of our network security could be costly 
if unauthorized persons penetrate our network security  they could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we may be required to spend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems 
in addition  because we host data for our clients  we may be liable to any of those clients that experience losses due to our security failures 
as a result  security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common shares may decline 
our business depends on internet service providers to provide satisfactory service to our clients to enable them to use our services and access job seeker candidates on line 
failure of internet service providers or on line service providers to provide access to the internet to our clients and job seekers would prevent them from accessing our web board  which would cause our business to suffer 
many of the internet service providers  on line service providers and other web site operators on which we depend have experienced significant service slowdowns  malfunctions  outages and capacity limitations 
if users experience difficulties using our services due to the fault of third parties  our reputation and brand name could be harmed 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  greater frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users 
in the past  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays 
any future outages or delays could affect the willingness of employers to use our on line recruitment offerings and of job seekers to post their resumes on the internet 
if any of these events occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the existence of registration rights could depress the market for our common shares 
we have granted registration rights to holders of approximately  common shares  warrants exercisable for approximately  common shares and notes convertible into approximately  common shares 
certain holders of registration rights have the right to demand that we register their common shares 
as a result  we may be obligated to file one or more registration statements registering additional common shares if the holders of demand registration rights elect to exercise their demand rights 
any registration statement that we file within the five year period beginning january   including registration statements filed as a result of certain security holders exercising their demand registration rights  may trigger the registration of these shares with the securities and exchange commission  subject to certain restrictions 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that the sale of these additional securities or the availability of these additional securities for sale will have on the market prices of our common shares prevailing from time to time 
the price of our common shares historically has been volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell our common shares when you want at prices you find attractive 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile in the past  and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  since june   the closing sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq small cap market has fluctuated between and per share 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common shares o quarterly variations in our results of operations  o announcement of new products  product enhancements  joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us  o technological innovations by our competitors or us  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common shares  regardless of our operating performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and our bank loans 
we invest our surplus cash in an investment trust established by a canadian chartered bank  and in a certificate of deposit in a bank in the united states 
the investment trust holds various short term  low risk instruments  and can be withdrawn without penalty at any time 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial position

at may  we had drawn  on the line of credit 
we also have a term loan with the bank in the amount of  as of may  the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
a letter of credit was issued in may as collateral on leased facilities in the amount of  that will renew annually 
we pay an annual fee of on this letter of credit 
the majority of our interest rates are fixed  therefore we have limited exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended may  would have been less than  foreign currency risk we have monetary assets and liabilities balances denominated in canadian dollars
