item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to our customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue from sales of infoworkspace software licenses and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the subscription contract periods 
products and software licenses are sold without any contractual right of return to the customer 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 
at december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of approximately thousand 
we believe our reported allowances are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances  which would result in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves as a designer  developer and manufacturer of real time collaboration solutions  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
at december   our inventory of million is stated net of inventory reserves of approximately million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorate or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
impairment the company reviews the carrying values of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for an asset to be held and used is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
the fair value of long lived assets is generally based on estimated future cash flows from operations 
the estimates reflect the company s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume levels  costs and market conditions over the estimated remaining operating period  which generally ranges from one to five years 
if the company s assumptions related to assets to be held and used are inaccurate  additional write downs may be required in the future 
product warranties our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at the time of sale at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements 
we believe that our recorded liability at december   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures  or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue was principally related to a significant decline in sales of isdn products and related service revenues as the videoconferencing market continued to weaken 
in particular  sales of isdn products and related services to two of the company s largest customers  picturetel corporation and vtel corporation  were significantly lower than in the year ended december  isdn product revenue from picturetel was million in compared to million in isdn product revenue from vtel was 
million in compared to million in in addition to the decline in sales of isdn products and services  the overall decrease in revenue is also attributable to the sale of the company s network access card nac product line in september revenue from the sales of nac products approximated million during the year ended december  these decreases were offset by million of revenue associated with the company s infoworkspace product line acquired in march revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily related to the beginning of the decline in sales of isdn products and related service revenues as the videoconferencing market started to weaken 
in particular isdn product revenue from sales to picturetel decreased to million in from million in isdn product revenue from sales to vtel decreased to million in from million in revenue from the sales of nac products decreased by million in  as compared to  attributable in part to the sale of the nac product line in september gross profit cost of revenues includes material costs  manufacturing labor and overhead and customer support costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased in to from in and in reduction in margin for each of the last two years was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in revenues and the related disproportionate effect of fixed manufacturing and service cost included in cost of revenues 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the company s spending decrease was partially attributable to the elimination of engineering expenses of approximately million related to the nac product line sold in september approximately million of the decrease is attributable to a reduction in staff and related expenses due to completion of various projects and the company s restructuring and cost reduction plan implemented in may offset by increased costs of approximately million associated with the acquisition of infoworkspace in march research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decline in network access card product related expenses of 
million and completion of engineering projects 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decreased spending was primarily due to the company s restructuring and cost reduction plan that went into effect at the end of may cost savings achieved from the restructuring and cost reduction plan were offset by added sales and marketing expenses of approximately million attributable to the infoworkspace product line acquired in march sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decreased spending was primarily due to the transition from an isdn product focus to a concentration on ip and internet products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to cost savings associated with the restructuring and cost reduction plan implemented in may general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to reduction of expenditures related to the company s corporate wide financial accounting  manufacturing and sales and distribution system  which was implemented during occupancy and other facilities related expenses occupancy and other facilities related expenses represent rent expense and other operating costs associated with the company s headquarters and manufacturing facility in burlington  massachusetts and various other sales and development offices in the united states  united kingdom  hong kong and china 
costs are essentially fixed and generally only change when new offices are opened or leases are renegotiated 
the increase to million in from million in relates primarily to added occupancy costs associated with the acquisition of the infoworkspace product line in march interest income  net interest income  net  consists of interest on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased to approximately 
million in from million in interest income in was million 
the decrease in was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash available for investment 
the increase in was primarily related to higher rates of return on investments 
income tax the amount reported as income tax benefit in relates primarily to the reversal of tax reserves recorded in prior years 
the company determined that the tax reserves were no longer required because the related potential tax exposures were favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of in the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets recorded in prior years to zero and thousand related to the settlement of litigation with accord 
litigation on june   the company settled its patent infringement suit against accord in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts

the company received  at the time the agreement was signed and by december  received an additional  the final  is being held in escrow until certain tax matters related to the settlement are resolved with tax authorities in israel 
factors which may affect future operations this annual report includes discussions of its long term growth outlook  including various forward looking statements 
the following risks and uncertainties  among others  could affect the degree to which such expectations are realized 
liquidity 
as further described under liquidity and capital resources  the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital  increase revenue or substantially improve operating margins 
dependence on major customers 
while the company is focusing efforts on broadening its reseller  distribution and oem sales channels  sales to a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenue 
the company believes that its dependence on a relatively small number of customers will continue during this concentration of customers may cause revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on major customers requirements and the timing of their orders and shipments 
the company s agreements with its customers generally do not include minimum purchase commitments or exclusivity arrangements 
the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if any present or future major customer were to choose to reduce its level of orders  were to change to another vendor for purchases of a similar product  were to combine their operations with another company who had an established relationship with another vendor for purchases of a similar product  were to experience financial  operational or other difficulties or were to delay paying or fail to pay amounts due the company 
reduced demand for traditional videoconferencing products 
traditional videoconferencing technology such as isdn has had a rapid decline 
the company s isdn revenue declined to million in from million in the company has broadened its product offerings with the acquisition of the infoworkspace product line in march and continues to develop and sell ip based products 
to date  however  revenues from sales of these products has not offset the decline in revenues from sales of traditional isdn based videoconferencing products 
evolving markets 
sales of real time collaboration products account for an increasing portion of the company s revenue 
the company s success depends  to a significant extent  on the acceptance and the rate of adoption of ip and internet based collaboration products  in general  and encounter and infoworkspace products in particular 
there is inadequate experience to predict whether real time collaboration products will ultimately be accepted by the market 
there can be no assurance that any of the markets for the company s products will develop to the extent  in the manner  or at the rate anticipated by the company 
in addition  future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease as a result of new product introductions by others  price competition  technological change or other factors 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging network architectures and frequent new product introductions 
the adoption rate of new technologies and products may adversely impact near term growth of the conferencing market as users evaluate the alternatives 
the company has invested  and for plans to continue to invest  in product development and products incorporating certain of these new technologies 
many other companies are also developing products incorporating these new technologies that are competitive with the company s current and future offerings 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability through continued investments to maintain technological leadership  to enhance and expand its existing product offerings and to select and develop in a timely manner new products that achieve market acceptance 
competition 
the market for multimedia collaboration products is highly competitive 
the company expects competition to increase significantly in the future 
a number of companies have introduced or announced their intention to introduce products that could be competitive with the company s products  and the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which the company competes may attract other new entrants as they perceive opportunities 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources 
if the company is unable to convince companies with collaboration and videoconferencing needs to adopt the encounter and infoworkspace collaboration products over the current technologies marketed by competitors  the company s financial results will suffer  through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the market for multimedia collaboration are  and should continue to be  breadth of capabilities  demonstrated interoperability  price  performance  network management capabilities  reliability  customer support and security 
the company plans to compete by offering collaboration and enterprise products with a broad range of capabilities and high performance 
however  the company cannot be certain that potential customers will be attracted to the company s products  especially if competitors were to invest substantially more money into their products and technology 
infoworkspace acquisition 
on march   the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the operating assets and intellectual property of the infoworkspace  a business unit of general dynamics electronic systems 
the company entered into the purchase agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in certain benefits including  among other things  benefits relating to expanded and complementary product offerings  enhanced revenues  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of engineering personnel 
infoworkspace products are currently used primarily by government organizations  including the department of defense and the intelligence community 
while continuing to develop the government business  the company s intention is to market and sell the infoworkspace collaboration products commercially 
the company cannot assure that its commercial marketing efforts will be sufficient or that its businesses will achieve revenues  specific net income or loss levels  efficiencies or synergies that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings in any future period 
infoworkspace products provide knowledge workers a secure virtual workspace for project and team collaboration 
infoworkspace products are currently used primarily by government organizations  including defense department agencies and the intelligence community 
protection of proprietary technology 
the company s success depends  to a large extent  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company currently holds ten us patents  two corresponding patents in foreign jurisdictions and has several patent applications pending 
in addition to its patents  the company relies primarily on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyrights to protect its intellectual property rights 
retention of key employees 
the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the continuing contributions of its key management  sales  marketing and research and development personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace  including khoa nguyen  the company s chief executive officer 
the company does not have employment contracts with its key personnel other than khoa nguyen 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain such key employees 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million  which are regularly invested in short term money market funds  government securities and commercial paper 
the company had committed an aggregate of million of this amount for a million installment paid in january  in connection with its acquisition of the infoworkspace business and million paid in january upon exercise of a put option for  shares of the company s common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in connection with the put option  the company may be required to purchase another million of its common stock in december the company had losses from operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital  increase revenue or substantially improve operating margins 
there appears little likelihood of securing additional capital on reasonable terms  if at all  in the near future 
in may  the company implemented a restructuring and cost reduction plan to reduce operating costs in line with anticipated revenues with the ultimate objective of improving operating margins and becoming cash flow neutral from operations 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded charges of approximately million of which all but approximately thousand had been paid by december  these charges  reported as restructuring expense  primarily represented severance costs related to the termination of employees  constituting approximately of the company s workforce at the time the cost reduction plan was implemented 
the reduction in workforce covered all functional areas  including research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  manufacturing and technical support 
operating costs at the end of december were in line with the company s expectations 
the company estimates its cash flow breakeven point to be approximately million to million in annual sales 
if the company is not successful in meeting its revenue targets  it may not be able to generate cash flows sufficient to continue operations 
the company s common stock is presently listed on the nasdaq national market nasdaq nms under the symbol ezen 
all companies listed on nasdaq are required to comply with certain continued listing standards  including maintaining a minimum bid price of at least 
as of february   the company did not meet this standard since its common stock had not traded at a minimum bid price of at least over the previous consecutive trading days 
pursuant to the rules of the nasdaq stock market  the company has until may  to meet the required minimum bid price for its common stock for at least consecutive trading days 
there can be no assurance that the company s common stock will meet the required minimum bid price at any time in the future or that any appeal by the company of any delisting determination would be successful 
in the event that the company s common stock is delisted from nasdaq nms  the market value and liquidity of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  the company has not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
the company invests cash in highly liquid investments  consisting of highly rated us and state government securities  commercial paper and short term money market funds
