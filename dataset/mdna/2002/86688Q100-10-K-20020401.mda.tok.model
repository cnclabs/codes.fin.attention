current assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
current liabilities  excluding debt obligations  were million and million  respectively  at december  and the company s consolidated working capital  excluding debt obligations  at december  was million and at december  was a deficit of million 
the increase in working capital is primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents resulting from the sales of properties and canwest investments and a reduction in current taxes payable 
included in current liabilities are income taxes that have been provided on gains on sales of assets computed on tax bases that result in higher gains for tax purposes than for accounting purposes 
strategies have been and may be implemented that may also defer and or reduce these taxes but the effects of these strategies have not been reflected in the accounts 
the company is an international holding company and its assets consist solely of investments in its subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
as a result  the company s ability to meet its future financial obligations is dependent upon the availability of cash flows from its united states and foreign subsidiaries through dividends  intercompany advances  management fees and other payments 
similarly  the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and its preferred stock may be limited as a result of its dependence upon the distribution of earnings of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
the company s subsidiaries and affiliated companies are under no obligation to pay dividends and  in the case of publishing and its principal united states and foreign subsidiaries  are subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions in debt agreements that limit their ability to pay dividends 
substantially  all of the shares of the subsidiaries of the company have been pledged to lenders of the company 
the company s right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary or affiliated company upon its liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such subsidiary or affiliated company  including trade creditors  except to the extent that the company may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against such subsidiary or affiliated company 
as at december   the company did not meet a financial test set out in the trust indentures for publishing s senior and senior subordinated notes 
as a result  until and unless the test is met in the future  publishing and its subsidiaries will be unable to borrow  make restricted investments  make advances  pay dividends or make other distributions to the company 
meeting the test will depend on improvements in future income 
the company currently has sufficient cash to meet its current anticipated obligations

full recovery of earnings levels would require a significant improvement in advertising activity and it is impossible to forecast when and to what extent  such a recovery will occur 
management believes that the cash flow provided by operating subsidiaries  under current economic conditions  will be sufficient to meet future cash requirements including capital expenditures 
however  there is no assurance that any excess cash flow could be distributed by publishing and its subsidiaries to the company 
however  as at march   the company has sufficient cash on hand to meet its current anticipated obligations

recent accounting pronouncements business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas business combinations and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually by comparing carrying value to the respective fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas as of july  and sfas is effective january  as of the date of adoption of sfas  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas amortization expense related to goodwill and intangibles was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting sfas on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether there will be any transitional impairment losses recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 

table of contents accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued in october the statement supersedes sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
it also provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
sfas is effective january  the company has not determined the impact of adopting sfas in the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk newsprint 
newsprint prices continued to fluctuate throughout and on a consolidated basis newsprint expense amounted to million million in and million in 
management believes that newsprint prices may vary widely from time to time and could continue to show significant price variations in the future 
during the first half of  newsprint prices in north america were at their highest price per tonne since and however  the recessional climate in caused a significant decline in industry consumption and this  coupled with an abundant supply of competitively priced newsprint resulted in a downward trend in prices during the second half of this downward trend has continued into the early part of and there are indications that prices will stabilize at their current levels 
in the united kingdom  newsprint prices payable by the company in  which are subject to longer term contracts  will be less than the average prices paid in operating divisions take steps to ensure that they have sufficient supply of newsprint and have mitigated cost increases by adjusting pagination and page sizes and printing and distributing practices 
for the company and subsidiaries  total newsprint usage in  for operations still owned at december   was about  tonnes 
at those levels of usage  a change in the price of newsprint of per tonne would increase or decrease net income by about million 
total return equity swap 
under the terms of the total return equity swap  a decline in the value of the company s share price could result in the company having to issue additional shares or pay a cash settlement of any loss suffered by the counterparties to the swap contracts 
a decrease in the company s share price of per share would result in an amount due to the counterparties of approximately million 
inflation 
during the past three years  inflation has not had a material effect on the company s newspaper business in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
interest rates 
at december   the company had no debt on which interest is calculated at floating rates 
interest paid to the banks under the total return equity swap is at floating rates 
a change in the interest rate would result in a change in interest cost  in respect of the total return equity swap of million per year 
foreign exchange rates 
a substantial portion of the company s income is earned outside of the united states in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as a result  the company s income is vulnerable to changes in the value of the united states dollar 
increases in the value of the united states dollar can reduce net earnings and declines can result in increased earnings 
based on earnings and ownership levels  a change in the important foreign currencies would have the following effect on the company s reported earnings actual average rate increase decrease united kingdom canada cdn 
 as a result of the sale of canadian properties in and  the company is significantly less vulnerable to changes in the value of the canadian dollar compared with the united states dollar

in respect of these debentures  the company will eventually be required to deliver to the participation trust million which equates to a fixed rate of exchange of united states dollars to each canadian dollar

the foreign currency contract requires the company to sell cdn 
million on may  at a forward rate of

electronic media 
management continues to hold the view that newspapers will continue to be an important business segment 
among educated and affluent people  indications are that strong newspaper readership will continue 
alternate forms of information delivery such as the internet could impact newspapers  but recognition of the internet s potential combined with a strong newspaper franchise could be a platform for internet operations 
newspaper readers can be offered a range of internet services as varied as the content 
virtually all newspapers are now published on the internet as well as in the traditional newsprint format
