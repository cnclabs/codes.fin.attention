item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
continuing operations we are a venture stage company 
our continuing operations consist of our software business  which began in mid in the third quarter of  we began development of a peer to peer file sharing and search network utilizing digital rights management technology  code named c star 
in december  we purchased certain assets of scour  inc for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we began beta testing of the new scour  which incorporates our c star technology  in march as a showcase music and video distribution network  which provides digital content free to the end user 
the new scour was the first application of c star representing a secure and legal digital distribution channel that integrates peer to peer technology with digital rights management support 
in july  we began marketing c star as a digital distribution service 
we signed our first customer for the service  jewishstreet 
com  in september we are currently working with jewishstreet 
com to integrate their websites with c star cdn services revenue from jewishstreet 
com and other potential c star customers is expected to begin in the second half of at december   c star remained a beta release as technological feasibility had not yet been met 
in february  we entered into an agreement with sony music  under which sony will make recordings available from its catalog of music performances for us to digitally distribute via c star cdn services to various c star service provider customers and their subscribers in the united states and canada 
in exchange  we issued sony  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  we agreed to pay an initial content integration fee of  in connection with execution of the agreement and an additional content integration fee of  on september   as well as quarterly advance minimum service fees of  for four quarters beginning september  the total value of the stock  warrants and cash was million 
we intend to use a combination of a direct sales group and marketing partnerships with market leaders and system integrators with respect to service and technology product licensing 
the sony agreement is the first step in our strategy to aggregate music and video content so that we may offer this content to potential c star service provider customers to increase the value of our software solution 
we intend to enter into similar arrangements with additional music labels and movie studios to obtain content 
we are pursuing two primary revenue opportunities utilizing the c star technology by providing the c star peer to peer digital distribution solution to third parties as a service  c star cdn service  in areas such as delivery of entertainment content music and video files  primarily charging fees on a transaction basis  and by selling c star cdn enterprise and other product solutions and related integration services due to our emphasis on c star technology solutions as a result of interest by potential customers  and the lack of currently available digital music and video content to launch a viable subscription service  we deferred the launch of a scour paid subscription service  which had been planned for the fourth quarter of at this time we are evaluating whether to launch a scour paid subscription service or to continue to use scour as a technology showcase and as a means to attract more hosts for c star 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
pursuant to december securities and exchange commission guidance  we have prepared the following discussion of critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
our critical accounting policies include the following accounting for intangible assets  revenue recognition  and purchased technology an explanation of the sensitivity of financial statements to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying their preparation and the interplay of specific uncertainties with accounting measurements follows intangible assets intangible assets primarily consist of a customer list and a trade name purchased during from scour  inc we review identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the assets  which is determined based on the discounted cash flow method or current market prices for similar assets when available 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
in january  intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is being superseded by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january  if we change the estimates used in the assessment of recoverability for intangible assets  such as our estimates of anticipated future revenues or of the life of the associated technologies  we may determine that our intangible assets have a lower net realizable value 
this  in turn  would increase our reported operating expenses  and lower our net income  but have no effect on our cash flows 
revenue recognition in compliance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
the earnings process is considered complete when persuasive evidences of an arrangement between the customer and us exists  when delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  when pricing is fixed or determinable  when any right of return lapses or is reasonably estimable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider differing market conditions such as the relative financial condition of our customer 
these conditions do not impact the method by which we recognize revenues  however such conditions could impact the allowance for returns or receivables 
research and development  purchased technology and software development costs we follow sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and charge all research and development costs to expense as incurred 
the costs of intangibles that are purchased from others for use in research and development activities and that have alternative future uses are capitalized 
those intangibles purchased for research that do not have an alternative future use in other research projects or otherwise are expensed as incurred 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
costs incurred for the development of computer software and enhancements to existing software products that will be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established 
to date  we have never capitalized any computer software development costs 
results of continuing operations year ended december  compared to revenues total revenues were  in compared to  in the revenue generated in relates to advertising placed on the scour 
com website by third parties 
the revenue generated in relates to socket  our internet communication product  which we are no longer marketing 
in september  we announced the first customer for c star 
revenue from this customer and other potential c star customers is expected to begin in the second half of due to our emphasis on c star  and the lack of available digital music and video content to launch a viable subscription service  we have deferred the launch of a paid subscription version of scour to at least the fourth quarter of potential customers interest in c star has caused us to focus on achieving revenue from the sale of c star cdn services and c star products under development 
we may continue to use scour as a showcase for c star and as a means of maintaining hosts for the c star network  and we may never launch a subscription version 
gross profit gross profit for was  of revenue  which was generated by advertising placed on the scour 
com website by third parties  compared to  of revenue in  which was generated by affiliate fees from e commerce partners relative to the socket product 
research and engineering research and engineering expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  consultant fees and the cost of purchased technology used in product development 
research and engineering expenses were million in compared to million in amounts incurred for research and engineering in primarily relate to the development and beta launch of the new scour in march and development of the c star technology 
the increase in compared to is primarily due to a million increase in salaries  contract labor and related costs for developing the c star technology  a million increase in depreciation and other infrastructure costs related to c star  the impairment of  of technology  which was purchased from scour  inc in december  and the purchase of  of technology from supertracks 
com  inc in august  which was expensed because the product into which the technology is being incorporated had not yet achieved technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
we determined that the  impairment charge was necessary because we are utilizing the c star technology that we developed internally rather than the technology purchased from scour 
the technology purchased from scour is not expected to produce future cash flows 
included in research and engineering expense in is a million charge related to the value of a warrant issued to intel in exchange for the ability to sublicense its launch connect technology 
this technology is no longer being utilized  nor are we attempting to sublicense the technology 
we anticipate incurring levels of research and engineering expense in similar to the level incurred in  except for the  impairment charge and the  purchase of technology  as we continue the development of our c star peer to peer digital distribution solution 
we had employees in research and engineering functions at december   compared to at december  the increased head count resulted from increased research and engineering activities in and the data center operations group of people supporting research and engineering activities 
the data center operations group previously supported selling  general  and administrative activities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in direct sales  partner development  consultant fees  advertising  promotional materials  executive  legal  accounting and administrative personnel  professional services and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in sales and marketing expenditures in primarily focused on developing customers and markets for the new scour and our c star cdn services 
the increase in is primarily due to million for the impairment of certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  million of amortization expense in related to the purchase of certain intangible assets of scour  inc in the fourth quarter of  million related to the establishment of our digital media and entertainment group  which is responsible for building long term business relationships with content providers   related to additional infrastructure costs for c star   related to value of non employee stock options issued in exchange for services   in increased salaries and related expenses and public relations expense  and a  increase in legal and related expenses for defending against legal claims and obtaining and protecting patents and trademarks 
we anticipate incurring levels of general and administrative expenses in that are similar to those incurred in we anticipate increased sales expense  not including the million charge related to the impairment of certain intangible assets  as we promote and sell c star digital distribution solutions 
at december   we had employees in selling  general and administrative functions compared to at december  the decreased head count resulted from the data center operations group now supporting research and engineering activities  offset in part by the addition of various positions in the selling  general and administrative functions 
the data center operations group previously supported selling  general  and administrative activities 
interest income interest income decreased to  in from  in as a result of lower interest rates in compared to and higher cash balances in the first half of the higher cash balances in the first half of resulted primarily from the sale of debt and equity securities in private placements during and the sale of our hardware business in october for million 
our cash balances increased during the first half of as a result of the sales of common stock to an individual investor for proceeds of million late in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of  and the sale of  units to nine investors for total proceeds of million in the second quarter of  which will result in interest income until utilized 
provision for income taxes a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of deferred tax assets generated in and due to the uncertainty regarding the utilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards

we anticipated to be an investment year  in which the focus was on the distribution of socket to end users and did not expect to generate significant revenue 
the adoption rate of socket was less than expected  primarily  we believe  due to a lack of open standards for communications between instant messaging products 
we believe that the future of internet community  collaboration and communications will be driven by open  standards based technology and solutions 
the  of revenue generated in was from the retail sale of talk n play and iconference software products 
we discontinued marketing and selling talk n play and iconference during when it was determined that such products would not generate sufficient revenue to support our business 
gross profit gross profit for was  of revenue  and was generated from affiliate fees from e commerce partners relative to the socket product

we made significant investments in research and engineering in related to our internet community  collaboration and communications software business 
we significantly increased the size of our engineering department during and  at december   we had in the engineering group compared to at december  the increase in compared to is due to a million increase in salaries  recruiting and related costs associated with the development of socket and c star and a  increase in depreciation

the increases in the selling and marketing activities in were undertaken with the assumption that we would generate revenue from our socket product to support such expenditures 
when revenues did not materialize as anticipated  we reduced  and  by the end of  virtually eliminated  spending related to socket 
in the fourth quarter of  we began focusing our selling and marketing activities on the new scour 
interest income interest income increased to  in from  in as a result of increased cash balances  which resulted primarily from private placements of debt and equity securities during and the sale of our hardware business in october for million

results of discontinued operations sale of the hardware business our hardware business historically comprised the bulk of our revenues and expenses 
from our founding in through  we were a leader in designing and marketing innovative pc game controller products under the name of thrustmaster 
however  commencing in  many larger competitors  including microsoft corporation  kensington gravis  logitech international sa  and interact accessories  which had greater economies of scale  financial  technical and marketing resources than us  entered the game controller market  creating an extremely competitive environment characterized by declining prices and increased marketing costs 
our management determined that we could not achieve the economies of scale necessary to be profitable in the game controller market and concluded that we should sell the hardware business and invest the proceeds in our internet community  collaboration and communication business 
in october  guillemot corporation sa guillemot purchased certain of our assets for a total price of million  of which million was retained in escrow and was to be released to us pursuant to an escrow agreement 
in june  we filed a lawsuit for breach of contract against guillemot alleging that guillemot breached the terms of the escrow agreement by prohibiting the scheduled release of escrow funds to us 
in march  we entered in into a settlement agreement and mutual release with guillemot  under which we received approximately million of restricted cash from escrow 
guillemot received approximately million from escrow  consisting of approximately  collected on their behalf and downward purchase price adjustments of approximately  no amounts remained in escrow at december  the purchase price adjustments made pursuant to the asset purchase agreement mainly related to uncollected accounts receivable 
in connection with the release of the restricted cash and final settlement with guillemot  we recognized a gain on disposal of discontinued operations in of  the sale of the hardware business has been accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  its operations are segregated in the statements of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenues from discontinued operations were million for the year ended december  certain expenses have been allocated to continuing operations  based on the number of employees remaining with the software business  their related employee costs and overhead for facilities and other related costs and corporate overhead expenses that were expected to represent continuing expenses 
loss from discontinued operations was million in the loss from discontinued operations represents the net activity of the discontinued hardware business  including revenues and associated expenses and the resulting tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of to included in working capital is  of restricted cash related to deposits for certain contracts  a majority of which is scheduled to be paid in may we have financed our activities since the disposition of our hardware business in october primarily with a combination of proceeds from the sale of our hardware business and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
in march  we entered into an agreement with peter kellogg  who unconditionally agreed to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  if requested to do so by us  in one or more private transactions representing total maximum proceeds to us of million 
as compensation for entering into this commitment  we issued to mr 
kellogg a three year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
to the extent that mr 
kellogg purchases more than  shares of our common stock under this commitment  he will also receive a three year warrant to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock at per share 
we also arranged a stand by line of credit in the amount of million on which we can draw after july in march  we sold  units to a total of six accredited investors for per unit for total proceeds to us of million 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock for per share 
in february  we sold  units to a total of twelve accredited investors for per unit for total proceeds to us of million 
each unit consists of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock for per share 
in june  we sold  units  each consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  to nine accredited investors for per unit the day trailing volume weighted average price of our common stock for total proceeds to us of million 
in conjunction with this issuance  warrants covering an additional  shares of our common stock were issued to certain finders at an exercise price of per share 
in march  we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with guillemot  under which we received approximately million of restricted cash from escrow 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  we sold  shares of our common stock to an accredited investor for per share for total proceeds to us of million 
in conjunction with this issuance we issued warrants exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to five designees of the investor s financial consultant 
the warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of per share and expire in december cash decreased million in primarily as a result of million used in operations   for the purchase of equipment and  for payments on a capital lease  offset by total proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities 
accrued liabilities decreased million to  at december   from million at december  primarily due to our final settlement with guillemot in connection with the release of restricted cash from escrow 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a one year capital lease obligation for  for the purchase of certain information systems software for our c star platform 
as of december   we owed  on this obligation 
we spent million on capital expenditures in  including the  financed with a capital lease  primarily for engineering and information systems equipment and software 
we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures during primarily for additional server hardware and software and engineering development tools 
in connection with our agreement with sony in february  which is described above  we agreed to pay an initial content integration fee of  in connection with execution of the agreement and an additional content integration fee of  on september   as well as quarterly advance minimum service fees of  for four quarters beginning september  based on current estimates  we anticipate utilizing to million of cash on a quarterly basis to fund our operations during cash expenditures during will primarily be for continued selling and marketing and research and engineering expenses related to c star digital distribution solutions 
in addition  we will continue to incur expenses  although at lower levels than during  related to scour  as we further develop scour as a showcase for c star and as a part of our content hosting network 
we may also incur costs to convert scour to a subscription service during given current cash requirement estimates and cash and cash equivalents available at december  plus million of proceeds received from private placements of our equity securities in february and march and commitments for up to an additional million  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations at projected levels for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
additionally  there can be no assurance that current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing and any financing we obtain may dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders prior to the financing 
in addition  we may  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities

is an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas nos 
and establish accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas nos 
and are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not currently have any derivative instruments and  accordingly  the adoption of sfas nos 
 and in the first quarter of did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is being superseded by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
july  and the provisions of sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
requires  upon adoption of sfas no 
 that we evaluate our existing intangible assets that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition of separately identifiable intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first quarter of in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we are required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first quarter of any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
at december   we did not have any goodwill  but had unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million 
we anticipate that we will continue to amortize all of our identifiable intangible assets 
amortization expense related to identifiable intangibles was million in and in both and in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to our intangible assets 
we do not anticipate recording an additional impairment charge in the first quarter of upon adoption of sfas no 
in august  the fasb approved sfas no

sfas no 
retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
 but resolves certain implementation issues 
sfas no 
was also adopted january  although we have not completed the evaluation of the affects of the adoption of sfas nos 
and  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas nos 
and will have a material affect on our financial condition or results of operations 
factors that may affect forward looking statements if our solutions are not adopted by potential customers  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we began our software business in mid accordingly  we have a limited operating history with which you can evaluate our current business and prospects 
our business is new and will not be successful unless potential customers adopt wide usage of our products and services and revenues are generated from our services and product offerings 
we derived insignificant revenues from the socket product and are no longer developing or promoting it 
we have not launched a scour subscription service and may continue to operate scour as a free beta service to showcase c star 
we have only signed one customer for c star cdn services to date 
in addition  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the internet digital distribution markets 
we incurred substantial losses from continuing operations in our software business in  and and continued losses may deplete our capital resources 
we have derived insignificant revenues from our software business and have incurred substantial losses from continuing operations of million in  million in and million in  and in every quarter since we began our software operations 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we will achieve profitability 
in addition  we plan to increase our operating expenses to market  sell and implement our peer to peer digital distribution solution through increased staffing and organizational expenses  marketing costs  capital expenditures and other expenses 
as a result  we expect to incur significant operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
continued losses would impair our capital resources  which in turn may require that we raise additional capital or curtail our business activities 
we may need to raise additional funds to finance ongoing operations  which may require us to commit significant amounts of capital to debt service and could result in dilution to our shareholders 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and committed funds will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
additionally  there can be no assurance that current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing and any financing we obtain may dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders prior to the financing 
in addition  we may  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which could impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
if we are not successful in selling our c star digital distribution solutions to several large customers  we may not be able to generate significant revenue  which could lead to continued operating losses 
our revenue expectations include significant transaction based service provider and product sales revenues to be received from customers of c star digital distribution solutions 
if we are not successful in selling c star digital distribution solutions to several large customers in the form of a service or product  we may not be able to generate significant revenue  which could lead to continued operating losses 
if we fail to secure access to additional popular music and video files  we may not be able to generate significant revenue from selling c star digital distribution services  which could lead to continued operating losses 
our revenue model for is based in large part on digital distribution service fees from c star 
in february  we entered into a digital music distribution agreement with sony music  which allows us to digitally distribute their catalog 
if we fail to secure access to additional popular music and video files from more than one major music label or movie studio  we may not be able to generate significant c star cdn services revenue from customers wishing to offer a consumer entertainment service 
if we fail to attract a significant number of subscribers to scour  we may not achieve anticipated revenues  which could lead to continued operating losses 
part of our strategy in building out the c star network is to attract consumers to actively use the scour showcase service and act as hosts for digital files 
the larger the network of digital hosts  the stronger the value of the c star cdn services network 
if we fail to attract a significant number of subscribers to scour  we may not be able to achieve anticipated c star cdn services revenue 
if consumers are able to get music and video files for free  we may not be able to achieve anticipated revenue  which could lead to continued operating losses 
in march  the largest internet file sharing network  napster  was ordered by a federal court to block the exchange of copyrighted music identified by the music labels 
our revenue expectations include significant c star cdn services revenue from customers operating subscription based entertainment services 
third party surveys of napster and other free peer to peer exchange users indicate a willingness to pay for digital music files on a subscription basis by a majority of users if the files are not available for free 
the record industry and the motion picture industry continue to attack several forms of illegal exchange of copyrighted files 
if innovative software providers are able to develop alternative technologies for free file sharing  it may be difficult for our customers to attract and retain paying subscribers to subscription entertainment services 
if we are unable to successfully develop new c star products and new capabilities for c star cdn services  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues  which could lead to continued operating losses 
we believe that the c star search and peer to peer file distribution technology  which is the basis of c star cdn services and scour  can be applied in vertical markets outside of media and entertainment 
for some vertical markets  such as the enterprise market  a product offering must be developed 
for others  we are pursuing a service provider  transaction based licensing strategy to generate revenue from the use of the c star digital distribution channel 
if we are unable to develop new products and service capabilities for c star cdn services  we may not achieve anticipated revenues or profitability 
if we are not able to compete effectively  we may not be able to generate anticipated subscription  service and product sale revenues  which could lead to continued operating losses 
the internet digital distribution business is competitive 
many of our competitors may have greater resources and experience us 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
our principal competitors include content distribution network cdn service and product vendors  such as akamai  digital island  inktomi and kontiki  internet music distributors that use digital download  peer to peer or streaming technologies  such as mpcom  napster  liquid audio  press play and real networks  music labels and movie studios  as well as providers of digital entertainment services such as musicnet  listen 
com and rioport 
many of our current and future competitors may have advantages over us  including longer operating histories  larger customer bases  substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  greater name recognition  and the ability to more easily provide a comprehensive software solution 
our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that would increase their ability to compete with us 
in addition  competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs  or to devote more resources to promoting and selling their products 
if we fail to adapt to market demands and to compete successfully with existing and new competitors  our ability to generate service and product revenues will suffer 
if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to timely deploy products and services based on c star  which may delay or decrease anticipated revenues and lead to continued operating losses 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and development personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers  engineering personnel  or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely deploy products and services based on c star  which may delay or decrease anticipated revenues and profitability 
our employees are employed on an at will basis and could terminate their employment with us at any time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we are not able to attract and retain additional personnel  we may not be able to timely market  sell and deploy products and services based on c star  which may delay or decrease anticipated revenues and lead to continued operating losses 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to market  sell and deploy products and services based on c star 
we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely deploy services and products  which may delay or decrease anticipated revenues and profitability 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may be unable to attract  assimilate  or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
we attempt to hire engineers with high levels of experience in marketing  selling  designing and developing software in time pressured environments 
there are a limited number of qualified personnel in our geographic location  resulting in intense competition for their services 
we may not be able to establish partnerships to sell products and services based on c star in new vertical markets  which may delay or decrease revenues 
we do not currently have adequate marketing and sales personnel to sell products and services based on c star in vertical markets outside of media and entertainment 
rather than hire significant additional personnel  we are employing a business development strategy of partnering with market leaders in product sales and system integrators to sell into specific vertical markets  such as enterprise communications and storage  elearning and digital media distribution for medical applications 
we may not be able to establish partnerships with market leaders in product sales or system integrators in some or any vertical markets  which may delay or decrease expected revenues 
we may not be able to make desired acquisitions or integrate acquired assets into our operations  which could result in limited stock price appreciation or shareholder dilution 
a component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not be successful in completing and integrating any future acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to complete acquisitions on terms acceptable to us 
we have limited experience with completing and integrating acquisitions as a team 
our failure to effectively integrate any acquired businesses could adversely affect us 
in connection with any acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities  which may increase our leverage and cash required to service debt  and incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with strategic partners and customers  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
if we are unable to increase the size of our systems and management resources related to our operations  we may not achieve anticipated c star or scour revenues  which could lead to continued operating losses 
we are currently beta testing the c star infrastructure  utilizing computer infrastructure that we expect to be capable of supporting several hundred thousand registered users 
to support a combined c star cdn services and scour service that could have more than a million subscribers  we intend to hire additional management resources with experience in this area and increase the size and capacity of our computer infrastructure 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring additional management resources with experience in this area  or if we are unable to successfully increase the capacity of our computer systems  we may be unable to support enough subscribers to achieve anticipated revenues or profitability 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  competitors could obtain access to proprietary information  which could have a material adverse impact on our service and product sales revenues 
we regard elements of c star as proprietary and are attempting to protect them by relying on patent  trademark  service mark  trade dress  copyright  and trade secret laws and restrictions  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
protecting our intellectual property may be time consuming and expensive 
in addition  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
any infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our subscription and licensing revenues 
new patent applications may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties 
effective trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are used 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technology that substantially limits the value of our intellectual property 
others may bring intellectual property infringement claims against us  which could require significant resources to defend and could lead to restrictions on our current operations 
in addition to the technology we have developed internally  we have acquired or licensed technologies from other companies including intel  microsoft  oracle and cognos 
our internally developed technology  or the technology we acquired or licensed  may infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights and third parties may bring claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
any infringement or claim of infringement could have a material adverse effect on our business  resulting in suspension of revenue generating activities or the payment of cash 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation 
however  we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
these potential claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
any litigation involving intellectual property  regardless of its success  likely would be time consuming and expensive to defend and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating  or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and redesign those products or services that incorporate the technology at issue 
software defects could inhibit our ability to attract customers or cause losses of customers  which would adversely affect our revenues 
our software may contain undetected errors  or bugs  when first introduced or as new versions or enhancements are released 
despite our internal testing  these errors may be discovered only after our software has been installed and used by customers 
these undetected errors may relate to components supplied to us 
our services and products under development are complex as a result of factors including advanced functionality  the diverse operating environments in which the products may be deployed  and the multiple versions of our products that will need to be supported for diverse operating platforms and standards 
the complexity of our services and products under development increases the likelihood that they may contain errors when introduced 
problems encountered by customers or software recalls could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain potential customers of c star cdn services and related products 
the market price for our common stock  like other technology stocks  may be volatile  and a decrease could adversely affect us 
the market price of centerspan s common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  and our failure to meet investors and analysts performance expectations 
in addition  the stock markets have recently experienced price and volume volatility that has affected stock prices for many companies in the technology sector 
general stock market trends may continue to be negative for this sector and this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock even though our business prospects may be good 
if the market price of our common stock decreases  it may become more difficult for us to raise needed additional capital through the sale of equity securities and may result in increased dilution to our existing shareholders 
we may experience an adverse impact from future sales of our stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders or holders of options or warrants could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
as of march    shares of our common stock were subject to outstanding stock options under our stock option plans at a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
as of march    shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   substantially all of our liquid investments were at fixed interest rates and had original maturities of days or less 
as a result  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal
