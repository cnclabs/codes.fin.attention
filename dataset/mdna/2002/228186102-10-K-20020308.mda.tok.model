the note references in this item can be found on pages to historical results set forth in the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of crown american realty trust the company are not necessarily indicative of future financial position and results of operations of the company 
a general background and performance measurement organization crown american realty trust the company was formed in to acquire interests in enclosed shopping malls and certain other real estate collectively the properties then owned by crown american corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of crown holding company crown holding 
the company is a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
on august  the company completed its initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million in equity from issuing approximately million shares  including the subsequent exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the company used the proceeds to purchase an initial general partnership interest in crown american properties  lp the operating partnership  a partnership which was formed just prior to consummation of the offering referred to above 
the current minority limited common partnership interests are held by crown investments trust and by crown american investment company  a wholly owned subsidiary of crown investments trust  both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of crown holding 
the funds raised in the initial public offering were used by the operating partnership to retire debt related to the properties 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company also holds of the preferred partnership interests in the operating partnership that arose in connection with the company s issuance of preferred shares in july simultaneous with the initial public offering  crown american associates  successor to crown american corporation  and an affiliate transferred the properties and the management operations into either the company  the operating partnership  or crown american financing partnership the financing partnership  a partnership owned by the operating partnership and by the company 
as a result of these transactions  the company is engaged primarily in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  expansion  development and financing of shopping malls 
in addition  simultaneous with the above transaction  the financing partnership borrowed million of mortgage debt initially secured by properties 
the million was used to retire existing debt related to the properties

the properties held by the company at december  consist of i wholly owned enclosed shopping malls together with adjoining outparcels and approximately acres of undeveloped land located in pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland  tennessee  north carolina  west virginia  virginia and georgia  ii a general partnership interest in palmer park mall venture  which owns palmer park mall located in easton  pennsylvania  iii pasquerilla plaza  an office building in johnstown  pennsylvania  which serves as the headquarters of the company and is partially leased to other parties  and iv a parcel of land under ground lease with purchase option improved with a building leased to a department store chain 
b funds from operations year ended december  versus year ended december  the total ffo for before allocations to minority interest and to preferred shareholders was million compared to million in  a increase 
ffo allocable to common shares increased from million in to million in  an improvement of million 
average common shares outstanding during both and were approximately  the number of properties were the same for both years  except for greater lewistown shopping plaza  a non enclosed shopping center  which was sold in june the increase in ffo of million before allocations to minority interest and to preferred dividends versus was due primarily to the following i a net million increase in mall shop and anchor base and percentage rents  consisting of a million increase in mall shop base rents due to a slightly higher occupancy and higher average rents  a million decrease in anchor base rents  and a million decrease in mall shop and anchor percentage rents due to lower sales volume  ii million in higher lease buyout income due to lease termination fees received from numerous tenants  iii million in higher straight line rents  iv million in lower interest expense  primarily as a result of lower libor rates on floating rate debt  v million in higher temporary and seasonal leasing income  vi million in higher cash flow support payments  and vii million in higher net construction income and miscellaneous mall income 
these positive varia nces were partially offset by viii million in higher property operating costs  net of tenant reimbursements comprised of million in higher property operating costs including million of accrued environmental remediation costs  and a slightly lower rate of cost recovery from tenants  ix million in lower gain on the sale of outparcel land  x million in lower fees on the sale of non reit assets  and xi million in higher general and administrative expenses  offset by million in restructuring costs that occurred in year ended december  versus year ended december  total year ffo before allocations to minority interest and to preferred shareholders was million compared to million in  a increase 
s ffo has been restated  as required under nareit s national association of real estate investment trusts revised definition of ffo  to reflect the impact of one time restructuring costs 
this restatement impacted s ffo by million 
ffo allocable to common shares for the year ended december  was million  a increase over million reported in average common shares outstanding during both and were  the number of properties were the same for both years  except for the greater lewistown shopping plaza  a non enclosed strip shopping center  which was sold in june the increase in ffo before allocations to minority interest and to preferred dividends compared to was due primarily to the following i a million increase in mall shop and anchor base and percentage rents  as a result of higher occupancy levels  higher average rental rates  and higher mall shop sales  ii million in higher temporary and seasonal leasing income  iii million in higher net utility and miscellaneous mall income  iv million in higher gain on the sale of outparcel land  v million in higher net construction and fee income  vi million in higher lease buyout income  and vii lower restructuring costs  net of other g a increases  of million 
these positive variances were partially offset by viii million in higher interest costs due to higher interest rates  higher deferred financing cost amortization  lower interest capitalized  and higher average borrowings outstanding  ix million in higher property operat ing costs  net of recoveries  and x million in lower straight line rental income 
c ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the computation of ebitda is shown below for the years ended december    and year ended december  net income minority interest in operating partnership income before minority interest gain loss on sale of depreciable assets interest depreciation and amortization restructuring costs extraordinary items operating covenant amortization included as a reduction of minimum rent depreciation in g a  in recoverable costs interest on joint venture depreciation on joint venture total ebitda  as reported year ended december  versus year ended december  total ebitda for the year ended december  was million  a slight decrease from s reported ebitda of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of higher property operating costs  net of recoveries  and lower gain on outparcel sales  offset by higher mall shop base rents  higher lease buyout income  higher temporary and seasonal rents  and higher straight line rents 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total ebitda for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over s ebitda of million 
this increase was primarily due to higher rents and higher occupancy in the existing portfolio  partially offset by higher property operating costs 
d property operating results and trends aggregate tenant sales volume over the long term  the level of anchor and mall shop tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the company as anchor and mall shop tenants provide over of total revenues and because tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of tenant sales are considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
total reported sales for all tenants that reported sales for the applicable years are shown below in millions anchors owned locations mall shop tenants  excluding freestanding  theater  and supermarkets the above data excludes sales from all seasonal and temporary tenants who generally do not report their sales to the company 
the company owned of anchor store locations at december  in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of declining sales  rents on new leases tend to grow more slowly 
however  revenues generally increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average base rents per square foot for mall shop tenants at quarter end for the last three years are shown in the following table 
the increase in average base rent during these three years results primarily from renewing existing leases at higher base rents  from leasing vacant space at higher base rents  and from elimination of lower paying tenants that closed during these periods 
march june september december comparable mall store sales and occupancy cost management believes that over long periods of time the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
occupancy costs are comprised of base fixed rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and other costs pertaining to the property 
because most mall shop tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable is a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
while such increased occupancy costs as a percentage of sales cannot grow indefinitely for any one tenant  management believes that it is possible to increase the percentage paid by all tenants as a group by aggressively working to replace under performing tenants with better performing ones 
comparable mall store sales per square foot in each reporting period is based on sales reported by mall store tenants excludes anchors and certain other large space users that occupied space in both the current and immediately preceding reporting period 
comparable mall store sales per square foot for the last three years are set out below 
also shown below is the percentage of mall shop tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of their annual sales 
comparable mall store sales per square foot occupancy cost percentage at period end seasonality and occupancy the enclosed shopping mall industry is seasonal in nature  with anchor and mall shop tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and expense recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  many leases are scheduled to expire in the first calendar quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
the aggregate mall shop occupancy percentage  defined as the ratio of total mall shop space that is leased including both tenants occupying space and tenants that have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy to the total mall shop space gross leasable area gla at quarter end for the last three years is set out below

e results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues components of minimum rents and percentage rents for the years ended december    and are as follows year ended december  components of minimum rents anchors base rents mall shops freestanding base rents mall shops freestanding percentage rent in lieu of fixed base rent straight line rental income ground leases base rents lease buyout income operating covenant amortization total minimum rents components of percentage overage rents anchors mall shops  freestanding  and ground leases total percentage overage rents total revenues in were million  an increase of million  or  over s revenues of million 
revenues in prior years have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation 
this reclassification is the result of reflecting utility redistribution income on a gross basis 
revenues were increased by million  million  and million in   and  respectively  due to this classification 
the primary reasons for the revenue growth of million in were higher base rents from mall shops  higher temporary and seasonal leasing  higher lease termination fees  and higher straight line rents 
these positive impacts on revenues were partially offset by lower percentage rents  lower base rents from anchor tenants  and lower construction income 
property operating costs property operating and administrative costs  including utility redistribution costs  but excluding depreciation and amortization  increased from million in to million in  or 
the year contained million of expense related to construction costs incurred for an anchor tenant 
most of the increased expense in was attributable to higher operating costs  including higher environmental expense  higher maintenance costs  and higher security expense 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in  primarily as a result of higher amortization of tenant improvement costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses  net of capitalized amounts  increased by million in compared to gross spending was less than in due to the continuation of the company s cost containment efforts 
this reduction in gross spending  however  was offset by lower capitalization of construction department costs due to a lower volume of construction expenditures 
interest expense  net interest expense net of capitalized amounts and interest income for was million  a decrease of million compared to most of this decrease was attributable to i numerous decreases throughout in libor rates  impacting interest expense on all variable rated debt  and ii lower amortization of deferred financing costs 
gain on sale of outparcel land the gain on sale of outparcel land was million in compared to million in this decrease was directly the result of fewer outparcel sales in year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over s revenues of million 
revenues increased in primarily due to higher base and percentage rents due to higher occupancy  higher average rents  and higher mall shop sales 
in addition  year revenues include million in construction income related to an anchor tenant 
property operating and administrative costs  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million in  an increase over of this increase  million related to construction expense incurred for an anchor tenant 
most of the remaining increase was attributable to higher operating costs at the properties  including maintenance costs  insurance  security  food court  and property administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in  primarily due to a full year s depreciation and amortization expense on the valley mall and washington crown center redevelopments which were substantially completed in late general and administrative expenses  net of capitalized amounts  increased by million in compared to gross spending was million lower in due to savings from the and restructurings 
this reduction was largely offset by lower capitalization of construction overhead because most construction projects were completed 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to severance and related costs for employees affected by an reduction in the corporate office staff together with reductions in other corporate expenses 
the restructuring involved approximately twelve home office employees  representing a cross section of management and clerical employees 
during the first and third quarters of  the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  related to severance and related costs for employees affected by two reductions in the number of corporate office staff together with reductions in other corporate office related expenses 
the restructurings involved approximately thirty five home office employees  representing a cross section of management  clerical  and secretarial employees 
the restructuring costs are shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
approximately 
million was paid out during related to the three restructuring programs outlined above 
approximately million of liability remains at december  and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
it is expected that the majority of this liability will be paid in interest expense net of capitalized amounts and interest income for was million  a million increase over this increase was due to a variety of factors  including higher average borrowings outstanding million  higher interest rates million  higher financing cost amortization million  and lower interest capitalization and lower interest income million 
gain on sale of outparcel land was million in  million higher than statement on accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectable accounts and for losses under the company s self insurance program  and the treatment of certain costs as capital or expense 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the company is required to adopt sfas effective january  the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a mat erial effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas whose provisions discuss the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
the implementation of sfas which is effective january   is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas  but resolves certain implementation issues associated with that statement 
the company has early adopted the provisions of sfas during the third quarter of fiscal and its implementation did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
accounting for minority interest minority interest represents the common partnership units in the operating partnership that are owned by crown investments and its subsidiary 
at december  crown investments and its subsidiary owned  common partnership units  or of the total common partnership units outstanding 
crown american realty trust owns the remaining 
the minority interest balance is adjusted each year for crown investments and its subsidiary s proportionate share of net income loss of the operating partnership after deducting preferred unit distributions  common partnership distributions  and additional capital contributions 
primarily because the common partnership distributions have been larger than the operating partnership s income loss after preferred unit distributions  the minority interest account on the consolidated balance sheets has been declining each year 
the balance was reduced below zero in the second quarter of under generally accepted accounting principles  when the minority partner s share of the operating partnership s net income loss and the minority partner s cash distributions and capital contributions  would cause the minority interest balance to be less than zero  such balance must be reported at zero unless there is a legal obligation of the minority partner to reimburse the operating partnership for such excess amounts 
the cash flow support agreement does provide for such obligation by the minority partner in the form of cash flow support payments on four now three of the company s malls that were in the lease up phase at the time of the company s ipo in accordingly  since the minority interest account is reduced below zero  and there is a legal obligation of the minority partner to make additional cash contributions to the operating partnership  the minority interest balance at december  is shown on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset 
this asset balance at december  has been limited to million  the estimated amount of cash flow support to be received over the next twelve months 
an additional amount of million  representing the excess losses and distributions over and above the cash flow support  has been absorbed by the company in its share of loss from the operating partnership for the calendar year ended december  on a cumulative basis  million of such losses have been absorbed by the company  through and including december  f cash flows  liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december    and  the company generated million  million  and million  respectively  in cash from operating activities  as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows in item hereto 
cash flows during  the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities  which includes a positive impact of million from changes in receivables  restricted cash and escrow deposits  deferred charges and other assets  and accounts payable and other liabilities 
the company invested million in its existing properties in which included million in tenant allowances  million in the expansion of phillipsburg mall to accommodate an h m store  and million in various other operational capital expenditures 
the company used million in its financing activities  which included i additional borrowings of million  net of escrow deposits and issuance costs  ii million of loan amortization and debt repayments  iii million of common and preferred dividends  and iv million of cash flow support see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows during  the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities  which is net of an aggregate million negative impact from changes in receivables  restricted cash and escrow deposits  deferred charges and other assets  and accounts payable and other liabilities 
the company invested million in its existing properties in which included million in the valley mall redevelopment project  million in the expansion renovation of washington crown center  and million in mall shop tenant allowances 
the company received million in net proceeds from the sale of the greater lewistown shopping plaza and from the sale of an anchor store to its owner occupant 
the company used a net million in its financing activities  which included i additional borrowings of million  net of debt issuance costs  ii million of loan amortization and debt repayments  iii million of common and preferred dividends  iv million of cash flow support see note to the consolidated financial statements  and v million of preferred stock buybacks 
cash flows during  the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities  which is net of an aggregate million negative impact from changes in receivables  restricted cash and escrow deposits  deferred charges and other assets  and accounts payable and other liabilities 
the company invested million in its existing properties in which included million in the valley mall redevelopment project  million in the expansion renovation of washington crown center  and million in mall shop tenant allowances 
the company received million in cash from a note receivable in connection with the sale of middletown mall in the company used a net million in its financing activities  which included i additional borrowings of million under its modified line of credit facility much of which was used for the valley mall expansion project see note to the consolidated financial statements  ii million in borrowings under its construction loan for washington crown center  iii million in debt amortization and debt issuance costs  iv million paid in common and preferred dividends  and v million received in cash flow support 
liquidity and capital resources the company has significant ongoing capital requirements 
the company believes that its cash generated from property operations and funds obtained from its lines of credit  property financings and general corporate borrowings will provide the necessary funds on a short term and long term basis for its operating expenses  debt service on outstanding indebtedness and recurring capital expenditures and tenant allowances  and dividends to the shareholders at a level necessary to satisfy the reit dividend distribution requirements under the internal revenue code see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of dividends required to be paid in order to maintain reit status for was million 
this is significantly less than the total million in dividends paid on preferred and common shares in the company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors  in cluding cash flow from operations  capital expenditures  and its ability to refinance its maturing debt as described below 
dividends by the company will be at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the trustees may consider 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the borrowing capacity under the company s line of credit with ge capital corporation is increased or decreased based on the level of underwritten net operating income  as defined  for the six malls that are mortgaged to secure the line of credit 
underwritten net operating income is calculated quarterly  and the borrowing capacity adjusted up or down accordingly 
underwritten net operating income can increase or increase depending on the performance of the six malls  and is also reduced for any anchor tenant that declares bankruptcy  even if the tenant continues to operate its store and pay rent 
at december  the borrowing capacity was approximately million and will be reduced in the first quarter of by about million due to the bankruptcy filing of kmart in january there is one kmart anchor store in the six malls 
management does not believe this kmart store will be closed due to the relatively strong level of sales generated by this store 
as also described in note  twenty malls are owned by or ground leased to special purpose consolidated subsidiaries  as required under various loan agreements 
the mortgaged malls and related assets owned or ground leased by these special purpose consolidated subsidiaries are restricted under the loan agreements for the debt service and others payments under the related mortgage loans and are not available to pay other debts of the consolidated company 
however  so long as the loans are not under an event of default  as defined in the loan agreements  the cash flows from these properties  after debt service and reserve payments are made  are available for the general use of the company 
several of the company s loans and its lines of credit contain financial covenants  the failure to observe such covenants would constitute events of default under the loans and if not cured by the company would give the lenders additional rights  including to receive all cash flows from the properties or to require the loan s to be repaid immediately 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of and during the year ended december  and through the date hereof except for requirements under the gecc mortgage loan  the gecc line of credit and the loan on capital city mall that closed on january  to have insurance policies in place with insurance companies that have certain minimum credit ratings  as defined in the agreement 
two of the major insurance companies used by the company had been down graded below required levels by certain rating agencies  subsequent to year end  the lenders approved the continued use of these insurance companies  provided no furth er rating downgrades occur 
if such downgrades were to occur and not be waived by the lenders  the company will be required to replace its coverage with other insurance companies that satisfy the loan credit requirements 
while management believes that it will be able to do so  if required  there is no assurance it can do so  because future conditions may prevent the company from securing such insurance 
in addition  the premiums paid may increase significantly from those paid under current insurance policies 
sources of capital for non recurring capital expenditures  such as major building renovations and expansions  acquisitions  and for balloon payments on maturing outstanding indebtedness  are expected to be obtained from additional company or property financings and refinancings  sale of non strategic assets  additional equity raised in the public or private markets  and from retained internally generated cash flows  or from combinations thereof 
given the company s current level of indebtedness  and given the uncertainties concerning future equity and debt capital markets and interest rates  there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure such future infusions of equity and or debt financing and refinancings when needed  or at rates or terms that will permit the company to use the proceeds raised to increase earnings or funds from operations 
there are no major expansions ore renovations planned to occur in in october  the company executed a three year extension to july of a million mortgage loan that was scheduled to mature in mid the interest rate on the mortgage loan will change in july from a fixed rate of to a floating rate of libor plus  annual debt service will be reduced from current levels at this time as well 
on january  the company closed a million loan with a lender secured by its capital city mall in harrisburg  pa with only limited recourse to the company 
the loan bears interest at a stated annual fixed rate of approximately  and is interest only during the first two years  and then amortizes during the last eight years based on a year amortization schedule 
of the total proceeds from the new loan  million was used to prepay an existing mortgage loan on capital city mall  which included a million yield maintenance prepayment penalty 
this prepayment penalty  together with million of unamortized deferred financing costs  will be recorded as an extraordinary loss non ffo in january the remaining proceeds were used for loan closing costs and various loan reserves aggregating million  with the balance of million of net proceeds available for general corporate purposes for the company 
as of december   the scheduled principal payments on all outstanding debt are million  million  million  million  and million for the years ended december  through  respectively  and million thereafter 
the company expects to refinance or extend the majority of the maturities over the next five years through additional company financings and from refinancing the maturing loans 
the company s ability to refinance or extend these loans on or before their due dates depends on the level of income generated by the properties  prevailing interest rates  credit market trends  and other factors that may be in effect at the time of such refinancings or extensions and there is no assurance that such refinancings or extensions will be executed 
the ratios of the company s ebitda to interest paid on total indebtedness exclusive of capitalized interest and interest income for the years ended december    and were to  to  and to  respectively 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  crown investments and its subsidiary have been granted rights  subject to certain restrictions  whereby they may redeem part or all of their common partnership units for common shares  on a one to one basis  or cash at a price equal to the value of the company s common shares 
crown investments has pledged substantially all of its limited partnership units as collateral for a loan it has received from an unrelated third party 
g economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years it has had little impact on the operations of the company during this period 
tenant leases also provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company during highly inflationary periods 
as operating costs increase  most leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants and therefore  the tenants will absorb part of this increased operating cost 
most of the leases provide for percentage rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
thus  during highly inflationary periods  when retail sales at the malls increase  the company should receive additional rental income through percentage rent increases  partially offsetting the effect of inflation 
in periods of an economic slowdown and in light of the recent terroristic activities  the company may be subject to additional risks arising in connection with the underlying real estate  including defaults under or non renewal of tenant leases  bankruptcy of tenants  competition  inability to rent unleased space  lower tenant sales resulting in reduced percentage rents  and higher energy and other operating costs  all resulting in placing increased strain on the company s financial condition 
the use of the internet for retail sales is growing rapidly  but at present is a very minor component of total retail sales distribution in the united states  and particularly of the types of products typically sold in enclosed regional malls 
management of the company does not foresee that internet retailing will have a significant effect on tenant sales or occupancy levels in the foreseeable future 
h forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended 
such statements are based on assumptions and expectations  which may not be realized and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy 
future events and actual results  financial and otherwise  may differ from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
risk and other factors that might cause differences  some of which could be material  include  but are not limited to  economic and credit market conditions  the ability to refinance maturing indebtedness  the impact of competition  consumer buying trends  financing and development risks  construction and lease up delays  cost overruns  the level and volatility of interest rates  the rate of revenue increases versus expense increases and financial stabili ty of tenants within the retail industry  as well as other risks listed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise publicly disseminated by the company 
although management believes that the assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  there are no assurances that the assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct due to the foregoing and other factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk accounts receivable and accounts payable carrying amounts approximate the fair value of the accounts receivable and accounts payable balances  respectively  at december  in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect interest costs associated with million of variable rate debt  which represents of total long term debt  and costs when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in millions year ending december  and thereafter long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate interest rate risk for the company decreased in due to a decrease in variable rate debt from million at december  to  million at december  the company s variable rate debt is based primarily on libor  and the company will incur increasing interest costs if libor increases 
the company has entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate such risks in  and as of december   the company had million of swap agreements outstanding 
except for the changes just mentioned  the market risk exposures are not substantially different from what existed at december  a hypothetical change of in libor  on which the company s variable interest rates are based  would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding at december
