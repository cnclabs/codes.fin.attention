item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered real estate investment trust and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
we own thirty three properties  a leasehold position with respect to one property and we are a member of a joint venture which owns one property 
our properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to adhere to these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  free standing  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we have in the past and intend in the future to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis to finance the purchase of real estate 
our rental properties are generally leased under noncancellable operating leases to corporate tenants 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements which require the tenant to pay not only rent but all the expenses of the leased property including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and others provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
in  the company purchased eight properties in four states for a total consideration of approximately  first mortgages totaling approximately  were placed on five of these properties 
in november  we entered into a joint venture with an affiliate of deutsche bank ag  which acquired a megaplex stadium style movie theater 
we invested approximately  for our participation in the joint venture 
all decisions of the venture are subject to joint control 
under the joint venture operating agreement  a management fee equal to of the rent paid by the tenant is paid to a company controlled by our chairman of the board of directors and certain of our officers 
in  we sold fifteen properties  thirteen of which were sold in a single transaction  which resulted in a gain of approximately  for financial statement purposes 
in  we sold two properties for a total sales price of  and recognized a net gain of  at december   we had twenty three outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating  in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately  before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at rates ranging from to  and mature between and results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues revenues consist primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
rental income increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  primarily because we received rental income from eight properties during the entire year ended december  we acquired these properties at various times during the year ended december  rental income during the year ended december  reflects an  reduction in rental income received during the year ended december  as a result of the sale of thirteen properties in october in november  we entered into a joint venture which acquired a megaplex stadium style theater in norwalk  california 
our equity share of the earnings of this unconsolidated joint venture of  is included in revenues for the year ended december  interest and other income decreased by  to  for the year ended december  due to a reduction in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents available for investment  as cash and cash equivalents were used during the year ended december  to fund property acquisitions 
expenses the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of  to  for the year ended december  resulted primarily from depreciation recorded on the eight properties acquired during the year ended december  the increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of fifteen properties during the year ended december  the increase in interest mortgages payable to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  resulted from mortgages placed on seven properties acquired during interest line of credit was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  resulting from borrowings under the credit facility 
we repaid indebtedness under our line of credit during the year ended december   which had been incurred to facilitate the purchase of several properties during the year ended december   using the proceeds from mortgage financings on two properties purchased in december general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december  these increases resulted from increased costs primarily resulting from the increases in our business activities 
real estate expenses were  in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the write off of leasing commissions  non recurring landlord repairs and certain real estate expenses and taxes not rebilled to tenants 
the results of operations for the year ended december  included a refund of real estate taxes received during that period 
during the year ended december   we determined that the estimated fair value of two properties was lower than their carrying amounts and therefore  we recorded a provision for valuation adjustment of real estate for the difference of  there was no comparable adjustment during the year ended december gain on sale of real estate gain on sale of real estate during the year ended december  resulted from the sale of a property in august at a gain of  offset in part by a  loss on a sale of property in may gain on sale of real estate during the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of thirteen total petroleum locations which resulted in a gain of  for financial statement purposes

we also recognized a gain of  on the sale of a property in may and a gain of  on the sale of a property in february liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our  revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities 
on march  we entered into an agreement with european american bank now citibank na to provide a  revolving credit facility 
we use the facility primarily to finance the acquisition of commercial real estate 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate and there is an unused facility fee of one quarter of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinance of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries which own unencumbered properties and secured by the outstanding stock of all of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no indebtedness outstanding under the facility 
we  on our own behalf  and on behalf of our joint venture with an affiliate of deutsche bank  ag  are involved in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of additional net leased properties 
the joint venture  which will only acquire theater properties has agreed to acquire a screen theater located in a suburb of dayton  ohio for a total consideration of  our equity investment will approximate  we will use cash provided from operations and our credit facility to fund this and other acquisitions 
the joint venture will likely seek mortgage financing secured by properties owned and acquired by it 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to shareholders in order for us to maintain our real estate investment trust status under the internal revenue code

the debt service due for the next two years will be paid from operations 
loan maturities of approximately  due from to years will be paid predominately from mortgage financings or refinancings 
we have no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  we intend to expand our investment activities either through our joint venture or independently in the near future 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in varying levels of discussions with respect to the acquisition of additional properties 
we expect that in order to execute our expansion program  we will have to identify and obtain a significant amount of additional capital  either through increased debt or additional equity 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code since our organization 
to qualify as a real estate investment trust  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our real estate investment trust status 
as a real estate investment trust  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a real estate investment trust for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a real estate investment trust  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
it is our intention to pay to our shareholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of securities 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  includes rental income that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
at december   management has not taken a reserve or direct write off against the unbilled rent receivable of  value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  its location  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
we also ascertain appropriate capitalization rates for the real estate asset in the area in which the property is located and apply such capitalization rate to the net operating income derived from that asset 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
a  valuation adjustment was recorded in there was no valuation adjustment recorded in certain relationships and allocated expenses we note the following relationships fredric h
