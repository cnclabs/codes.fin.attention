item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a provider of server appliance hardware platforms and custom integration services 
server appliances are pre configured computer network infrastructure devices designed to deliver specific application functionality 
we are focused on partnering with independent software vendors isvs and original equipment manufacturers oems to provide these strategic partners with server appliance hardware  integration services and appliance development  deployment and support to allow these strategic partners to deliver turn key solutions to their end user customers 
when we first entered the server appliance market  we focused our business primarily on providing scalable web content servers to internet based organizations  content infrastructure providers and larger enterprises 
it was necessary for us to design most of the hardware components that went into our servers and  as a result  we invested significant resources in the development of our products 
in june  we introduced the first u inch tall server  the webengine blazer 
after the introduction of our webengine blazer product  we experienced significant growth as we invested in the development of our technology and products  the recruitment and training of personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and technical support departments  and the establishment of an administrative organization 
as a result  our employee base grew from as of june  to as of march   and our operating expenses grew significantly 
over time  much of the hardware components of server appliances became commoditized and a significant number of companies entered the server appliance marketplace 
in response to competitive pressures combined with the effects of a downturn in the economy  which had a significant negative impact on our new economy customers  we implemented a restructuring plan in the quarter ended june  to better align our operating expenses with our reduced revenues 
this restructuring plan resulted in a million charge to operations in april  a employee reduction in our workforce  as well as the curtailment of planned facility expansion and other cost cutting measures 
we further undertook an extensive review of our business strategy and  in july  we implemented a second restructuring of our business  which de emphasized much of our customized hardware and software development and focused our resources on what we believe to be our core competencies of hardware packaging  software integration and supply chain management 
in addition  this restructuring of our business included a transition from primarily direct sales channels to partnerships with isvs and oems in order to allow them to offer turn key server appliance solutions to enterprise customers 
the implementation of our july restructuring plan included a reduction in our workforce from employees to employees 
we incurred a charge to operations of approximately million in the quarter ended september  as we executed our july restructuring plan 
in an effort to further streamline our operations  we reduced our workforce by employees during the year ended september  as a result of this workforce reduction  we recorded a charge to operations of  during the year ended september  as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our revenues are derived from sales of our server appliance hardware platforms 
we recognize revenues upon shipment  provided evidence of an arrangement has been received  no obligations remain outstanding and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales to date have been to customers in the united states 

table of contents in the past  we generated a portion of our net revenues from license arrangements  which allowed certain customers to sell our webengine blazer product under their name in exchange for per unit fees 
we recognized license revenues upon the licensee s sale to its customers 
we do not anticipate future revenues from license revenue arrangements 
gross profit loss represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  manufacturing costs  manufacturing personnel expenses  obsolescence charges  packaging  license fees and shipping and warranty costs 
our gross profit loss is affected by the amount of our isv revenues in relation to our oem revenues  our product pricing and the timing  size and configuration of customer orders 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we believe that a significant level of investment in product development is required to remain competitive and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to product development 
however  we expect research and development expenses to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal as we continue our transition away from the internal development of significant proprietary hardware and software 
as of september   there were employees in research and development 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations and marketing materials 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars during fiscal as we expand our sales and marketing efforts to increase our market presence 
as of september   there were employees in sales  marketing and customer support 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as accounting  legal  other professional fees and administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company and provisions for doubtful accounts 
we expect general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal there were general and administrative employees as of september  we recorded deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet of million in connection with stock option and restricted stock grants to our employees and directors that were granted between february  and june  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes at the date of grant 
we are amortizing this stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options 
all options granted subsequent to june  have been issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock and  accordingly  no additional deferred compensation has been recorded 
through september   we amortized million to stock compensation expense and million of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of unvested options held by terminated employees 

table of contents we recorded million of deferred compensation on our balance sheet as a result of restricted stock issued to the former employees of ip performance  inc ip performance who were retained as our employees in connection with our acquisition of ip performance in november the restricted stock was to vest annually through november contingent upon continued employment  resulting in million of amortization in fiscal during fiscal  we terminated the employment of all of the former ip performance employees 
in accordance with the restricted stock agreements  all of the remaining unvested restricted stock vested upon termination 
as a result  during the year ended september   we recognized the remaining deferred stock compensation of approximately million 
we expect quarterly stock compensation amortization of approximately  during fiscal and an aggregate of approximately  thereafter 
the amount of stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could change if restricted stock or options for accrued but unvested compensation are forfeited 
recent events on november   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire tidalwire  inc tidalwire  a privately held corporation dedicated to the distribution and support of storage networking products 
the acquisition will be effected through a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary into tidalwire 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions  including the approval of our stockholders and the stockholders of tidalwire 
a special meeting of our stockholders is scheduled to take place on december  and we expect to close this acquisition as soon as practicable thereafter and after the satisfaction of the other conditions to closing  which we expect to occur by the end of december accordingly  any forward looking statements we make in this annual report on form k do not reflect the impact the acquisition of tidalwire will have on our business and operations if the acquisition is consummated 
at september   we had a sub lease agreement related to certain office space previously occupied by us see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the non cancellable sub lease agreement provides for the payment of approximately  of rental payments to us during the period from october  through march  on december   we began discussions with this sub tenant to renegotiate the terms of the sub lease agreement 
we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending september  as a result of these renegotiation discussions 
we do not have the ability to estimate the amount of the charge at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  amounts which are recorded as restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense  and income tax asset valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue from sales of our products upon shipment to customers provided persuasive evidence of the arrangement has been received  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and all other revenue recognition criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements are met 
at the time of a sale transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is only recognized at that time if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  management considers customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience 
our customers are not granted rights to return our products after the purchase has been made 
however  in certain circumstances  we have accepted returns  although we were not contractually obligated to do so 
we record a provision for potential returns based on our historical return rate 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes judgments or uses estimates that prove to be materially different from actual experiences 
we offer a warranty on all of our products that generally provide for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
based upon historical experience and expectation of future conditions  we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty reserve may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
in addition  when evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider customer concentrations and current economic trends 
while such actual bad debts recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  we cannot be sure that we will continue to be able to estimate our future experience with the same success 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future  giving effect to general market conditions 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
furthermore  if our estimates of future product demand prove to be inaccurate  additional reserves may be required for incremental excess and obsolete inventory 
restructuring and other charges involuntary termination benefits and exit costs are recognized when management approves and commits to a sufficiently detailed plan of termination or exit plan 
management must assess whether costs incurred in connection with involuntary terminations and exit activities meet certain specific requirements to be recorded and classified as restructuring and other costs 
during compilation of a plan of termination or exit plan  we make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain costs contained in these plans based on information gathered from internal and external sources 
if actual results related to any of these assumptions or estimates were to exceed or not meet our expectations in the future  we may need to adjust certain restructuring and other charges in future reporting periods  resulting in increased or decreased operating expenses 
stock compensation in connection with the grant of certain options and restricted stock awards to employees issued prior to our initial public offering in july  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options or restricted stock awards at the date of grant 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the proper valuation of deferred stock compensation because at the time of grant there was no available market for our common stock 
different assumptions would have yielded materially different results 
income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one period or over several periods 

table of contents results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations as a percentage of net revenues for each of the past three fiscal years 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
net product revenues net license revenues total net revenues cost of product revenues cost of license revenues cost of revenues stock compensation inventory write down total cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative stock compensation restructuring and other charges amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net net loss years ended september  and net revenues net revenues increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase is due to higher sales volumes as a result of sales to a large oem customer in the year ended september  for which there was no comparable customer during the year ended september  during the year ended september   this customer accounted for of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues is partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our products due to the high concentration of oem revenues during the year ended september  as well as a decrease in license revenues during the year ended september  license revenues in the year ended september  were immaterial and we do not expect significant future license revenues 
gross profit loss in the year ended september   we had a gross profit of million  an increase from a gross loss of million in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we recorded a net inventory write down of approximately million for which there was no corresponding charge in the year ended september  the inventory write down resulted 
table of contents from an unanticipated decline in sales during the year ended september   as well as a high level of inventory and firm inventory commitments compared to our reduced expectations for future product sales at that time 
excluding the inventory write down and stock compensation  gross profit increased to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended september  from a gross profit of million  or of net revenues  in the year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in product sales volume  lower per unit materials costs and lower manufacturing costs  all of which occurred during the year ended september  the lower per unit materials cost was due to our increased use of standard off the shelf components in our products and a change in the mix of customer product configurations 
lower manufacturing costs were the result of the restructurings that we implemented in fiscal a decrease in license revenues during the year ended september  partially offset the increase in gross profit 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this decrease was due primarily to decreased compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our research and development group  which was as high as employees prior to our april and july restructurings  decreased to employees at september  the decrease in research and development expenses is also due to decreases in consulting  prototype and test unit costs as we have increased the use of standard off the shelf components in our products  which has reduced the need to build prototype and test units and has allowed us to utilize fewer consultants in our product development process 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this decrease was due primarily to decreased compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our sales  marketing and customer support group  which was as high as employees prior to the april and july restructurings  decreased to employees at september  the decrease was also due to a significant reduction in spending on marketing programs  as we did not attend any trade show or incur advertising expenses in the year ended september  to a lesser extent  decreased travel costs also contributed to the decrease in selling and marketing expenses during the year ended september  as a result of the decrease in sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower bad debt expenses during the year ended september  during the year ended september   we recognized a significant bad debt expense as a result of the economic down turn during that time period and the concentration of our customers in the dot com sector  which was significantly affected by the overall economy 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is also attributable to lower compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our general and administrative group  which was as high as employees prior to the april and july restructurings  decreased to employees as of september  in addition  the decrease in general and administrative expenses 
table of contents is also due to lower consulting and professional service fees  which was somewhat offset by a charge to settle a lawsuit of less than  which was previously filed against us on december  by a former employee 
stock compensation 
we recognized stock compensation expense of million and million in the year ended september  and  respectively  related to the grant of options and restricted stock to employees and directors prior to our initial public offering in fiscal and in connection with restricted stock issued to employees as a result of our acquisition of ip performance  inc  in november the decrease in stock compensation expense in the year ended september  is the result of forfeitures of unvested options and restricted stock with unrecognized compensation previously held by terminated employees for which stock compensation expense is no longer being recognized 
during the year ended september   we terminated the employment of all of the remaining employees of ip performance  inc in accordance with the restricted stock agreements with these individuals  all of the related restricted stock vested upon termination and all of the remaining deferred stock compensation of million was accelerated and recorded in the year ended september   which partially offset the decrease in stock compensation 
restructuring and other charges 
during the year ended september   we undertook two restructurings of our operations  the first of these restructurings occurred in april and the second in july in the april restructuring  we sought to better align our operating expenses with reduced revenues  and as a result of the implementation  we recorded a charge to operations of million 
this charge was due to a reduction in workforce from employees to employees  the curtailment of a planned expansion into leased facilities and other items 
this charge included approximately million for employee related costs including severance payments to terminated employees and stock option compensation expense related to modifications of certain stock options held by terminated employees  approximately million to write off certain assets related to facilities that we will not be occupying and approximately  primarily related to non refundable deposits on tradeshows we did not attend as well as costs for certain other non cancellable sales and marketing commitments 
the july restructuring was the result of an intensive review of our business  which resulted in a refocus of the sales strategy toward strategic partnerships with isvs and oems and a discontinuation of much of the customized hardware and software that was previously included in our products 
as a result of the implementation of the july restructuring  we recorded a charge to operations of approximately million 
this charge included approximately million of employee related costs as we reduced our workforce by employees  approximately million as a result of our disposal of certain property and equipment  approximately million to write off goodwill and intangible assets which were deemed to be impaired  approximately  of facility costs associated with non cancelable operating leases for space which will not be occupied and approximately  of other charges 
in addition to the april and july restructurings  in march we recorded a charge due to the retirement of fixed assets related to our webengine blazer product line 
these fixed assets had a total net book value of approximately million and consisted primarily of computer equipment previously utilized in the production and sales of the webengine blazer  one of our previous generation web content server appliance products 
the total of the restructuring and other charges detailed above was approximately million recorded for the year ended september  the reduction in our workforce implemented during the year ended september  impacted employees in all of our groups  including manufacturing  research and 
table of contents development  selling and marketing and general and administrative 
we realized approximately million in cost savings in fiscal as a result of our fiscal restructurings 
during the year ended september   we implemented an additional restructuring 
in an effort to further streamline operations  we reduced our workforce by employees  which impacted employees in all of our groups 
the implementation of this reduction in workforce resulted in a charge of  to operations  which is comprised entirely of employee related charges  including severance payments to terminated employees 
we expect to realize annualized cost savings of approximately million as a result of this restructuring 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisition of ip performance  inc in november  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of million  of which we amortized  in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we completed an intensive review of our business  which resulted in the implementation of a restructuring plan 
as a result of this restructuring and an assessment of expected future cash flows  we determined that the recoverability of intangible assets resulting from our purchase of ip performance  inc was unlikely 
accordingly  we recognized an impairment charge in the july restructuring for the full amount of the remaining unamortized intangible assets  approximately million  during the year ended september  interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net decreased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this decrease was due to lower average interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and a lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance during the year ended september  as a result of utilizing cash and cash equivalents to fund our net operating losses incurred since our initial public offering in july years ended september  and net revenues net revenues decreased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in product sales volumes as a result of the general economic slowdown and its significant negative impact on the information technology spending of our new economy customer base 
to a lesser extent  the decline in net revenues during the year ended september  is the result of a decrease in license revenues recognized as well as a lower average selling price of our products due to increased competitive pricing pressure 
gross profit loss gross profit loss decreased to a loss of million for the year ended september  from a profit of million in the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a net charge of approximately million to write down excess and obsolete 
table of contents inventory in the year ended september   for which there was no comparable charge in the year ended september  the inventory write down resulted from an unanticipated decline in sales during the year ended september   as well as a high level of inventory and firm inventory commitments compared to our reduced expectations for future product sales 
excluding the inventory write down  and stock compensation  gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended september  from million  or of net revenues  in the year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in product sales volumes and a decrease in license revenues recognized during the year ended september  to a lesser extent  the decrease in gross profit loss is the result of a lower average selling price of our products due to competitive pricing pressure in the year ended september  operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to increased compensation costs as research and development personnel increased from employees at september  to during fiscal prior to the april and july restructurings 
at september   we had employees in research and development 
to a lesser extent  the increase in research and development expenses was due to expenses related to the development of our webengine sierra  storagearray and applianceengine products  as well as our storageengine voyager product  which was discontinued in connection with the july restructuring 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to increased salary costs as a result of the increase in our sales  marketing and customer support personnel to a peak of employees during the year ended september  from employees at september  as of september   we had employees in our sales  marketing and customer support organization 
in addition  the increase in selling and marketing expenses is also attributable to increased travel costs as a result of the changes in sales  marketing and customer support personnel during fiscal and facilities related costs as a result of a full year of expenses associated with the expansion of our canton headquarters  which occurred during may these increases were partially offset by decreases in commissions and bonuses as a result of the decrease in revenue during fiscal  recruiting costs and trade show expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense as a result of the general economic slowdown over the past twelve months and the resulting effect that it had on our new economy customers 
in addition  the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to increased compensation costs as general and administrative personnel increased from employees at september  to a peak of employees during the year ended september  and ended at employees  as of september  this increase was also due to increased insurance costs associated with our operation as a public company and increased consulting and professional service fees 
stock compensation

table of contents options and restricted stock to employees and directors during fiscal and prior to our initial public offering in fiscal in connection with restricted stock issued to employees as a result of our acquisition of ip performance  inc  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million  of which we recognized million as stock compensation expense during the year ended september  restructuring and other charges

in connection with the acquisition of ip performance  inc in november  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of million  of which we amortized  in the year ended september  in july  we completed an intensive review of our business  which resulted in the implementation of a restructuring plan 
this restructuring plan included a discontinuation of much of the customized hardware and software that had previously been a part of our product development process 
as a result of this restructuring and an assessment of expected future cash flows  we determined that the recoverability of intangible assets resulting from our purchase of ip performance  inc was unlikely 
we recognized an impairment charge for the full amount of the unamortized intangible assets  approximately million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense net increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was due to a higher average cash balance as a result of the investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in july liquidity and capital resources since fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and the sale of our products 
on july   we completed our initial public offering by selling  shares of common stock  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of  shares  at per share and raised approximately million  net of offering costs and underwriting fees totaling approximately million

as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding restricted cash of million 
cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended september   and  respectively

in august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in non solicited privately negotiated transactions 
in november  we completed the stock repurchase program 
through the end of this program  we repurchased approximately  shares of common stock for approximately million of cash and repurchased approximately  shares of common stock in exchange for the retirement of approximately  of stockholder notes receivable 
as a result of the fiscal and restructurings  we are obligated to make additional cash payments of approximately  over the next twelve months 
we anticipate that funds required to make all restructuring payments will be available from our current working capital 
we believe that the restructuring actions undertaken during fiscal will result in cost savings of approximately million during fiscal on january   we deposited million of cash with a bank to guarantee a personal loan of lawrence a 
genovesi  our current chairman and former president  chief executive office and chief technology officer 
the guarantee period  as amended  ends on january   at which time the balance of the amount deposited with the bank  which is not required to satisfy any obligations under the guarantee  will be returned to us

pending approval of this acquisition by both our stockholders and tidalwire s stockholders  we expect to close this acquisition at the end of december in connection with this acquisition  we estimate that we will incur transaction related expenses of approximately  the amount of cash paid by us to the stockholders of tidalwire may be adjusted based upon tidalwire s working capital as of the closing of the merger or if tidalwire s transaction costs exceed our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including our ability to form an adequate number of strategic partnerships with isvs and oems  the level of success of our strategic isv and oem partners in selling server appliance solutions that include our server appliance hardware platforms  the costs associated with any merger and acquisition activities  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  the costs involved in obtaining  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  business combinations and sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas requires  among other things  the cessation of the amortization of goodwill 
in addition  sfas includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires the completion of a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning on october  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas supersedes sfas  however  it retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for segments of a business to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains apb s requirement that entities report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends the guidance of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
eitf allowed for an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that liabilities recorded in connection with exit plans be initially measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
it also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  and the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we are faced with 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that are currently deemed immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risk related to revenue concentration 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from one oem customer  and our revenues may decline significantly if this customer cancels or delays purchases of our products  terminates their contract with us  or exercises certain of their other rights under the terms of the contract 
in the year ended september   one customer accounted for of our net revenues 
under the terms of our non exclusive contract with this customer  the customer has the right to enter into agreements with other parties for similar products  the customer is not obligated to purchase any minimum quantity of products from us and the customer may choose to stop purchasing from us at any time 
in addition  the customer may terminate the agreement in the event that we attempt to assign its rights under the agreement to another party without the customer s prior approval 
furthermore  in the event that we default on certain portions of the agreement and do not cure during the prescribed cure period  the customer may obtain the right to manufacture the products defined in the agreement in exchange for a mutually agreeable royalty fee 
if any of these events were to occur  or if this customer delays purchases of our products  our revenues and operating results would be adversely affected  our reputation in the industry may suffer and our ability to predict cash flow accurately would decrease 
accordingly  unless and until we expand and diversify our revenue base  our future success will depend upon the timing and size of future purchase orders  if any  from this customer 

table of contents risks related to business strategy 
if we fail to form a significant enough number of strategic partnerships with independent software vendors and original equipment manufacturers  we may be unable to generate significant sustainable revenues and our operations could be materially adversely affected and  as a result  we may choose to discontinue one or more of the components of our business strategy 
a major component of our business strategy is to focus our sales and marketing efforts on indirect sales through strategic partnerships with isvs and oems 
to date  we have not entered into a significant number of definitive agreements with isvs and oems 
we may not be able to develop a significant number of strategic partnerships with isvs and oems and  even if we are successful in developing strategic partnerships with isvs and oems  this strategy may fail to generate sufficient revenues to offset the demands that this strategy will place on our business 
a failure to generate significant revenues from strategic partnerships could materially adversely affect our operations and  as a result  we may choose to discontinue one or more of the components of our business strategy 
we changed our product strategy during fiscal there can be no assurance that the change in our product strategy will have the intended effect on our business 
our product strategy is to concentrate resources on our core competencies  which we believe to be hardware platform packaging and the ability to integrate hardware platforms with various operating systems  management systems and application software systems 
this strategy includes a transformation of our product development process from one requiring significant proprietary hardware development to one utilizing standard hardware 
there can be no assurance that our product strategy will have a positive effect on operations  market share  the market price of our common stock or public perception of us in the server appliance marketplace  or that we will ever achieve substantial revenues or profitability 
risks related to the server appliance market 
if server appliances are not increasingly adopted as a solution to meet companies computer application needs  the market for our products may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of lower revenues or reduced investor expectations 
we expect that substantially all of our revenues will come from sales of server appliance platforms and customized integration services 
as a result  we depend on the growing use of server appliances to meet businesses computer application needs 
the market for server appliance products has only recently begun to develop and we believe it is evolving rapidly 
because this market is new  we cannot predict its potential size or future growth rate with a high degree of certainty 
our revenues may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline if the server appliance market does not grow rapidly 
we believe that our expectations for the growth of the server appliance market may not be fulfilled if customers continue to use general purpose servers 
the role of our products could  for example  be limited if general purpose servers become better at performing functions currently being performed by server appliances or are offered at a lower cost 
this could force us to further lower the prices of our products or result in fewer sales of our products 

table of contents server appliance products are subject to rapid technological change due to changing operating system software and network hardware and software configurations  and our sales will suffer if our products are rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the server appliance market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  potentially short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
our future success depends upon our ability to utilize our creative packaging and hardware and software integration skills to combine industry standard hardware and software to produce low cost  high performance products that satisfy our strategic partners requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
risks related to competition 
if we are not able to effectively compete against providers of general purpose servers  specific purpose servers or other server appliance providers  our revenues will not increase and may decrease 
in the server appliance market  we face significant competition from a number of different types of companies 
our competitors include companies who market general purpose servers  specific purpose servers and server appliances as well as companies that sell custom integration services utilizing hardware produced by other companies 
many of these companies are larger than us and have greater financial resources and name recognition than us as well as significant distribution capabilities and larger  more established service organizations to support their products 
our large competitors may be able to leverage their existing resources  including their extensive distribution capabilities and their service organizations  to provide a wider offering of products and services as well as higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
in addition  competing companies may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive terms to their customers than we can 
if our competitors provide lower cost solutions with greater functionality or support than our products  or if some of their products are comparable to ours and are offered as part of a range of products that is broader than ours  our products could become undesirable 
even if the functionality of competing products is equivalent to ours  we face a substantial risk that a significant number of customers would elect to pay a premium for similar functionality rather than purchase products from a less established vendor 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competition by offering a wide variety of software integration  branding  supply chain management and fulfillment services 
if we are unable to effectively differentiate our products from those of our competition  our revenues will not increase and may decline 
furthermore  increased competition could negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our revenues could be negatively affected if our larger competitors make acquisitions in order to join their extensive distribution capabilities with our smaller competitors products 
large server manufacturers may not only develop their own server appliance solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our smaller competitors  including smaller 
table of contents private companies 
because large server manufacturers have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the server appliance market by leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies and utilizing their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the server industry will experience further consolidation 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share through consolidation 
consolidation within the server marketplace could adversely affect our revenues 
we may sell fewer products if other vendors products are no longer compatible with our products or other vendors bundle their products with those of our competitors and sell them at lower prices 
our ability to sell our products depends in part on the compatibility of our products with other vendors software and hardware products 
developers of these products may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
these other vendors may also decide to bundle their products with other server appliances for promotional purposes and discount the sales price of the bundle 
if that were to happen  our business and future operating results could suffer if we were no longer able to offer commercially viable products 
risks related to financial results 
we have a history of losses and expect to experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining further 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  including net losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to have net losses in the future 
in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of september  we believe that any future growth will require us to incur significant engineering  selling and marketing and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or  if we achieve profitability  that we will be able to sustain it 
if we do not achieve and maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to the timing and size of orders from customers  a lack of growth of the server appliance market in general or the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from customers  particularly our largest oem  and because server appliances generally  and our current products in particular  are relatively new and the future growth of the market for our products is uncertain 
we also expect to rely on additional new products for growth in our net revenues in the future 
in addition  none of our customers are obligated to purchase any quantity of our products in the future 
if the timing or size of orders from customers  particularly our largest oem  differs from expectations  the server appliance market in general fails to grow as expected or our products fail to achieve market acceptance  our quarterly net revenues and operating results may fall below the expectations of investors and public market research analysts 
in this event  the market price for our common stock could decline 

table of contents if the commoditization of products and competition in the server appliance market increases  then our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decrease and our operating results may suffer 
products and services in the server appliance market may be subject to further commoditization as the industry matures and other businesses introduce more competing products and services 
the gross margin as a percentage of revenues of our products is already low  and may not grow to our targeted gross margin percentages or may even decrease  in response to changes in our product mix  competitive pricing pressures  or new product introductions into the server appliance marketplace 
if we are unable to offset decreases in our gross margins as a percentage of revenues by increasing our sales volumes  operating results will decline 
changes in the mix of sales of our products  including the mix of higher margin sales of products sold in smaller quantities and somewhat lower margin sales of products sold in larger quantities  could adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
to maintain our gross margins  we also must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
our efforts to produce higher margin products  continue to improve our products and produce new products may make it difficult to reduce our manufacturing cost per product 
further  utilization of a contract manufacturer may not allow us to reduce our cost per product 
risks related to marketing and sales efforts 
we need to effectively manage our sales and marketing operations to increase market awareness and sales of our products 
if we fail to do so  our growth  if any  will be limited 
during april and july  we significantly reduced our selling and marketing personnel in an attempt to reduce operating expenses and to conserve cash 
although we have fewer selling and marketing personnel  we must continue to increase market awareness and sales of our products 
if we fail in this endeavor  our growth  if any  will be limited 
efforts to promote our brand may not result in the desired brand recognition by existing or potential isv and oem customers or in increased sales 
in the fast growing market for server appliance solutions  we believe that we need a strong brand to compete successfully 
in order to attract and retain isv and oem customers  we believe that the network engines brand must be recognized and viewed favorably by isvs and oems 
during fiscal  we reduced our marketing programs 
if we are unable to design and implement effective marketing campaigns or otherwise fail to promote and maintain the network engines brand  sales may not increase and our business may be adversely affected 
our business may also suffer if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining the network engines brand but fail to achieve the expected or desired increase in revenues 
if we are unable to effectively manage our customer service and support activities  we may not be able to retain our existing isv and oem customers and attract new isv and oem customers 
we have a small customer service and support organization 
we need to effectively manage our customer support operations to ensure that we maintain good relationships with our customers 
if our customer support organization is unsuccessful in maintaining good customer relationships  we may lose customers to our competitors and our reputation in the market could be damaged 
as a result  we may lose revenue and incur losses greater than expected 

table of contents risks related to product manufacturing 
if we do not accurately forecast our component requirements  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors including specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for those components 
in addition  a variety of factors  including the timing of product releases  potential delays or cancellations of orders and the timing of large orders  make it difficult to predict product orders 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase costs and negatively impact our cash position 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
our dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components makes us susceptible to supply shortages that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and could result in lost sales or customers 
we depend upon single source and limited source suppliers for our industry standard processors  main logic boards  certain disk drives  and power supplies as well as our internally developed heat pipe  chassis and sheet metal parts 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  shortages of or difficulties in acquiring components needed to produce our products 
shortages have been of limited duration and have not yet caused material delays in production of our products 
however  shortages in supply of these key components for an extended time would cause delays in the production of our products  prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations and meeting customer expectations  and result in lost sales or customers 
if we are unable to buy components that we need or if we are unable to buy components at acceptable prices  we will not be able to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely or cost effective basis to our customers 
our future success is dependent on our ability to expand production capacity 
our existing manufacturing facility is limited in its production capacity 
for us to be successful our product sales volumes must increase significantly 
our production capacity must increase to support significant increases in product sales volumes 
in order to increase our production capacity  we may have to utilize the services of a contract manufacturer to produce our products at high volumes 
we may have difficulties in identifying and engaging a contract manufacturer to produce our products with terms that are favorable to us 
using a contract manufacturer may increase the cost of producing products and we could experience transitional difficulties including production delays and quality control issues  which could cause customer relationships to suffer and result in lost sales 
also  the use of a contract manufacturer may not guarantee us production levels  manufacturing line space or manufacturing prices  which could interrupt our business operations and have a negative effect on operating results 

table of contents risks related to product dependence on intellectual property and use of the network engines brand 
our reliance upon contractual provisions  domestic patent  copyright and trademark laws and applied for patents to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products 
certain of our products are differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed software and hardware and the manner in which they are integrated into our products 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we believe that the steps we have taken to safeguard our intellectual property afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own 
despite the precautions we have taken  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that any of our patent applications will result in patents  or that any such patents would provide effective protection of our technology 
in addition  the laws of the countries in which we decide to market our services and solutions may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we have invested substantial resources in developing our products and the network engines brand  and our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that resulted in a significant damages award 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights and brand names exists in our industry 
we expect that server appliance products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in the industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
from time to time we receive claims from third parties that our products have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that our products employ technology that infringes any proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may make claims that we have infringed upon their proprietary rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  including potential liability for damages  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or the failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the impacted product without redeveloping it or incurring significant additional expenses 

table of contents risks relating to our pending acquisition of tidalwire  inc failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our future business and operations 
our acquisition of tidalwire is subject to certain closing conditions  including the approval of the stockholders of each of network engines and tidalwire and other customary closing conditions 
if we do not complete the acquisition for any reason  we will be subject to a number of risks  including the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed  our costs related to the merger  such as legal  accounting and investment banking fees  must be paid even if the acquisition is not completed  and benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition would not be realized 
we may not be able to successfully integrate tidalwire into our operations 
the integration of tidalwire into our operations involves a number of risks  including difficulty integrating tidalwire s operations and personnel  diversion of management attention  potential disruption of ongoing business  inability to retain key personnel  inability to successfully incorporate tidalwire s products and services into our product and service offerings and to develop new products and services  and impairment of relationships with employees  customers or vendors 
combined company will have increased dependence on a strategic partner 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from one oem customer 
tidalwire relies on reference sales originating from that same oem for a significant amount of its revenue 
although tidalwire does not sell a significant amount of products directly to the oem  it is one of two north american distributors that this oem refers its customers to for the supply of data storage network components that have been authorized for use in this oem s data storage networks 
because of this relationship  tidalwire receives favorable pricing from the suppliers of these authorized data storage components and is able to realize higher gross margins on the sale of this product 
the products that we sell to the oem and the data storage components that tidalwire distributes to resellers and other customers are unrelated and mutually exclusive of each other 
if the merger is consummated  the combined company will depend on this oem to an even greater extent 
if this oem partner were to discontinue purchasing network engines products from the combined company or stop referring its customers to the combined company for authorized data storage components  or introduce more authorized distributors for the data storage components that tidalwire distributes  then the combined company s revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 

table of contents other risks related to our business 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us  our chairman and one of our executive officers 
on or about december   a class action lawsuit was filed against us  our chairman  one of our executive officers and the underwriters of our initial public offering 
we are unable to predict the effects of this suit  or other similar suits  on our financial condition and business and  although we maintain certain insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that this claim will not result in substantial monetary damages in excess of such insurance coverage 
in addition  we may expend significant resources to defend this case 
this class action lawsuit  or other similar suits  could negatively impact both our financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
if the market price of our common stock is not quoted on a national exchange  our ability to raise future capital may be hindered and the market price of our common stock may be negatively impacted 
the market price of our common stock has declined since our fiscal year and at times has been less than per share 
if we are unable to meet the stock price listing requirements of nasdaq  our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock were de listed from the nasdaq national market  among other things  this could result in a number of negative implications  including reduced liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with nasdaq and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers  customers and employees  the loss of analyst coverage and institutional investor interest  fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing 
if our products fail to perform properly and conform to specifications  our customers may demand refunds or assert claims for damages and our reputation and operating results may suffer 
because our server appliance hardware platforms are complex  they could contain errors that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
in the past we have discovered errors in some of our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors or we have had to replace defective products that were already shipped 
these delays and replacements have principally related to new product releases 
errors in our products may be found in the future and any of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of engineering resources  injury to our reputation  or increased maintenance and warranty costs 
these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
product errors or delays could be material  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of new products or the versions of our products that support windows or unix based operating systems 

table of contents while we attempt to limit our risk contractually  if our products fail to conform to warranted specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our products may be used in connection with critical computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could exceed our insurance coverage and require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any claims for damages  even if unsuccessful  could seriously damage our reputation and business 
if we fail to retain appropriate levels of qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to develop and introduce our products on a timely basis 
we require the services of qualified technical personnel 
we have experienced the negative effects of an economic slowdown 
our revenues have declined significantly since our fiscal year ended september  and the market price of our common stock has decreased significantly 
as a result  we have implemented various personnel reductions  which have placed added pressure on the remaining employees and management 
these and other factors may make it difficult for us to retain the qualified employees and management that we need to effectively manage our business operations  including key engineering activities 
if we are unable to retain a sufficient number of technical personnel we may not be able to complete development of  or upgrade or enhance  our products in a timely manner or successfully integrate our isv partners software with our hardware platforms  which could negatively impact our business and could hinder any future growth 
our stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control that may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock for a profit 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the decline in the market price of our common stock and market conditions generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital  to complete future acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and to attract and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing personnel 
future sales by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

table of contents we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and  without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  will have the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over the rights of the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the issuance of this preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
in addition  provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  second amended and restated by laws and equity compensation plans may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of our business 
if we do not retain our senior management  we may not be able to successfully execute our business plan 
as a result of past restructurings  we have lost members of our management team 
the loss of key members of our current management team could harm us 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of our senior management team 
because of their ability and experience  we may not be able to implement successfully our business strategy if we were to lose one or more of these individuals 
we may need additional capital that may not be available to us and  if raised  may dilute our existing investors ownership interests 
we may need to raise additional funds to develop or enhance our services and solutions  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
additional financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore  do not believe we are subject to exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest excess cash balances in cash equivalents 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material
