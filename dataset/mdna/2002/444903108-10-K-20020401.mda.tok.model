item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading genomics and biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutic product development and functional analysis of genes using our proprietary technology platform 
we discover  develop and intend to commercialize novel compounds for treating and diagnosing human disease based on the identification and study of genes 
we focus our internal product development efforts on therapeutic proteins  antibodies  peptides and fusion proteins and we use collaborations for the development of gene therapy products and small molecule drugs 
we have discovered a large number of genes through our genomics capabilities and have developed a rapidly evolving product pipeline based on our discoveries 
we have seven products  including three therapeutic proteins  one antibody and three albumin fusion products that we have advanced into human clinical trials  two products are awaiting approval from fda to enter human clinical trials  a tenth product  a gene therapy product based on a gene we discovered  has been licensed to vascular genetics  inc vgi and is in human clinical trials being conducted by vgi  an eleventh product  an enzyme that lowers levels of lipoprotein associated phospholipase a lp pla  was discovered by glaxosmithkline gsk as part of our collaboration with gsk and is also in human clinical trials being conducted by gsk 
we have a number of additional products in preclinical development 
we have extensive capabilities in gene discovery  intellectual property protection and preclinical and clinical development and have established a manufacturing capability for the preparation of our proteins  antibodies and fusion proteins for human studies 
we intend to add sales and marketing as appropriate and are currently adding additional manufacturing capabilities 
we have established strategic partnerships with a number of leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage our capabilities and gain access to complementary technologies and sales and marketing infrastructure 
some of these partnerships provide us with research funding and milestone payments  along with royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
we are also entitled to certain co promotion  co development  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and do not anticipate revenues from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years 
from inception through december   we have received million in revenue  million in equity payments and million in a milestone payment pursuant to our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline  payments of million from additional collaboration partners and an aggregate of million from other collaborators  including common stock from transgene sa valued at million  million from pioneer hi bred international  inc  million from pharmacia upjohn company  million from schering plough in addition to certain payments received from schering plough pursuant to our additional collaboration partner agreements  million from f 
hoffmann la roche  million from oravax merieux co 
and merieux oravax snc  and million from medimmune 
to date  we have received all of our revenue from payments made under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and  to a lesser extent  other agreements 
the glaxosmithkline collaboration agreement and many of our other collaboration agreements expired in and will only generate additional milestone and royalty payments if our collaborators successfully develop drugs based on our technology 
we may not receive any of these payments and may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we expect that our revenue sources for at least the next several years may be limited to interest income  payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  payments from the sale of product rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and increasing losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows we carry our cash  cash equivalents  investments  other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other accrued expenses at their respective fair values 
our other assets include deferred financing costs relating to our convertible subordinated notes 
we are amortizing these costs over the life of the notes and  in the event the notes are converted to equity  we would reclassify the unamortized deferred financing costs to equity 
we periodically monitor these fair values to determine if impairment write downs are required 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
two of our operating leases are commonly referred to as synthetic leases 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset to the lessee  and at least of the third party funds represent risk equity 
our synthetic leases are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes and financing leases for tax purposes 
while we recently entered into these synthetic leases  we will periodically review the fair values of the properties being leased or constructed in order to determine potential accounting ramifications 
changes in the equity participation of the third parties could affect the classification of this lease from operating to financing 
in that event  we would include both the cost and debt associated with the properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  under these leases we also provide a residual value guarantee which guarantees the lessor that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through an obligation to provide access to our technology is recognized ratably over the period of obligation 
deferred revenues related to these obligations are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the obligation 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred

expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   excluding the million charge for purchased in process research and development in we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of our protein  antibody and fusion product candidates 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred preclinical  clinical and manufacturing costs 
our preclinical costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to expanded activities  including toxicology studies  needed to support our investigational new drug filings that were made or will be made in the future  along with expanded activities in the area of antibody development  including increased outside collaboration costs and milestone payments 
our clinical costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from along with the cost of filing  initiating and sustaining new trials that began in we had seven drugs in eleven human clinical trials ongoing as of december  compared to four drugs in six human clinical trials ongoing as of december  our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased production activities within our process development and manufacturing facilities needed to support our increased clinical activities 
purchased in process research and development expense of million for the year ended december  relates to the acquisition of principia pharmaceutical corporation on september  this amount represents that portion of the million purchase price allocated to in process research and development 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from increased market research costs in connection with our expanding clinical activities and higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
patent expenses will continue to increase as additional applications are filed and existing applications are prosecuted in the united states and internationally 
interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to higher average cash and short term investment balances 
while we had higher average cash balances  the yield on our investments was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  due primarily to a full year of interest expense in relating to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes during the first quarter of fiscal partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with previously issued convertible subordinated notes that were converted to equity during the first quarter of fiscal charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in transgene  sa we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to an impairment that we deemed to be other than temporary 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
debt conversion expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the debt conversion expenses of million relate primarily to the second quarter of conversion of million aggregate principal of convertible subordinated notes due into equity 
the debt conversion expenses of million relate to the first quarter of conversion costs of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes into equity 
we converted results of operations continued years ended december  and continued million of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  substantially all of which was paid in the form of common stock 
in addition  we converted all of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  all of which was paid in cash 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion

expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   excluding the million charge for purchased in process research and development in we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred preclinical  clinical and manufacturing costs 
our preclinical costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to expanded activities  including toxicology studies  needed to support our investigational new drug filings that were made or will be made in the future  along with expanded activities in the area of antibody development  including increased outside collaboration costs 
our clinical costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of expanding our clinical trials in compared to the prior year 
we had four drugs in six human clinical trials ongoing as of december  compared to two drugs in four human clinical trials ongoing as of december  our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to a full year of operations for our process results of operations years ended december  and development and manufacturing facility in  compared to  when the facility commenced operations in the second quarter of purchased in process research and development expense of million for the year ended december  relates to the acquisition of principia pharmaceutical corporation on september  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
interest income was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances 
in addition  the yield on our investments was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance increased during as a result of the placement of two convertible subordinated note offerings during  totaling million and a public offering of common stock which raised net proceeds of million 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  due primarily to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes during the first quarter of fiscal we had debt conversion expenses of million for the year ended december  but no debt conversion expenses in other income of million for the year ended december  relates to the gain realized on the sale of  ordinary shares of our investment in cambridge antibody technology 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million for the year ended december  relates to our implementation of sab as a result of the implementation of sab  the company recorded a charge of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  retroactive to january  see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the difference in results for the years ended december  and is primarily due to the million  or per share  charge for purchased in process research and development  the million  or per share  of debt conversion expenses  the million  or per share  charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  higher operating expenses  and reduced collaboration partner revenues  offset by higher net interest income 
excluding the impact of the charge for purchased in process research and development  debt conversion expenses  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  our net loss would have been million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in working capital is due to our net loss and capital expenditures  along with an increase in our restricted investments  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
our restricted investments totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our restricted investments will increase to approximately million by assuming the full amount of million of lease financing is used for construction activities and our other collateral obligations remain in place 
we will be required to maintain this collateral in the form of restricted investments until  at which time all or a portion of the collateral may be used to satisfy our residual value guarantees under the leases or to exercise our options to acquire the related properties 
as a result  this increase in restricted investments will reduce our working capital 
liquidity and capital resources continued we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of an increasing number of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
at december   we had outstanding commitments for construction and equipment purchases totaling approximately million 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we are proceeding with numerous clinical trials  including one multi year repifermin trial involving over patients 
we have several phase i and phase ii trials underway and expect to initiate additional trials each year 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the completion periods for our phase i  phase ii and phase iii trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them and the number of clinical sites to be engaged in the trial 
we identify our potential drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
for example  in  we announced that the results from our ulcerative colitis trials showed that our drug candidate  repifermin was safe and well tolerated  but not shown to be effective 
we are continuing to analyze the results to determine how to proceed with this indication 
we are advancing many drug candidates  including therapeutic proteins  antibodies and fusion proteins  in part  to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including preclinical  clinical or manufacturing  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase 
we must receive fda approval to advance each of our products through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive fda regulatory approval to commercially launch any of our products 
in order to receive such approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs 
in addition  part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  glaxosmithkline gsk is conducting human clinical trials of an enzyme discovered by gsk as part of our collaboration with gsk  that lowers levels of lipoprotein associated phospholipase a lp pla  as a treatment for cardiovascular disease 
we have no control over the progress or completion of these trials 
while we received a million payment from gsk in connection with a development milestone met by gsk during  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the likelihood of receiving future milestone or royalty payments 
we also cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development efforts and therefore  our capital and liquidity requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds and interest income will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next several years 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs including our preclinical and clinical product development activities  the magnitude of those programs  the ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
liquidity and capital resources continued our future liquidity and capital resources will be affected by our contractual obligations 
these obligations are summarized below payments due by period dollars in thousands one year two to three four to five after five contractual obligations total or less years years years long term debt    capital lease obligation operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   long term collaboration obligations 
total contractual cash obligations 
     certain of our current or future lease payments are based upon currently applicable interest rates 
see additional discussion of these facility leases below 
certain of our operating leases contain residual value guarantees relating to two facility leases described below 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to commitments for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of laboratory space build out and equipment 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current collaborations will require us to make future milestone or royalty payments  we have excluded these amounts from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see notes i and j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we entered into two seven year lease agreements the october lease and the november lease relating to research  manufacturing  and administrative space either acquired or under construction by two trusts controlled by third parties established solely for that purpose 
as part of these agreements  we are required to maintain collateral  in the form of restricted investments  in amounts equal to of the financed project cost for the duration of the leases 
under these lease agreements  which we have accounted for as operating leases  we have the option to purchase the properties  during and at the end of the lease terms  at an aggregate amount of approximately million 
alternatively  we can cause the properties to be sold to third parties 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with each property in the event the net sale proceeds are less than the original financed costs of the facilities 
the residual value guarantee for the october lease and the november lease is approximately million and million  respectively  assuming the full amount of the financings is used for construction activities 
the october lease relates to a research and development complex adjacent to our current corporate campus 
we are leasing this property for seven years from a trust established solely for this purpose by allfirst bank 
the trust is leasing the property from the maryland economic development corporation medco  which is the owner of the property 
the cost of the existing property along with a building currently under construction is approximately million 
we are required to maintain collateral in the form of marketable securities equal to of the financed project cost with the lending institution for the duration of the lease 
the rent under this lease is currently based on a floating interest rate  but the trust can lock in a fixed interest rate at any time at our request 
to the extent the trust does not lock in a fixed interest rate  if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase 
if interest rates decrease  our rent obligations would decrease 
as of december   the trust had fixed the interest rate on million at approximately 
the remaining million is floating based primarily on the seven day libor rate  which was approximately  as of december  we have a residual value guarantee of of the total financed cost at lease termination 
in the event of our default  we are responsible for of the total financed cost of the project 
although the trust is responsible for servicing and repaying the debt and equity financings to various parties  we have made the residual value guarantee to the trust 
this trust was established solely for this one lease 
in the event the trust defaults to the lender liquidity and capital resources continued or in the event the trust is terminated  we have the right to cure the default or exercise our option to acquire the property 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to purchase legal and or beneficial interest in the project for of the lease balance plus any unpaid indemnity amounts 
the november lease relates to the construction of our research and development and administrative main campus and a large scale manufacturing facility 
we will lease these properties for approximately five years  following an estimated two year construction period  from a trust established solely for this purpose by bancboston leasing investment  inc and first union national bank 
the trust has entered into agreements with bancboston and first union to provide financing for construction of the properties in the aggregate amount of million 
we are required to maintain collateral in the form of marketable securities equal to of the financed project cost with the lending institutions for the duration of the lease 
the rent under these leases is currently based on a floating interest rate  but the trust can lock in a fixed interest rate at any time at our request 
to the extent the trust does not lock in a fixed interest rate  if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase 
if interest rates decrease  our rent obligations would decrease 
at december   the floating interest rate based primarily on short term commercial paper was approximately 
we have retained ownership of the land for the main campus component of this project 
we have entered into a ground lease with the trust for the land at fair market value rates 
thereafter  rent will be reduced to a nominal amount 
we will record these lease payments on our balance sheet as deferred rental income over the two year construction period and then amortize this deferral over the remaining term approximately five years 
we have a residual value guarantee of of the total financed cost at lease termination 
in the event of default  we are responsible for of the total financed cost of the project 
during the construction period  we have a residual value guarantee of of the financed cost incurred 
although the trust is responsible for servicing and repaying the debt and equity financings to various parties  we have made the residual value guarantee to the trust 
this trust was established solely for this one lease 
in the event the trust defaults to the lender or in the event the trust is terminated  we have the right to cure the default or exercise our option to acquire the property 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to purchase legal and or beneficial interest in the project for of the lease balance plus any unpaid indemnity amounts 
we understand that the accounting treatment for these leases may be changed by the financial accounting standards board in in that event  we may be required to include these leased facilities and the related lease obligations on our balance sheet as assets and liabilities 
our commitments  and their expiration dates are as follows amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments dollars in thousands total amounts one year or two to four to after five committed less three years five years years lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantee october lease   guarantee november lease   standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total commercial commitments   the guarantee of included above is based upon the loaned amount of million as of december  our guarantee will increase to approximately million when we reach the full million financed cost of the project at the end of the construction period 
the construction period guarantee of included above is based upon a financed cost incurred of approximately million as of december  our post construction guarantee will be of financed project costs and will increase to approximately million when we reach the full million financed cost of the project at the end of the construction period 
liquidity and capital resources continued as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  by the year we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our funds may be invested in us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital

we undertake no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this announcement whether as a result of new information  future events or circumstances or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio can be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt having a rating of at least an a rating and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately eighteen months  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of billion  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are almost always held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates would adversely affect the interest income from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
the facility leases we entered into during the fourth quarter of require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments as collateral for these facilities 
by  we expect our restricted investments for these leases to be approximately million 
we are also required to maintain approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in both a rising or declining interest rate environment 
the rent under certain of these facility leases is based on a floating interest rate 
we can direct medco or the trusts which own certain of the facilities and lease them to us to lock in a fixed interest rate 
as of december   such a fixed rate for seven years would be approximately compared to the floating rate as of december  of approximately 
if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase  which would adversely affect our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued as of december   the carrying values of our equity investments in transgene  cambridge antibody technology cat and ciphergen were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our investments in transgene and ciphergen are subject to equity market risk 
our investment in cat is denominated in pounds sterling and is subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment in transgene to million from million due to an impairment of the value of the investment that we deemed to be other than temporary
