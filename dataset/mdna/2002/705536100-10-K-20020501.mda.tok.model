highlights consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  an increase over the prior fiscal year 
the increase was attributable to increased licensing and asic chips revenues 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year of million  including million of block licenses  increased from the previous fiscal year 
fifteen block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year of which approximately million was recognized as revenue during the year 
the remaining million will be recognized over the following seven quarters  due to extended payment terms 
under the terms of the block licensing agreements entered into in fiscal year  no amounts were carried forward for revenue recognition in future fiscal years 
engineering services and maintenance contract backlog at january  approximated million  this compares to million as of january  during fiscal year  the company reorganized its core imaging operations to streamline engineering processes and strengthen the architectural part of the engineering organization to more efficiently deploy engineering staff across customer project and product development efforts 
these changes allow the company to maintain better focus on developing a new high performance color architecture 
additionally  the company expanded its strong relationship with adobe systems incorporated through the latest release of adobe r postscript r printing and imaging technologies which support the adobe portable document format pdf specification 
on january   the company announced the divestiture of its netreon storage management operations  effective january  peerless retained the networking technology obtained from the company s acquisition of netreon for continuing integration into peerless core document imaging products 
as a result of the divestiture  the company expects operating expenses to decrease by approximately in fiscal year from levels experienced during fiscal year because the effective date of the divestiture so closely approximates the company s year end  the consolidated results of operations include netreon s results for the entire year  which is reflected in the comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and in management s discussion and analysis 
there is no assurance that the company can or will be successful in the pursuit of these new opportunities that are expected to result in a growth in revenues 
failure to realize success in these opportunities could have a material adverse effect on the company s operational results 
general peerless  together with its subsidiary  psip  is a provider of software based imaging and networking systems to original equipment manufacturers of digital document products 
the peerless imaging solution is based on a combination of software and imaging asics  which together form a cost effective imaging system that addresses virtually all sectors of the printing market  from low end soho inkjets to high end laser digital color copiers and printers 
the low cost  high performance printers and mfps that incorporate the company s imaging solutions are increasingly replacing expensive standalone copiers and printers in corporate offices 
additionally  the company s embedded directory agent technology enables networked devices to use directory services 
these directory services can authenticate users and administer their access rights 
they also allow a device to list its configuration parameters in a central directory on the network  and to configure itself automatically without the need for user intervention 
the company generates revenue from its oems through the sale of imaging solutions in either turnkey or software development kit form 
historically  oem demand for turnkey solutions had exceeded demand for sdk solutions 
however  in the fiscal year  the company experienced a shift in demand away from turnkey solutions towards demand for the company s sdks  particularly for its mature monochrome solutions 
the company has attempted to expand its solution offerings by incorporating related imaging and networking technologies licensed from third parties 
the company s product licensing revenues are comprised of both recurring per unit and block licensing revenues and development licensing fees for source code or sdks 
licensing revenues are derived from per unit fees paid periodically by the company s oem customers upon manufacturing and subsequent commercial shipment of products incorporating the company s technology 
licensing revenues are also derived from arrangements in which the company enables third party technology  such as solutions from adobe or novell  to be used with its products 
block licenses are per unit licenses made in large volume quantities to an oem for products either in or about to enter into distribution into the marketplace 
payment schedules for block licenses are negotiable and payment terms are often dependent on the size of the block and other terms and conditions of the block license being acquired 
typically  payments are made in either one lump sum or over a period of four or more quarters 
revenue received for block licenses is recognized in accordance with sop  which requires that revenue be recognized after acceptance by the oem and if fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of fees is probable 
for block licenses that have a significant portion of the payments due within twelve months  revenue is recognized at the time the block license becomes effective 
the company also has engineering services revenues that are derived primarily from adapting the company s software and supporting electronics to specific oem requirements 
the company provides its engineering services to oems seeking a turnkey imaging solution for their digital document products 
the company s maintenance revenues are derived from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance revenues currently constitute a small portion of total revenue 
as part of the total solution offered to its oems  the company developed a direct distribution channel for its asic chips 
under this fabless model  peerless supplies asic chips from the foundry directly to the oems through third party distributors  which include arrow electronics and marubun corporation 
the company is responsible for marketing and sales administration  including the billings and collections to and from its oems and distributors  and the third party is responsible for the coordination of production with the foundry  maintenance of necessary inventories  and providing just in time delivery to oems and distributors 
historically  a limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
therefore  the availability and successful closing of new contracts  or modifications and additions to existing contracts with these customers may materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations from quarter to quarter 
the current market in which the company operates has been consolidating  and the demand for the technology and products offered by the company declined throughout fiscal year peerless technology addresses the worldwide market for printers ppm and mfp ppm 
unit volume for these types of printers is projected by idc to grow at lower rates than in years past 
available data indicate that retail prices are declining in these segments 
both of these segments are key target markets for the company 
there has been a decline in the number of contracts that the company has with oems under which the company is currently performing services and granting licenses  and this decline is likely to continue along with the demand for the technology and products the company presently offers 
competitors have merged into larger business units with the resulting strength to acquire and impose a competitive advantage in the company s market segments 
although sales have increased during fiscal year  the company is continuing to meet sales resistance from its customers 
in the past  these oems have reduced the absolute number of new products being developed and in some instances  the oems have preferred to perform in house development projects for the products that they are developing and or planning to launch 
although there have been fewer opportunities for the company to sell its turnkey services and sdks  the company continued to support its current oem controller customers in the digital printing devices business with its existing technology and has sized the organization to provide the necessary support and maintenance 
during the current fiscal year  the company has invested in research and development and has developed and integrated new product technologies that the company will offer to its oem customers in this and future quarters 
the company has addressed the deterioration in the demand for its solutions by sizing its organization to manage the current business requirements of imaging for digital document products and has adapted its pricing model to changing market conditions 
in addition  as a result of the decline in the embedded controller business  the company is exploring opportunities to enhance the value of the company  including new market opportunities  mergers  acquisitions and or the sale of all or a portion of company s assets 
there is no assurance that the company can or will be successful in the pursuit of these new opportunities that are expected to result in a growth in revenues 
failure to realize success in these opportunities could have a material adverse effect on the company s operational results 
critical accounting policies the company accounts for its software revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company over the past two years entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between the company and the oem selling product utilizing the company s intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which peerless is an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable and collection of the fees are probable 
under the company s accounting policies fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop if the company had negotiated all of its block license agreements such that agreements would have been recognized in the period in which the agreements had been entered into  revenues for fiscal year ended january  would have increased million or from that actually recognized and the company would not have million in licensing revenues to be recognized in fiscal years ending january  and the company recognizes revenues for certain of its engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for example  the impact on fiscal year engineering services revenues of a increase in the estimate of total hours to complete projects under contract would be to decrease engineering services revenues by million or and consolidated net income by million  or 
the impact of a decrease in the estimate of total hours to complete projects under contract would be to increase engineering services revenues by million or and consolidated net income by million or 
as of january   the company had net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future federal and state income of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire through fiscal years for federal and for state  respectively 
in addition  as of january   the company had tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million  which expire between fiscal years and the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for all of its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues years ended january  statements of operations data revenues product licensing engineering services and maintenance other total revenues cost of revenues product licensing engineering services and maintenance other total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other non recurring expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations other income loss on divestiture of storage operations interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years and the company narrowed its net loss for the twelve month period ended january  to million or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  a increase from fiscal year the increase was attributable to increased licensing and asics revenues which were partially offset by lower engineering services and maintenance revenues 
product licensing revenues for the year of million  including million of block license revenues  increased from fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  of which approximately million was recognized as revenue during the year  with the remaining million to be recognized over the following seven quarters 
during the fiscal year  the company had revenues of million in block licenses with adobe technology bundled with peerless intellectual property  compared with million in fiscal year prior to fiscal year  oems would license adobe technology directly from adobe 
adobe would pay peerless a portion of the revenues that adobe derived from its products that were licensed for use in peerless enabled products 
commencing in fiscal year  oems licensed and continue to license adobe technology from peerless  with peerless assuming additional responsibilities ie  certification  maintenance  collections  etc peerless pays adobe a portion of the revenues that peerless derives from adobe technology 
engineering services and maintenance fees generated by the company decreased approximately from fiscal year to fiscal year this was primarily the result of lower levels of turnkey bookings  an increase in the amount of work performed in house by oems  and product offerings by the company that did not match oems changing needs 
contract backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january  cost of revenues was million for fiscal year  a decrease from fiscal year product licensing costs increased to million  compared with million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to licensing costs of adobe technology bundled with peerless intellectual property associated with the adobe related block license revenues discussed above 
engineering services and maintenance costs represent a decrease from fiscal year  due to lower levels of revenues and improved performance 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin is attributable to approximately million in licensing agreements of peerless proprietary technology without any associated third party licensing costs 
the increase was also due largely to engineering services and maintenance margins  which improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  due to reduced costs for engineering services as previously discussed 
operating expenses for fiscal year were million  a decrease from fiscal year 
research and development expenses increased from fiscal year to fiscal year research and development expense increased as engineering efforts were directed at nas and san storage  magicprint tm  and the development of new imaging technologies 

sales and marketing expenses increased from fiscal year to fiscal year with activities directed at nas and san storage 
the company continues to focus on the penetration of new oem customers and other opportunities to promote the company s imaging and network solutions 

general and administrative expenses decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year insurance policy reimbursements for legal expenses  the reduction of compensation expense associated with management bonuses  and lower consulting and advisory fees were the primary factors for the decrease 
the company resolved a disputed claim regarding the licensing of its intellectual property and reported non recurring other income of million and collected a million receivable during fiscal year in addition  the company recorded a million loss in connection with the divestiture of the netreon storage management operations 
interest income earned in both fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
the decrease from fiscal year in interest income was due to a lower level of investments and lower interest rates 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal year the provision for taxes for the fiscal year was primarily attributable to foreign taxes paid 
the company has provided a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
comparison of fiscal years and net loss for the twelve month period ended january  was million or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year fiscal year revenues decreased from the previous year 
product licensing revenues for the year  which included million of block license revenues  decreased from the previous year 
block licenses result in bringing forward revenues to the current period if the fees are determined to be fixed and determinable and collection of the fees is probable 
the decrease in revenues would have been larger had it not been for the change in the company s licensing arrangement with adobe  whereby oems currently license adobe technology from peerless  with peerless paying adobe a portion of the revenues that peerless derives from adobe technology 
the change in the adobe arrangement has resulted in higher revenues and higher cost of revenues 
during fiscal year  the company made approximately million in block licenses with adobe technology bundled with peerless intellectual property 
this compares with block licenses in fiscal year of million 
as noted below  these block licenses also resulted in an increase in cost of revenues 
the decrease in revenues also resulted from the lower level of engineering services associated with turnkey efforts performed during the last months 
this was primarily the result of lower levels of turnkey bookings  a higher proportion as a percentage of total sales of sdk design wins during the prior fiscal year  an increase in the amount of work performed in house by oems  and product offerings by the company that did not match oems changing needs 
engineering services and maintenance fees generated by the company decreased approximately during fiscal year furthermore  revenues are negatively impacted  as the company does not receive royalty revenue in respect of sdk placements until after oems complete their development effort from the sdk and market their products 
cost of revenues was million for fiscal year  representing an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to licensing costs of million for fiscal year associated with the approximately million in licensing to oems of block licenses of third party technology bundled with peerless intellectual property 
during fiscal year  block licensing costs were million on million of adobe technology sales 
a decrease of from the prior fiscal year in the cost of engineering services  maintenance and other primarily due to staff reductions during fiscal year  partially offset the increase in cost of revenues 
although costs were down for engineering services  the company experienced losses on its engineering efforts as a result of cost overruns due to unanticipated complexities in the integration of new technologies into oem products 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease was due  in part  to higher licensing fees as a percentage of total revenue associated with the block sale of third party licenses 
engineering services and maintenance margins decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decline was attributable to additional costs associated with the completion of product deliveries for customers on fixed fee arrangements  complexities in the integration of new technologies into oem products  and severance costs 
peerless continues to invest heavily in the future by funding the research and development of new technology solutions 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal year due primarily to increased spending on technical solutions and continued investments in new storage technologies and imaging development programs 
although sales and marketing expenses decreased between fiscal years and due to staffing reductions  the company is still focused on the penetration of new oem customers  attendance at industry trade shows  and other opportunities to promote the company s imaging and network solutions 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased from fiscal year the resulting increase was due to increased legal costs associated with litigation  start up expenses associated with professional advisory firms  the use of outside strategy consultants relating to the company s exploration of strategic opportunities  and non recurring expenses arising out of severance agreements during the year 
interest income of  and  earned in fiscal years and  respectively  was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances resulting primarily from proceeds received from operations that have been retained in the business 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal is compared to in the prior year 
the provision for taxes for the fiscal year was primarily attributable to foreign taxes paid and an increase in the valuation allowance  net of the benefit to the company that will be realized from the loss carry back 
the company has provided a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents and investments  which  as of january  were million in the aggregate 
for the twelve month period ended january   the company incurred a loss and experienced substantial negative cash flow 
compared to january   total assets at january  decreased to million and stockholders equity decreased to million 
the company s cash and short term investment portfolio was million at january   a decrease of from january  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
the company used million in cash during the twelve month period ended january  to finance operations as compared to million in cash used for operations during the twelve month period ended january  the company s investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  resulted in a net source of cash of million 
it is the company s policy to invest the majority of its unused cash in low risk government and commercial debt securities 
the company has not historically purchased derivative instruments or entered into hedging transactions 
for the twelve month period ended january   the company invested approximately million in property  equipment and leasehold improvements compared to million during the previous twelve month period 
during fiscal year  million was provided by the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
during the fiscal year  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million pursuant to a settlement agreement with one of the former owners of psip 
those purchases occurred at the former owner s option  which option expired on october  net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
during the twelve month period ended january   cash and investments decreased by million compared to a million decrease in the prior fiscal year 
to offset the company s decrease in cash  the company has made a determined effort to collect its accounts receivable 
as a result  the company had a million reduction in current net trade receivables 
additionally  the company resolved a disputed claim regarding the licensing of intellectual property and as a result collected a million long term receivable during the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  million of cash was consumed by the operations of netreon and the divestiture of netreon s storage operations 
the divestiture resulted in cash payments of million  which  among other things  included a million payment made to a landlord to terminate the company s obligations under one of netreon s leases 
this termination also resulted in the release of million of previously restricted cash 
the company does not have a credit facility and the company does not expect to secure a line of credit 
if the company does not generate anticipated cash flow from sales  or if expenditures are greater than expected  the company most likely will reduce discretionary spending  which would require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its development efforts  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and prospects 
further  if the company continues to experience negative cash flows  as is anticipated  and is unable to increase revenues or cut costs so that revenues generated from operating activities are sufficient to meet the company s obligations as a result of which the company exhausts current capital resources  the company will be required to obtain additional capital from other sources 
such sources might include issuance of debt or equity securities  bank financing or other means that might be available to the company to increase its working capital 
under such circumstances  there is substantial doubt as to whether the company would be able to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to obtain such resources on commercially acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company  its operations  liquidity and financial condition  its prospects and the scope of strategic alternatives and initiatives available to the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks in its investments  mainly a lowering of interest rates 
the primary objectives of the company s investment activities are to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company from time to time maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
although the company is subject to interest rate risks  the company believes an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on its results from operations 
the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of the company s contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has experienced no foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and to a lesser extent foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
risks and uncertainties an investment in the company s common stock involves a high degree of risk 
peerless operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces  and other risks and uncertainties  including those that the company does not consider material at the time of the filing of this annual report on form k  may impair the company s business or operations 
if events giving rise to any of the risks discussed below actually occur  the company s business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
peerless has a history of losses and anticipates continued losses 
peerless has been unprofitable since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which ended on january  peerless expects to continue to incur quarterly losses at least through the first half of fiscal year and perhaps beyond 
while the divestiture of the unprofitable storage operations of netreon is expected to improve the company s operating results  there is no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
continuing losses will deplete the company s capital resources  and the company does not expect projected decreases in expenses to offset the lack of revenues 
the factors noted below have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s future revenues and or results of operations 
the future demand for the company s current imaging products is uncertain 
peerless current technology and products in the imaging segment have been in the marketplace for an average of months as of january  this represents a increase from the average of months that the company s products had been in the marketplace as of january  the growth in the average age of current technology and products in the marketplace reflects the decline in demand for the company s technology and products 
while peerless continues to license its current technology and products to certain oems  and has introduced new technology and products during this current fiscal year  there can be no assurance that the oems will continue to need or utilize the current technology and products that the company offers 
peerless may be unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance 
peerless currently derives substantially all of its revenues from licensing and sale of the company s embedded imaging software and products 
peerless expects that revenue from embedded imaging products will continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues during fiscal year and beyond 
the company s future success also depends in part on the company s ability to address the rapidly changing needs of potential customers in the marketplace  to introduce high quality  cost effective products  product enhancements and services on a timely basis  and to keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
the company s failure to achieve its business plan to develop and to successfully introduce new products and product enhancements in the company s prime markets is likely to materially and adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
peerless relies on relationships with certain customers and any change in those relationships will harm the company s business 
during fiscal year  three customers each generated greater than of the company s revenues and collectively contributed of revenues 
block license revenues for the same time period totaled million  or  of revenues 
during fiscal year  two customers each generated greater than of the revenues  and collectively contributed of revenues 
there were million of block license revenues during fiscal year a limited number of oem customers continue to provide a substantial portion of peerless revenues 
there presently are only a small number of oem customers in the digital document product market to which the company can market its technology and services 
therefore  the company s ability to replace a lost customer or offset a significant decrease in the revenues from a particular customer is severely constrained 
a reduction in business from just one customer providing a significant portion of the company s revenues can have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
international political instability may increase the cost of doing business and disrupt the company s business 
increased international political instability  disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the september terrorist attacks  the conflict in afghanistan and the hostilities in the middle east  may hinder the company s ability to do business and may increase its costs 
the increased instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively impact the desire of the company s employees and customers to travel  adversely affect the ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates  or require the company to take extra security precautions for operations 
in addition  to the extent that air and other transportation is delayed or disrupted  the operations of peerless oems and suppliers may be disrupted  and if such political instability or hostilities continue or increase  the business results for the company could be harmed 
the company s revenue from engineering services is subject to significant fluctuations 
peerless has experienced a significant reduction in the financial performance of its engineering services that has been caused by many factors  including 
product development delays see peerless must adapt to technology trends and evolving industry standards or the company will not be competitive below  
third party delays  and 
loss of new engineering services contracts 
there can be no assurance that these and similar factors will not continue to impact future engineering services results adversely 
peerless licensing revenue is subject to significant fluctuations 
the company s recurring licensing revenue model has shifted from per unit royalties paid upon oem shipment of its product and guaranteed quarterly minimum royalties to a model that results in revenues associated with the sale of sdks and block licenses 
the reliance on block licenses has occurred due to aging oem products in the marketplace  oem demands in negotiating licensing agreements  reductions in the number of oem products shipping and a design win mix that changed from object code licensing arrangements to sdks 
revenues may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as the number and value of design wins vary  or if the signing of block licenses are delayed or the licensing opportunities are lost to competitors 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
peerless may be unable to accurately estimate the company s revenues from product licensing and as a result may be required to adjust the company s revenues in the future 
in addition to block licenses  peerless recurring product licensing revenues are dependent on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from oem customers non block license agreements 
these reports are provided on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  the company must estimate the entire recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter 
the company must also estimate all quarterly and annual revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event that the company is unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting quarterly or annual results  the company may be required to adjust recorded revenues in subsequent periods 
peerless must adapt to technology trends and evolving industry standards or the company will not be competitive 
the marketplace for peerless products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  frequent new product introductions  knowledgeable oems with financial strength and negotiating leverage greater than the company s own  and a high degree of competition 
peerless success has always depended on the achievement of new design wins followed by oem deployment of associated new digital document products with attendant license fees  and the regular and continued introduction of new and enhanced technology and services to the company s oems on a timely and cost effective basis 
the shortfall of the acceptance by oems of the company s technology has been further exacerbated by less than projected deliveries of digital document products by the company s oem customers to the marketplace due to the recent slow down in business and economic activity 
there can be no assurance that the product solutions and technology of the company s competitors or the oems themselves will not render the company s technology or the company s oems products technically or fiscally noncompetitive or obsolete 
if peerless or its oems fail to anticipate or respond adequately to the rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards and needs  or any significant delay in development or introduction of new and enhanced products and services  it could result in a loss of competitiveness and or revenues 
such actions would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the industry for imaging systems for digital document products involves intense competition and rapid technological changes and the company s business may suffer if its competitors develop superior technology 
the market for imaging systems for digital document products is highly competitive and characterized by continuous pressure to enhance performance  to introduce new features and to accelerate the release of new products 
peerless competes on the basis of technology expertise  product functionality  development time and price 
peerless technology and services primarily compete with solutions developed internally by oems 
virtually all of the company s oem customers have significant investments in their existing solutions and have the substantial resources necessary to enhance existing products and to develop future products 
these oems possess or may develop competing imaging systems technologies and may implement these systems into their products  thereby replacing the company s current or proposed technologies  eliminating a need for the company s services and products and limiting the company s future opportunities 
therefore  peerless is required to persuade these oems to outsource the development of their imaging systems to the company and to provide products and solutions to these oems that cost effectively compete with their internally developed products 
peerless also competes with software and engineering services provided in the digital document product marketplace by other systems suppliers to oems 
as the industry continues to develop  competition and pricing pressures will increase from oems  existing competitors and other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with similar or substitute solutions that may be less costly or provide better performance or functionality 
peerless anticipates increasing competition for the company s color products under development  particularly as new competitors develop and enter products in this marketplace 
some of the company s existing competitors  many of the company s potential competitors  and virtually all of the company s oem customers have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than peerless 
in the event that price competition increases  competitive pressures could require the company to reduce the amount of royalties received on new licenses and to reduce the cost of the company s engineering services in order to maintain existing business and generate additional product licensing revenues 
this could reduce profit margins and result in losses and a decrease in market share 
no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to compete favorably with the internal development capabilities of the company s current and prospective oem customers or with other third party digital imaging system suppliers  and the inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
if peerless is not in compliance with the company s licensing agreements  peerless may lose the company s rights to sublicense technology  the company s competitors are aggressively pursuing the sale of licensed third party technology 
peerless currently sublicenses third party technologies to the company s oem customers 
such sublicense agreements are non exclusive 
if peerless is determined not to be in compliance with the company s agreements with its licensors  peerless may forfeit the company s right to sublicense these technologies 
likewise  if such sublicense agreements were canceled  peerless would lose the company s right to sublicense these technologies 
additionally  the licensing of these technologies has become very competitive with competitors possessing substantially greater financial and technical resources and market penetration than peerless 
as competitors are pursuing aggressive strategies to obtain similar rights as held by peerless to sublicense these third party technologies  there is no assurance that peerless can remain competitive in the marketplace if one or more competitors are successful 
the company s reserves for accounts receivable may not be adequate 
the company s net accounts receivable declined to million as of january   down from million as of january   reflecting significant collections from several major customers  including the conversion of unbilled receivables to accounts receivable and the resolution of a disputed claim regarding the licensing of intellectual property resulting in a collection of a million long term receivable 
although peerless believes that the company s reserves for accounts receivable are adequate for fiscal year  there can be no assurance this is the case 
if the company s reserves for accounts receivable are inadequate  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s business may suffer if the company s third party distributors are unable to distribute the company s products and address customer needs effectively 
peerless has developed a fabless distribution model for the sale of asics 
peerless has no direct distribution experience and places reliance on third party distributors to maintain inventories to address oem needs  manage manufacturing logistics  and distribute the product in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance that these distribution agreements will be maintained or will prove adequate to meet the company s needs and contractual requirements 
peerless relies on certain third party providers for applications to develop the company s asics 
as a result  peerless is vulnerable to any problems experienced by these providers  which may delay product shipments to the company s customers 
currently  peerless relies on three independent parties  motorola  ibm microelectronics and nec microelectronics  each of which provides unique application specific integrated circuits incorporating the company s imaging technology for use by the company s oems 
these sole source providers are subject to materials shortages  excess demand  reduction in capacity and or other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to the company s customers thereby adversely affecting the company s customer relationships 
any such disruption could limit or delay production or shipment of the products incorporating the company s technology  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
peerless relies on relationships with adobe systems incorporated and novell inc and any change in those relationships will harm the company s business 
the company has licensing agreements with adobe systems incorporated and novell inc to bundle and sublicense their licensed products with the company s licensed software 
these relationships accounted for million in revenues and an associated million in cost of revenues during fiscal year should the agreement with either vendor be terminated or canceled  there is no assurance that the company could replace that source of revenue within a short period of time  if at all 
such an event would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
peerless may be unable to respond quickly to changes in demand 
most of the company s costs and expenses are related to costs of engineering services and maintenance  product development  other personnel costs  marketing programs and facilities 
the level of spending for such costs and expenses is based  in significant part  on the company s expectations of future revenues and anticipated oem commitments and thus cannot be adjusted quickly 
as in fiscal year  if such commitments do not materialize or are terminated or if revenues are below expectations  costs and expenses will continue to be incurred and the company s quarterly and annual operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
peerless is dependent on key personnel and on employee retention and recruiting for the company s future success 
peerless is largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of the company s senior management and other officers and key employees 
the company s future success will continue to depend in large part upon the company s ability to retain and attract highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for such personnel is intense 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s international activities may expose the company to risks associated with currency fluctuations 
peerless is substantially dependent on the company s international business activities 
the international market for products incorporating the company s technology is highly competitive  and peerless faces substantial competition in this market from technologies developed internally by the company s oems 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities also include 
disruptions by terrorists of normal channels of distribution  
disruptions by terrorists of normal communications lines  
major currency rate fluctuations  
changes in the economic condition of foreign countries  
the imposition of government controls  
tailoring of products to local requirements  
trade restrictions  
changes in tariffs and taxes  and 
the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
although all of the company s contracts are  and peerless expects that the company s future contracts will be  denominated in us dollars  there can be no assurance that the company s contracts with international oems in the future will be denominated in us dollars 
if any of the company s contracts are denominated in foreign currencies  peerless will be subject to major risks associated with currency fluctuations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
demand from pacific rim customers has continued to and may continue to decline 
during the past several years and continuing through fiscal year  the pacific rim economies have been financially depressed 
as a result  companies in the imaging industry have reported negative financial impacts attributable to a decrease in demand from pacific rim customers 
the company s pacific rim customers are comprised primarily of companies headquartered in japan 
these japanese oems sell products containing the company s technology primarily in the north american  european  and asian marketplaces 
these revenues have declined and there can be no assurance that revenues from japanese oems will not continue to decline in future quarters 
the company s stock price may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the company s common stock has experienced price volatility 
in the day period ending april   the closing price of the stock ranged from per share to per share  and  since the beginning of fiscal year  the stock has closed as low as per share 
such price volatility may occur in the future 
factors that could affect the trading price of the company s common stock include 
macroeconomic conditions  
actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly results of operations  
announcements of new products or significant technological innovations by the company or the company s competitors  
developments or disputes with respect to proprietary rights  
losses of major oem customers  
general trends in the industry  and 
overall market conditions  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market historically has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price of securities of many related high technology companies and which at times have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
peerless is subject to securities litigation which is expensive and results in a diversion of resources 
peerless could be subject to additional litigation due to the volatility of the company s stock price or for other reasons 
securities class action litigation has become increasingly common in recent years 
technology companies are frequently the subjects of such litigation 
securities class action litigation is particularly common following periods of market volatility and significant fluctuations in companies stock prices 
in fiscal year  peerless and two of the company s former officers were named in two separate shareholder class action lawsuits 
the first was filed on august   the second was filed on september  on april   the company was served with an amended and consolidated complaint 
these lawsuits allege a scheme to artificially inflate the company s stock price based on alleged misleading public announcements and seek compensatory damages with interest and attorneys fees and expenses 
peerless believes all of the claims to be without merit 
a hearing on the motion filed by the company and the two former officers to dismiss the amended and consolidated complaint was held on october  by an order dated january   the court dismissed the first amended and consolidated complaint without prejudice and granted the plaintiffs sixty days to file a second amended and consolidated complaint 
the plaintiff class filed a second amended and consolidated complaint on march  litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect business  financial conditions and results of operations 
future sales of the company s common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock 
as of april   peerless had  shares of common stock outstanding  which does not include  shares subject to options outstanding as of such date under stock option plans that are exercisable at prices ranging from to per share 
management cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
certain holders of the company s common stock have registration rights with respect to their shares 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options  or the perception that such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for common stock 
the company s common stock may be removed from listing on the nasdaq national market and thus may not provide adequate liquidity 
nasdaq marketplace rule a requires companies listed on the nasdaq national market to maintain a minimum bid price of over a trading day period 
if peerless is unable to maintain compliance with these rules  the company s common stock may become subject to being removed from listing on the nasdaq national market 
trading in the company s common stock after a delisting  if any  would likely be conducted in the over the counter markets in the so called pink sheets or the national association of securities dealers electronic bulletin board and could also be subject to additional restrictions 
as a consequence of a delisting  the company s stockholders would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of  the company s common stock 
in addition  a delisting would make the company s common stock substantially less attractive as collateral for margin and purpose loans  for investment by financial institutions under their internal policies or state legal investment laws or as consideration in future capital raising transactions 
the company s common stock may be subject to the penny stock regulations which may affect the ability of the holders to sell the company s common stock 
if the company s common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  it may become subject to regulation as a penny stock 
the securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations that generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price or exercise price less than per share  subject to certain exceptions  including listing on the nasdaq national market 
if the common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market and no other exception applies  the company s common stock may become subject to the securities and exchange commission s penny stock rules  rule g through rule g under the securities exchange act of for transactions covered by these rules  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase 
additionally  a risk disclosure document mandated by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market must be delivered to the purchaser prior to the transaction  unless the transaction satisfies one of the exemptions under the rules 
the broker dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative  current quotations for the securities and  if the broker dealer is the sole market maker  the broker dealer must disclose this fact and the broker dealer s presumed control over the market 
monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock 
additionally  the rules may restrict the ability of broker dealers to sell the company s common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell the company s common stock in the secondary market 
the company s future investment income may fall below expectations due to adverse market conditions 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
peerless invests the company s excess cash in fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and high quality corporate issuers as well as floating rate money market funds 
interest rates on these instruments have declined substantially 
peerless  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or peerless may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities before maturity  if they have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
effects of anti takeover provisions could discourage  delay or prevent the company s acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
some of the provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could  together or separately 
discourage potential acquisition proposals  
delay or prevent a change in control  
limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
furthermore  certain of the company s agreements with strategic partners and customers require that peerless give prior notice of a change of control or may terminate if the company undergoes a change of control  without obtaining the prior written consent of such strategic partners and customers 
the company s existing capital resources may not be sufficient and if peerless is unable to raise additional capital  the company s business may suffer 
the company s cash and short term investment portfolio was million at january  and the current ratio of assets to current liabilities was for the twelve month period ended january   peerless used million in cash to finance operations 
the company s principal source of liquidity is the company s cash and cash equivalents and investments  which  as of january  were million in the aggregate 
for the twelve month period ended january   peerless incurred a loss and experienced negative cash flow from operating activities 
peerless does not have a credit facility and peerless does not expect to secure a line of credit 
if peerless does not generate anticipated cash flow from licensing  or if expenditures are greater than expected  peerless most likely will reduce discretionary spending  which could require a delay  scaling back or elimination of some or all of the company s development efforts  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  if peerless continues to experience negative cash flows  as is currently forecasted  and peerless is unable to increase revenues or cut costs so that revenues generated from operating activities are sufficient to meet the company s obligations as a result of which peerless exhausts current capital resources  peerless will be required to obtain additional capital from other sources 
such sources might include issuances of debt or equity securities  bank financing or other means that might be available to increase the company s working capital 
under such circumstances  there is substantial doubt as to whether peerless would be able to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to obtain such resources on commercially acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity and financial condition  the company s prospects and the scope of strategic alternatives and initiatives available to the company 
if peerless fails to adequately protect the company s intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  peerless could lose the company s intellectual property rights or be liable for damages 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon the company s proprietary technology 
to protect the company s proprietary rights  peerless relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws as well as the early implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of the company s confidentiality procedures  peerless policies are to enter into written nondisclosure agreements with the company s employees  consultants  prospective customers  oems and strategic partners and to take affirmative steps to limit access to and distribution of the company s software  intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  peerless may be unable to effectively protect the company s proprietary rights and the enforcement of the company s proprietary rights may be cost prohibitive 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use the company s products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
peerless cannot be certain that the steps its takes to prevent unauthorized use of its technology  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states  will be effective 
the company s source code also is protected as a trade secret 
however  from time to time peerless licenses the company s source code to oems  which subjects the company to the risk of unauthorized use or misappropriation despite the contractual terms restricting disclosure and use 
in addition  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy the company s products or to reverse engineer in order to obtain and subsequently use the company s proprietary information 
the company holds nine patents issued in the united states  one of which is also issued in france  germany  great britain  japan and hong kong 
the issued patents relate to techniques developed by the company for generating output for continuous synchronous raster output devices  such as laser printers  compressing data for use with output devices  filtering techniques for use with output devices and communicating with peripheral devices over a network 
the company also has five patent applications and two provisional applications pending in the united states  four applications pending in the european patent office  four applications pending in japan  two applications pending in hong kong  one application pending in canada and one application pending in the republic of china

the company also has five patent applications and two provisional applications pending in the united states  four applications pending in the european patent office  four applications pending in japan  two applications pending in hong kong  one application pending in canada and one application pending in the republic of china 
there can be no assurance that patents peerless holds will not be challenged or invalidated  that patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or issue in the countries where products incorporating the company s technology may be sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
in any event  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries 
the status of united states patent protection in the software industry will evolve as the united states patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
patents have been granted to fundamental technologies in software after the development of an industry around such technologies and patents may be issued to third parties that relate to fundamental technologies related to the company s technology 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the company s industry increases  products based on the company s technologies may become the subjects of infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
any such claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  peerless may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not such litigation is determined in the company s favor  could result in significant expenses and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in addition  peerless may lack sufficient resources to initiate a meritorious claim 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any litigation regarding intellectual property  peerless may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  and expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing or substituted technology 
the company s failure to develop  or license on acceptable terms  a substitute technology if required could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
peerless may be unable to manage expansion and growth effectively 
the company s ability to implement the company s business plan  develop and offer products and manage expansion in rapidly developing and disparate marketplaces requires comprehensive and effective planning and management 
the growth in the complexity of business relationships with current and potential customers and third parties has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on management systems and resources 
the company s failure to continue to improve upon the operational  managerial and financial controls  reporting systems and procedures in its imaging business or the company s failure to expand and manage its workforce could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
peerless may be unable to deploy the company s employees effectively in connection with changing demands from the company s oem customers 
the industry in which peerless operates has experienced significant downturns  both in the united states and abroad  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
over the past two years  peerless has experienced a shift in oem demand from the historically prevailing requirement for turnkey solutions toward sdks 
because peerless has experienced a general decrease in demand for engineering services  engineering services resources have been re deployed to research and development 
should this trend abruptly change  peerless may be unable to re deploy labor effectively and in a timely manner  which inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s operational results
