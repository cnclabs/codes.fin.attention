item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 

table of contents strength of infrastructure the company s continued success and profitability partly depends on its ability to continue to improve its infrastructure particularly personnel and information systems in order to increase operational efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to make sufficient improvements to maintain its competitive advantage 
patent rights the company s continued business success may be largely dependent on its ability to obtain licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain desirable technology licenses  the company could be prohibited from marketing products  could be forced to market products without desirable features or could incur substantial costs to redesign its products  defend legal actions or pay damages 
environmental laws and regulation certain of the company s operations are subject to regulation pursuant to various federal  state and international laws governing the environment 
the company s compliance with such laws has not had a material effect upon the company s financial position or operations 
the company does not anticipate that such laws will have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
however  no assurance can be given that such laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
equity investments the company has made  and continues to evaluate and make  strategic equity investments in privately held technology companies 
because these companies are typically early stage ventures with either unproven business models  products that are not yet fully developed or products that have not yet achieved market acceptance  these investments are inherently risky 
many factors outside the company s control determine whether or not the company s investments will be successful 
such factors include the ability of a company to obtain additional private equity financing  to access the public capital markets  to effect a sale or merger  or to achieve commercial success with its products or services 
the company currently anticipates that it will make minimal additional investments in fiscal and will focus on managing its current investments 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the company s existing investments or any new investments will be successful or that the company will be able to recover its net basis in the investments
