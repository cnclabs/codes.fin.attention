critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and other long lived assets as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  product liability  customer discounts  taxation  restructuring  post retirement and pension benefits and environmental matters 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial techniques 
the company re evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from those determined using the estimates described above 
sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers  net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade  co op advertising and other sales discounts are recognized as revenue upon shipment to customers and when all substantial risks of ownership change 
recent accounting pronouncements at the beginning of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income 
the impact of adopting fas no 
on january  resulted in a cumulative after tax gain of approximately million  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative effect of adopting fas no 
did not materially impact the results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards boards fasb issued fas no 
 business combinations  and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
historically  all acquisitions by the company have been accounted for as purchases  thus there was no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard  in contrast  all mergers have been accounted for as poolings of interest 
fas no 
becomes effective in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company plans to early adopt the provisions of fas no 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with this standard  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december  the company anticipates that the application of the nonamortization provisions will increase annual net income by approximately million or per share 
during and the first quarter  the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  subject to final analysis  the company expects to record a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million to million in the first quarter of in august  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
this statement established a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
the statement supersedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and amends the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fas no 
on january   and the standard did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in august  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer or a reseller of vendor s product which codified and reconciled the task force s consensuses in eitf accounting for certain sales incentives  eitf accounting for points and certain other time based sales incentives or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers of free products or services to be delivered in the future  and eitf vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
these eitf s prescribe guidance regarding the timing of recognition and income statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales incentive programs to resellers and end consumers 
eitf no 
did not impact results of operations because the company recognizes sales incentives upon recognition of revenue and classifies them as reductions of gross revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of goods sold when shipped  both in accordance with the prescribed rules 
in may  the eitf issued eitf no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
eitf no 
requires that amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling be classified as a cost of products sold 
historically  these revenues and costs had been netted together and deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales 
the net sales and cost of products sold have been restated for this change 
the impact of this change increased net sales and cost of products sold by million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
there was no impact on gross income resulting from this change 
legal and environmental matters the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including various environmental matters  in the ordinary course of its business 
such legal proceedings are more fully described in footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although management of the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty  it believes that the ultimate resolution of the company s legal proceedings  including any amounts it may have to pay in excess of amounts reserved  will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
international operations the company s non us business is growing at a faster pace than its business in the united states 
this growth outside the us has been fueled by recent international acquisitions  primarily in europe 
for the years ended december   december  and december   the company s non us business accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
growth of both us and us businesses is shown below year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us   year ended december  change in millions net sales us   non us   market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate exposure was reduced significantly in from the issuance of million company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust  the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivative instruments are recorded on the company s balance sheet at fair value  and any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income 
due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity 
the company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition  but are shown as an illustration of the impact of adverse changes in interest rates 
time confidence amount period level in millions interest rates day foreign exchange day the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets 
euro currency conversion on january   the euro became the common legal currency for of the member countries of the european union 
on that date  the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies legacy currencies and the euro 
on january   the euro began trading on currency exchanges and became available for noncash transactions  if the parties elected to use it 
on january   another country greece also adopted the euro  fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency 
the legacy currencies remained legal tender through december  on january   participating countries introduced euro denominated bills and coins  and effective july   legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
after the dual currency phase  all businesses in participating countries must conduct all transactions in the euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be euro based 
the company has substantially completed this conversion process and has deemed its information systems to be euro compliant 
as a result of the euro conversion  the company experienced no adverse impact to its business or financial condition on a consolidated basis
