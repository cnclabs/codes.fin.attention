item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview weider nutrition international  inc develops  manufactures  markets  distributes and sells branded and private label vitamins  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition products in the united states and throughout the world 
operating results for fiscal and were affected by an industry slow down  including lack of successful new product introductions  increased competitive pressures  particularly from increasing private label  reorganization of the company into three business units and the impact of certain unusual items 
operating results for fiscal were affected by several strategic initiatives including  among others  organizational changes including senior management changes  upgrading management systems and the continued implementation of an enhanced marketing plan 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to reorganize into three business units the schiff specialty unit  the active nutrition unit and the haleko unit 
the schiff specialty unit contains the schiff and schiff move free brands  as well as private label business limited to customers that otherwise carry our products 
the active nutrition unit includes weider branded global businesses and our tiger s milk brand 
the haleko unit  our primary european subsidiary  includes the multipower and multaben nutritional supplement brands  the venice beach sports apparel brand  and private label businesses 
the reorganization resulted in an approximate million charge during the fiscal second quarter  primarily associated with employee severance costs 
we adopted eitf no 
effective march   and reclassified prior period amounts as required by the new accounting standard 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not materially impact overall results of operations 
however  the cost of certain sales incentives or promotional considerations previously recognized as operating expenses were reclassified as reductions in net sales and or increases in cost of goods sold 
as a result of our adoption of eitf no 
 gross profit for fiscal  and  respectively  decreased by approximately million  million and million  and selling and marketing expenses decreased by the same amounts for the respective periods 
on july   we announced the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain associated liabilities relating to our american body building and science foods brands 
the sales price included approximately million in cash and the assumption of an approximate  mortgage on the accompanying beverage facility 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million during the fiscal fourth quarter  primarily associated with the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets 
factors affecting fiscal and results  the previous implementation of strategic initiatives and continuing refinement of our growth and business strategies are ongoing considerations and processes 
while the focus of these considerations are to improve future profitability  no assurance can be given that our decisions relating to these initiatives will not adversely effect the financial condition and results of operations of weider nutrition international  inc the following table shows selected items as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended may dollars in thousands net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    operating expenses    litigation settlement

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal net sales decreased in fiscal primarily due to an industry slowdown  lower than expected new product sales  an increase in negative publicity towards certain nutritional supplements and the growth of private label 
the following table shows comparative net sales results categorized by business unit as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended may dollars in thousands schiff specialty   active nutrition   haleko   inter divisional  
 
total   schiff specialty sales decreased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net sales decreased primarily due to a decline in schiff move free revenue  partially offset by increased private label sales 
net sales of schiff move free products were million and million  respectively  for fiscal and private label sales volume was million and million  respectively  for fiscal and we believe schiff move free net sales may continue to decline in fiscal primarily as a result of increasing private label competitive pressures 
active nutrition net sales decreased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net sales decreased primarily due to increased competitive pressures in the sports nutrition category  elimination of approximately million in powders private label sales volume  and our decision to discontinue business in certain unprofitable accounts 
haleko net sales decreased to in fiscal  from million in fiscal net sales decreased primarily due to a decline in venice beach sportswear sales  consistent with our desire to eliminate unprofitable accounts and skus and refocus the sportswear business in health clubs and gyms 
venice beach net sales were million and million  respectively  for fiscal and our two largest customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of net sales for fiscal and we believe that these two customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales 
see item factors affecting future performance dependence on significant customers 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from a change in product sales mix  including an increase in private label  and an increase in certain sales incentive costs  which are now recognized as a direct reduction of sales under eitf no 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal these operating expense amounts include litigation settlement income of 
million and million  respectively  for fiscal and  and an asset impairment loss of million for fiscal excluding these unusual items  operating expenses decreased approximately to million for fiscal and  as a percentage of net sales  were and  respectively  for fiscal and operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased primarily due to cost cutting initiatives including two reductions in force and a reduction in selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses  including sales  marketing  advertising  freight and other costs  decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal selling and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to reduced domestic national advertising and consumer marketing costs  reclassification of sales incentives under eitf no 
and reduced expenses associated with our schiff move free brand 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased primarily from reductions in outside professional and legal related costs and reduced depreciation expense 
other expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal in may  we restructured our domestic credit facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we paid off million in subordinated loan debt and accelerated amortization of outstanding senior term loans 
these modifications to our domestic credit facilites resulted in an approximate million write off in fiscal of previously capitalized financing fees  including original issue discount costs 
during fiscal  we believed that an other than temporary decline in valuation of certain equity securities had occurred and  accordingly  recognized a securities impairment loss of approximately million 
excluding these unusual charges  other expense  net  decreased approximately million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an overall lower effective borrowing rate on reduced aggregate indebtedness 
aggregate debt net of remaining original issue discount costs declined approximately million to million at may   from approximately million at may  income taxes 
provision for income taxes was an approximate 
million benefit for both fiscal and the benefit  as a percentage of income loss before income taxes  was approximately in fiscal  compared to approximately in fiscal during fiscal  income tax benefits were not recognized on international pre tax losses  primarily associated with our haleko subsidiary 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal net sales decreased in fiscal  primarily due to an industry slowdown  lower than expected new product sales and heightened private label and other competitive pressures 
the following table shows comparative net sales results categorized by business unit as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended may dollars in thousands schiff specialty   active nutrition   haleko   inter divisional  
 
total   schiff specialty net sales decreased approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal net sales decreased primarily due to reduced net sales of our schiff move free brand 
net sales of schiff move free products were million and million  respectively  for fiscal and schiff move free sales decreased primarily from industry slowdown and promotional timing considerations as well as heightened competition  including private label 
active nutrition net sales decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal net sales decreased primarily from reduced branded and private label sales volume with a large retail customer 
haleko net sales increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal sales volume increased primarily due to sportswear sales growth in our european operations 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from operating efficiencies  improved net raw material costing and reduced credits for returned products  somewhat offset by a significant decrease in margin on european sportswear sales and lower margins on private label sales 
the lower margin on sportswear sales is primarily attributable to continued growth in department stores where pricing is much more competitive than the typical health clubs and gyms 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  including litigation settlement income of million in fiscal  decreased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal excluding this unusual item  operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were and  respectively  for fiscal and the increase was primarily due to an approximate two percentage point increase in selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to incremental marketing and promotional costs to support retail sell through and brand building initiatives and to counter private label and other competitive pressures 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million fiscal general and administrative expenses increased primarily from amounts spent on information systems and personnel related costs associated with our haleko business unit 
other expense 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal other expense increased primarily due to the recognition of a securities impairment loss of approximately million recognized because we believed that an other than temporary decline in valuation of available for sale equity securities had occurred 
the overall increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in interest costs associated with an overall reduction in indebtedness 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes was a tax benefit of million for fiscal  compared to a tax expense of million for fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit in fiscal due to the pre tax loss 
the significant income tax benefit for fiscal  as a percentage of the pre tax loss  was primarily due to income tax rate differences for our domestic and international operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased million to approximately million at may   from million at may  working capital decreased primarily due to a decrease in inventories  partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable 
inventories decreased approximately million primarily as a result of continuing improvements in inventory management  the timing of shipments to customers  write down of haleko sports apparel and other products and lower net sales 
we entered into a million senior credit facility the credit facility with bankers trust company  effective june   on behalf of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility was originally comprised of a million amortizing term loan and a million revolving loan 
effective may   we amended the credit facility whereby the outstanding balance of the term loan was reduced to million and the aggregate revolving loan availability was reduced to million 
under the revolving loan  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii the lesser of million or of the eligible inventory 
the credit facility contains customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants regarding minimum cash flows and limitations on indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on all owned or acquired tangible and intangible assets associated with our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility is being used to fund our normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
at may   the outstanding balance of the revolving loan was million  and available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
our domestic operations are also supported by a million subordinated loan the subordinated loan obtained in conjunction with the credit facility 
effective may   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay down million of the subordinated loan 
the subordinated loan contains customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants regarding minimum cash flows and limitations on indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
our european working capital needs primarily haleko are supported by a germany based secured credit facility the haleko facility that renews annually  in june 
our obligations under the haleko facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all haleko tangible and intangible assets 
during june  we renewed the haleko facility with deutsche bank ag in the approximate amount of million 
at may   the outstanding balance of the haleko facility was million included in current portion of long term debt and available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and the financing sources discussed above will be sufficient to meet our normal operation requirements during the next twelve months 
however  we continue to review opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  product rights and other investments that are compatible with our existing business 
we could use cash and financing sources discussed herein  or financing sources that subsequently become available  to fund additional acquisitions or investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth  or to refinance existing debt 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
in february  we announced the suspension of the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
we are using the available cash from the dividend suspension  approximately million quarterly  for debt reduction  sales and marketing initiatives  research and development  and other general corporate purposes 
we paid an annual dividend of per share quarterly dividend of per share for fiscal and our board of directors will determine dividend policy in the future based upon  among other factors  results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant at the time 
in addition  our credit facilities contain certain customary financial covenants that may limit our ability to pay common stock dividends 
we can give no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
a summary of our outstanding long term debt and operating lease contractual obligations at may  is as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years after years long term debt     operating leases      total obligations      critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to valuation of inventories  allowance for doubtful accounts  notes and sales returns  valuation of deferred tax assets and recoverability of long lived assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto our customers through price increases and we anticipate that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
seasonality our business can be seasonal  with fluctuations in sales resulting from timing of marketing and promotional activities  customer buying patterns and consumer spending patterns 
our fiscal quarterly net sales ranged from a low of million for the third quarter to a high of million for the first quarter 
in addition  as a result of changes in product sales mix and other factors  as discussed above  we experience fluctuations in gross profit and operating margins on a quarter to quarter basis 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires companies to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment rather than amortize them 
we expect to recognize a significant pre tax impairment loss during our first quarter of fiscal at may   the net book value of our intangible assets was million  including million in goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense was   and  respectively  for fiscal  and in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
removes goodwill from its scope and retains the requirements of sfas no 
regarding the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets held for use 
sfas no 
also supercedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for our financial statements as of june  we have not determined the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash flows and net earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we are not currently party to any significant derivative instruments and our current investment policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposure 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
we measure market risk  related to our holdings of financial instruments  based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change in interest rates would have a material effect on pretax earnings or cash flows
