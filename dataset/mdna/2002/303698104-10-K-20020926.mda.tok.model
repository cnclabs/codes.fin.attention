critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
in response to release no 
 we reviewed our accounting policies 
the following areas require the use of judgments and estimates the valuation of long lived assets  pension and postretirement benefits  deferred income taxes  environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets 
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans covering most of our employees 
employees in our foreign subsidiaries may participate in local pension plans  for which our liability is in the aggregate insignificant 
our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the employee retirement income security act of or local statutory law 
the accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of at june  and at june  the effect of such change resulted in an increase to the accumulated benefit obligation in assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
for measurement purposes  we assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita claims cost of covered health care benefits for the rate was assumed to decrease to in and remain at that level thereafter 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
to date  such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or net cash flows  although we have expended  and can be expected to expend in the future  significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities  remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters  particularly in our aerospace fasteners segment 
in connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate  we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition 
in addition  we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned  or previously owned  by us  that may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean up 
we are also a defendant in certain lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters  and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites 
we believe that we have recorded adequate reserves in our financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions 
no amounts have been recorded as due from third parties  including insurers  or set off against  any environmental liability  unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability 
legal matters we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business 
we  either on our own or through our insurance carriers  are contesting these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future results of operations  or net cash flows 
revenue recognition sales and related costs are recognized upon shipment of products and or performance of services  when collection is probable 
sales and related cost of sales on long term contracts are recognized as products are delivered and services performed  as determined by the percentage of completion method 
lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues 
results of operations business transactions the following summarizes certain business combinations and transactions we completed which significantly affect the comparability of the period to period results presented in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
fiscal transactions on july   we sold our interest in nacanco paketleme to american national can group  inc for approximately million 
our investment in nacanco began in november  and throughout the years we invested approximately million in nacanco 
since the inception of our investment  we recorded equity earnings of million and received cash dividends of million from nacanco 
we recognized a million nonrecurring gain from this divestiture in the nine months ended april  we also agreed to provide consulting services over a three year period  at an annual fee of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from the disposition to reduce our indebtedness 
as a result of this disposition  our interest expense was reduced 
however  our equity earnings and dividend proceeds also significantly decreased 
in accordance with our plan to dispose of non core assets  the opportunity to dispose of our interest in nacanco paketleme presented us with an excellent opportunity to realize a substantial return on our investment and allowed us to reduce our then outstanding indebtedness by approximately 
on september   we completed the disposal of our camloc gas springs division to a subsidiary of arvin industries inc for approximately million 
in addition  we received million from arvin industries for a covenant not to compete 
we recognized a million nonrecurring pre tax gain from this disposition 
we decided to dispose of the camloc gas springs division in order to concentrate our focus on our operations in the aerospace industry 
on december   we disposed of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our dallas aerospace subsidiary to united technologies inc for approximately million 
no gain or loss was recognized from this transaction  as the proceeds received approximated the net carrying value of these assets 
approximately million of the proceeds from this disposition were used to reduce our bank term indebtedness and our interest expense 
as a result of this transaction  we reported a reduction in revenues of million and operating income of million for the nine months ended april   as compared to the nine months ended april  we estimated that the market base for the older type of engines that we were selling was shrinking  and that we would be required to invest a substantial amount of cash to purchase newer type of engines to maintain market share 
the opportunity to exit this business presented us with an opportunity to improve cash flows by reducing our indebtedness by million  and by preserving our cash  which would otherwise have had to have been invested to upgrade our inventory 
on april   we completed a spin off to our stockholders of the shares of fairchild bermuda ltd 
on april   fairchild bermuda sold to convac technologies ltd 
the optical disc equipment group business formerly owned by fairchild technologies 
subsequently  on april   fairchild bermuda  renamed global sources ltd  completed an exchange of approximately of its shares for of the shares of trade media holdings limited  an asian based  business to business online and traditional marketplace services provider 
immediately after the share exchange  our stockholders owned  shares of the  issued shares of global sources 
global sources shares are listed on the nasdaq under the symbol gsol 
this transaction allowed us to complete our formal plan to dispose of fairchild technologies and provided our shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in a new public entity 
consolidated results we currently report in three principal business segments aerospace fasteners  aerospace distribution and real estate operations 
the results of camloc gas springs division  prior to its disposition  were included in the corporate and other classification 
the following table provides the historical sales and operating income of our operations for fiscal  and the following table also illustrates sales and operating income of our operations by segment  on an unaudited pro forma basis  for fiscal  as if we had operated in a consistent manner in each of the reported periods 
the pro forma results represent the impact of our dispositions of dallas aerospace in december and camloc gas springs in september  as if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of fiscal the pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of these companies  giving effect to the aforementioned transactions 
the pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations  that would actually have occurred if these transactions had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal  nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results

fiscal results includes one time impairment charges of million in the aerospace fasteners segment  million in the aerospace distribution segment  and million in the real estate operations segment 
net sales of million in increased by million  or  compared to sales of million in results for the included revenue of million from an operation in our aerospace distribution segment  which was shut down in june excluding the results of the shut down operation  net sales would have increased by million  or  in  as compared to sales in reflected growth at our aerospace fasteners segment due to strong order activity prior to september  net sales of million in decreased by million  or  compared to sales of million in the results for  included revenue of million from dallas aerospace and the camloc gas springs division prior to their respective dispositions 
on a pro forma basis  adjusting for the dispositions  net sales increased by million for  as compared to rental revenue was million in  million in  and million in rental revenue decreased slightly in  due to a decrease in the amount of space leased to tenants during the year 
rental revenue was higher in the and periods due to an increase in the amount of space leased to tenants

the fiscal impairment charge included million due to the closing of a small subsidiary at our aerospace distribution segment  of which million represented the write off of goodwill  and million represented severance payments 
additionally  the fiscal impairment charge also included a write off of approximately million of improvements at our shopping center  and a million for the write off of leasehold improvements from the relocation of our domestic distribution facility in our aerospace fasteners segment 
in fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges as a result of the integration of kaynar technologies  acquired in april  into our aerospace fasteners segment 
all of the charges recorded were a direct result of product and plant integration costs incurred as of june  these costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of formal plans to move equipment  close plants and to terminate employees 
such costs are nonrecurring in nature 
other than a reduction in our existing cost structure  none of the restructuring charges resulted in future increases in earnings or represented an accrual of future costs 
operating income of million in increased million  or  compared to operating income of million in the results included goodwill amortization of million  prior to the implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that eliminates goodwill amortization in the period

the fair market value adjustment of our position in a ten year million interest rate contract decreased by million in fiscal and million in the fair market value adjustment of this agreement will generally fluctuate  based on the implied forward interest rate curve for month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease  and we will record income 
nonrecurring income of million in fiscal resulted from million  million  and million gains recognized on the disposition of our equity investment in nacanco paketleme  our camloc gas springs division and a smaller equity investment  respectively 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  representing a effective tax rate benefit on pre tax losses from continuing operations 
the tax benefit was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of million of tax accruals no longer required

in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million from the implementation of sfas no 
 presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting  as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
all of the impairment charge relates to the three operating units within our aerospace fasteners segment 
no tax effect was recognized on the change in accounting for goodwill 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  goodwill will be tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
all of our goodwill has been deemed to have an indefinite life  and as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill 
prior to the implementation of sfas no 
 we recognized amortization expense for goodwill of million and million  in and  respectively 
comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding changes in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities 
the fair market value of available for sale securities  on an after tax basis  declined by million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the changes in and reflect primarily gains realized from the liquidation of investments 
foreign currency translation adjustments improved by million in  which reflected the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar 
foreign currency translation adjustments decreased by million  and million in and  respectively  due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
we are currently evaluating a change in our method of accounting for our inventory costing at two of our domestic aerospace fasteners manufacturing operations from the last in  first out lifo method  to the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories accounted for using the lifo method represented only of our total inventory 
if we were to implement this change in method of inventory costing we will be required to retroactively restate our financial statements for the years ended june  and june   which were audited by arthur andersen llp 
since arthur andersen is no longer issuing audit opinions  our current auditors would be required to reaudit our financial statements for the periods ended june  and june  we adopted sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on july  at adoption  we recorded within other comprehensive income  a decrease of million in the fair market value of our million interest rate swap agreement 
the million decrease will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap agreement using the effective interest method 
the offsetting interest rate swap liability is separately being reported as a fair market value of interest rate contract within other long term liabilities 
in the statement of earnings we have recorded the net swap interest accrual as part of interest expense 
unrealized changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded net of the current interest accrual on a separate line entitled decrease in fair market value of interest rate derivatives 
segment results aerospace fasteners segment sales in our aerospace fasteners segment increased by million  or  in  as compared the improvement reflected internal growth  which was partially offset by a reduction in deliveries in the third and fourth quarters due to retrenchment in the aerospace industry following the september  terrorist attacks 
our backlog decreased by million in  to million at june  our book to bill ratio was in fiscal  reflecting the softening of new orders following september  sales in our aerospace fasteners segment increased by million  or  in  as compared to sales by our european operations were adversely affected by approximately million in  compared to  due to the foreign currency impact from the us dollar strengthening against the euro 
operating income increased by million  or  in  as compared to the improvement in was due primarily to the increase in sales and related economies of scale and the adoption  as of july   of a new accounting pronouncement that does not require us to amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization of million was recorded in we also recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the long lived assets of a small airframe manufacturing operation at our aerospace fasteners segment  that we are attempting to sell 
operating income increased by million in  compared to the increase was due primarily to productivity improvements from cost reduction efforts  offset partially by reduced gross margins resulting from pricing pressures 
operating income in was adversely affected by approximately million due to the foreign currency impact on our european operations 
announcements by our major customers have reinforced our view that projected aircraft build rates will be adversely affected by decreased worldwide demand for travel following september  accordingly  we believe overall demand for aerospace fasteners will decrease during the remainder of calendar  and our business will be affected by this decreased demand 
nevertheless  we also believe the impact on our business will be partially offset by the supply chain service programs we entered into during the past several years and by the decrease in fastener inventory available to oems and distributors 
we have decided to sell our fairchild fasteners business for approximately million in cash to alcoa inc the sale  which is expected to close before november   is subject to customary conditions  including regulatory approvals  the tendering of over of our senior subordinated debentures due april  and the approval of our shareholders see
