statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information under part i  special notes regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of forward looking information 
background we are actively engaged in various clinical efforts and market development strategies in the united states  european union  canada  australia and south africa 
disease categories under active development include me cfs  hepatitis and hiv 
we maintain offices and clinical operations in both the united states and the european union 
we have ownership interests in red laboratories a european based diagnostic company ribotech ltd 
a south african manufacturing entity  which produces our raw drug materials  chronix biomedical corp  a us company focusing on the development of diagnostics for chronic diseases and california institute of molecular medicine  a us company developing the replication of human kupffer s cells obtained from hcv infected patients 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred as expected substantial operating losses due to our conducting clinical testing 
prior to completing an initial public offering ipo in november  we financed operations primarily through the private placement of equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  interest income and revenues from licensing and royalty agreements 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of hemispherx biopharma  inc and its four wholly owned subsidiaries  biopro corp  bioaegean corp  core biotech corp 
and hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa the nv sa subsidiaries were incorporated in september for the purpose of developing technology for ultimate sale into certain non pharmaceutical specialty consumer markets 
the european subsidiary was formed for the purpose of serving our needs with respect to pursuing clinical trials regulatory approval and marketing in the european union 
the us subsidiaries are inactive at this time 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
in  we initiated a phase iii clinical study using ampligen to treat patients affected by me cfs at various medical centers in the united states 
me cfs patients that are not eligible for the phase iii clinical study may seek treatment under a me cfs cost recovery treatment program that has been authorized by the fda 
under the cost recovery program  enrolled patients pay for the cost of ampligen administered  which totals approximately  for a week treatment program 
patients are also treated in belgium  the united kingdom  austria  and australia under similar cost recovery programs 
we expect to continue our research and clinical efforts for the next several years with some benefit of certain revenues from our cost recovery treatment programs 
these cost recovery treatment sales were approximately  in fiscal year we may continue to incur losses over the next several years due to clinical and operating costs which may be partially offset by cost recovery treatment revenues and potential licensing fees 
such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of significant expenses incurred and receipt of licensing fees and or revenues 
acquisition of full or conditional marketing approval in any major market would significantly affect our cash flow 
there are no assurances that such approvals will ever occur in any major pharmaceutical market 
result of operations years ended december  vs 
net loss we reported a net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of approximately  for the year the increase in losses of  in was basically due to lower me cfs cost recovery treatment revenues and interest income 
in addition we recorded a non operating  non cash charge of  with respect to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
this amount represents the unamortized balance of goodwill included in the investments 
overall operating expenses in were  lower than operating expenses experienced in our loss per share was in and revenues at this time  our revenues come from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe 
these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
revenues from cost recovery treatment programs totaled some  in in  these revenues declined by  or 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to the focus of our clinical resources on conducting and completing the amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial as well as the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
revenues from the european cost recovery treatment programs were lower than expected primarily due to our european investigators spending a great deal of time in reviewing and analyzing the clinical data collected in the treatment of some patients in belgium 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the data collected in the us phase iii me cfs trial 
research and development costs as previously noted  our research and development is primarily directed at developing our lead product  ampligen  as a therapy for use in treating various chronic illnesses as well as cancer 
in and  most of this effort was directed toward conducting and supporting clinical trials involving patients affected with me cfs 
our research and development direct costs were  in compared to  spent in the lower research and development costs basically reflect the net sum of less costs related to lower cost recovery treatment revenues and lower expenses related to the me cfs clinical trials offset by increased purchases of polymers and increased expenses relating to the hiv trials initiated in as to be expected  costs related to the cost recovery treatment programs were down approximately  due to lower revenues recorded in also expenses relating to the me cfs phase iii clinical trial were down some  in versus due to fewer patients being treated in the cost intensive segment of the program as the clinical trial nears completion 
this clinical trial is a multicenter  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating me cfs patients with ampligen 
as of february  more than patients have been enrolled 
these lower costs relating to our me cfs programs were partially offset by an increase in polymer purchase in in the amount of  and an increase due to spending on the new hiv clinical trials now underway 
the polymer purchase increase was needed to boost our on hand inventory for the production of ampligen 
the hiv clinical trials were initiated to evaluate the use of ampligen in concert with other antiviral drugs in treating patients severely afflicted with aids 
we expect levels of these clinical trials to continue throughout we expect research and development expenditures to be lower than those incurred during general and administrative expenses excluding stock compensation expense  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in versus  in the decrease in expense is primary due to lower professional fees in all other general and administrative expenses were slightly less than recorded in stock compensation expenses were  or some  higher than recorded in the year the compensation reflects the imputed non cash expense recorded to reflect the cost of warrants granted to outside parties for services rendered to the company 
equity loss unconsolidated affiliates during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in cimm 
this is a result of management s determination that cimm s operations had not yet evolved to the point where our full carrying value of its investment could be supported pursuant to the guidelines of the accounting standards board opinion no 
the amount represents the unamortized balance of goodwill included as part of our investment 
other income expense interest and other income of  in was lower than the  recorded in significantly lower interest rates on money market accounts and lower cash available for investment basically account for the difference 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities which earned much lower interest income in years ended december  vs 
net loss we reported a net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of approximately  for the same period in several factors contributed to the  reduction of net losses in revenues overall revenues from the cost recovery treatment programs in the united states  canada and europe increased by  in compared to cost recovery revenues in the united states were up  or 
european cost recovery revenues declined by  or 
our european operation received a  research grant in from a france based pharmaceutical company 
research and development costs in  research and development costs increased  primarily due to a major increase in patients entering the amp me cfs clinical trial initiated by us in and our efforts in europe to increase the expanded me cfs access program in european countries other than belgium 
by year end we had engaged the services of eleven clinical investigators located throughout the united states to enroll eligible me cfs patients in the amp clinical program 
as of december  some patients were involved in the clinical study 
cost incurred in producing ampligen and other drugs for clinical studies were  in compared to  in the production costs reflect the build up of drug supplies needed to support clinical trials and other research and development efforts expected in and at present  we charge all raw material and related production costs to research and development expense as incurred 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were down  in compared to lower stock compensation expense accounted for  of this decrease 
this expense was  in versus  in stock compensation expense is a non cash expense that reflects the fair value of our common stock and warrants granted to non employees of our company for services or benefits provided 
the decrease in reflects fewer warrants granted to consultants and other service providers 
legal and related expenses in were lower by  compared to  primarily due to lower costs from litigation associated with the asensio company lawsuit  and other legal matters 
legal expenses associated with the company s defense of the asensio countersuit are mostly paid by our company s liability insurance carrier 
expenses associated with stock transactions  the filing of registration statements and financing costs were lower by  the cost of evaluating the feasibility of the proposed spin off of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  core biotech corp  was  in which did not occur in liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were  cash used for operating activities in was 
additional uses of cash included expenditures of  for patent acquisition cost   investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  and  to acquire  shares of our stock 
cash proceeds from financing activities in were   was received from the collection of stock subscriptions and  was generated from the exercise of warrants to acquire  shares of our stock 
these amounts were partially offset by  for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
our net operating cash burn rate for the last three months of fiscal year approximated  per month or  on an annualized basis 
all clinical trial drug supplies produced in were fully expensed although some costs are expected to be recovered under the expanded access cost recovery programs authorized by fda and regulatory bodies in other countries 
our operating cash burn rate should decline somewhat in as the amp me cfs clinical trial nears completion and the european market development activity increases cost recovery treatment revenues in europe 
also  certain of the operating  as well as the non operating cash outlays are of a one time nature and are expected to decline 
during march  hemispherx biopharma europe  sa hemispherx sa was authorized to issue up to  euros of seven percent convertible debentures 
such debentures will be guaranteed by the company and will be converted into a specified number of shares pursuant to the debenture agreement 
conversion is to occur on the earlier of an initial public offering of hemispherx sa on a european stock exchange or september  hemispherx sa has entered into a sales and distribution agreement agreement with a european entity 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement the european entity has been granted the exclusive right in spain  portugal and andorra to market ampligen for the treatment of myalgic encephalitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs 
in exchange for the exclusive right  the european entity which is to pay to hemispherx sa a current fee of  euros  a fee of  euros after fda approval of ampligen for the treatment of me cfs and a fee of  euros after issuance in spain of final marketing authorization for ampligen for the treatment of me cfs 
additionally  this entity has agreed to purchase from hemispherx sa  euros of hemispherx sa seven percent convertible debentures due september  as of december  we had  class a redeemable warrants outstanding 
these warrants  issued in connection with our initial public offering the company s ipo in  were originally termed to expire on november  in august  the board of directors extended the term of the warrants until november  due to the disruptive events of september  and related difficulties  the expiration date for exercising the class a redeemable warrants was extended to november  holders of these warrants exercised  at per share during the period between december  and november  the remaining class a redeemable warrants expired on november  holders of non public warrants exercised an aggregate of  shares in at an average exercise price of per share 
many of the warrants exercised were granted in and non public warrants outstanding were  as of december  with an average exercise price of per share 
based on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december  and projected operating cash needs  we expect to have sufficient cash on hand to fund operations through the second quarter of because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assest sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibited the use of the poling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that the company recognized acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combination initiated after june  and for purchase business combination completed on or after july  sfas address financial accounting for acquired goodwill and other tangibles 
it requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  currently  the company has no goodwill and will assess how the adoption of sfas and sfas will impact its financial position and results of operations on future acquisitions 
in august the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
the new guidance resolves significant implementation issues related to sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas is effected for fiscal years beginning after december  currently  we are assessing but have not determined how the adoption of sfas will impact our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commision  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or method used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting accounting policies are described in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  to be held and used by an entity  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of fixed assets and intangibles based on undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying values have been impaired  the measurement and recognition of the impairment will be based on estimated future operating cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment of  in connection with goodwill related to equity investments of ours 
this impairment is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated affiliates 
as of december   management believes that the remaining carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles have not been impaired 
patents and trademarks effective october   the company adopted a year estimated useful life for amortization of its patent and trademark rights in order to more accurately reflect their useful life 
prior to october   the company was using a year estimated useful life 
the adoption of the life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
as a result the effect on the company was a  reduction of research and development costs in the fourth quarter of the calendar year patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the assets 
the company reviews its patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential on an undiscounted cash basis to support the realizability of its respective capitalized cost 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into company s strategic business plans 
research and developments costs research and development costs are direct costs related to both future and present products and are charged to operations as incurred 
the company recognized research and development direct costs of   and  in  and respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk market risk we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding requirements  the excess cash was invested in three to six month high quality financial instruments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to any investment exposure
