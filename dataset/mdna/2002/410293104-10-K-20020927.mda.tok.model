item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in july to develop innovative handheld computers 
our goal is to become a global market leader in the handheld computing market  which includes the emerging market for integrated wireless devices offering voice  data  email and personal information management capabilities 
shipments of our first visor organizer products began in october beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we saw significant adverse changes in the handheld organizer market due to the economic slowdown  excess channel inventory  aggressive price reductions and increased competition from both pocketpc and palm os handheld organizer manufacturers 
these conditions continued throughout fiscal  and contributed in part to a decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal significant accomplishments during fiscal included the following we began shipping our treo communicators for operation with gsm networks the monochrome treo and the color treo we also released treo mail  our wireless email solution for treo communicators 
we added two new products to our visor organizer family in september  visor neo for the entry level market  and visor pro for the professional market 
in june  we shipped the treo  a color organizer with the same form factor as our treo communicators that features an integrated  physical keyboard 
we released a new version of blazer  our web browser  that supports five languages english  french  italian  german and spanish 
blazer continues to be viewed as a leading web browser for palm os devices  and is a key component for treo 
we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  plus an additional  shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
in addition  qualcomm incorporated made an investment of million to purchase million shares of our common stock 
net of offering expenses  these transactions resulted in proceeds of million 
we significantly reduced operating expenses 
excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles  operating expenses declined by million  or  from fiscal to fiscal we believe that integrated wireless devices will be the future of handheld computing 
as a result of this belief  we are in the process of transitioning handspring from a company focused on standalone handheld computers  to a company aimed at becoming a leader in the emerging category of wireless communicators 
this transition may take some time as products are introduced and advanced  as the networks mature their data offerings  and as customers become more familiar with these new offerings 
while we continue to sell organizers  we have shifted much of our future product development towards wireless communicators  which we believe represents a potentially large  new category of computing and communications devices 

table of contents significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue to date is comprised almost entirely of sales of our organizers and communicators 
retail sales orders are placed in our internal order processing system 
product orders placed by end user customers are received via our web site or over the telephone via our third party customer support partner 
all orders are then transmitted to our logistics partners 
we recognize revenue when a purchase order has been received  the product has been shipped  title has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales of our handheld communicators may also include subsidy revenue from wireless carriers for new customer service contracts or the extension of existing customer contracts 
in these cases  the customer has a specified period of time in which they may cancel their service 
all revenue related to these subsidies is deferred until this specified period of time has elapsed 
no significant post delivery obligations exist with respect to revenue recognized 
returns reserve we offer limited return rights on our products and accordingly  at the time the related sale is recorded  we reduce revenues for estimated returns 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically and are based upon various factors including historical rates of returns and inventory levels in the channel 
we also estimate and reserve for rebates and price protection based upon specific programs 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
warranty reserve the cost of product warranties is estimated and accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failures rates  component costs and repair service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  component costs or repair service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty costs would be required 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers 
all highly liquid debt or equity instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
those with original maturities greater than three months and current maturities less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered short term investments  and those with maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments 
all short term and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are stated at market value with any temporary difference between an investment s amortized cost and its market value recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until such gains or losses are realized 
gains or losses on the sales of securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at face value  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate calculated based on an analysis of current business and economic risks  customer credit worthiness  credit card fraud  specific identifiable risks such as bankruptcies  terminations or discontinued customers  or other factors that may indicate a potential loss 
the allowance is reviewed on a consistent basis to ensure that it adequately provides for all reasonably expected losses in the receivable balances 
an account may be determined to be uncollectable if all collection efforts have been exhausted  the customer has filed for bankruptcy and all recourse against the account is exhausted  or disputes are unresolved and negotiations to settle are exhausted 
this uncollectable amount is written off as bad debt against the allowance 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventories are made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
these provisions are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measured at tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
results of operations revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  a decline of million from fiscal revenue of million 
the decrease was primarily due to the following factors there was a decline in unit shipments of our visor organizers 
we believe that unit sales decreased due to economic weakness  a significant slowing in the growth rate of the organizer market  excess inventories  increased competition  and our shift in focus from organizer products to communicator products 
there was a decline in the average selling price for our visor organizers  which was primarily attributable to pricing and promotion actions that we initiated to reduce channel inventory  as well as a general reduction in the market prices for handheld organizers 
the decrease in visor organizer revenue was offset in part by revenue generated from the first shipments of our treo products  which began shipping internationally at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  and began shipping in north america during the third quarter of fiscal fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million from fiscal revenue of million 
this increase in revenue was primarily due to the following factors we began shipping products during the second quarter of fiscal therefore  on a comparative basis  there was only a partial year of product shipments during fiscal compared to a full year of product shipments during fiscal we expanded our distribution channels 
our first product shipments were only for orders received through our web site 
toward the end of the third quarter of fiscal we began selling our products through select retailers 
during the following five quarters we added additional retailers  distributors and e commerce partners throughout the united states 
we entered a number of international markets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we launched our products in asia pacific  canada  europe  japan and the middle east 
as a result of this global expansion  revenue outside north america represented of revenue during fiscal as compared to of revenue during fiscal we added several new products to our visor family of handheld computers during fiscal  including visor prism  visor platinum and visor edge  all with higher average selling prices than our initial visor and visor deluxe products that first shipped in fiscal cost of revenue 
cost of revenue was million during fiscal  a decline of million from cost of revenue of million during fiscal excluding the amortization of deferred stock compensation  cost of revenue resulted in gross margin declining from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to aggressive pricing and promotion actions taken in order to increase demand and reduce inventory of our organizer products 
the negative effect of the pricing and promotion actions on gross margin was partially offset by higher margins on the sales of our treo line of products beginning in the second quarter of fiscal also offsetting the decrease in gross margin was a slightly higher percentage of our products sold through our web site during fiscal as compared with fiscal sales through our web site typically generate higher gross margins as compared to retail sales 
cost of revenue during fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal cost of revenue of million 
excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation  cost of revenue resulted 
table of contents in gross margin declining from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to three factors 
first  we incurred a million charge in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of excess and obsolete inventory and changes in our product development plans 
second  we took pricing and product promotion actions in order to increase demand and reduce inventory 
third  retail sales made up a larger percentage of fiscal revenue  which generated lower gross margins  as compared to the prior fiscal year where we experienced a higher percentage of direct sales through our web site 
these factors that adversely affected gross margin were partially offset by our introduction of new products with higher average sales prices and higher gross margins during fiscal we expect gross margin to improve as treo becomes a larger percentage of our product mix 
however  future gross margins may be adversely affected by new product introductions by our competitors  competitor pricing actions and higher inventory balances 
we also expect our gross margin to fluctuate in the future due to channel mix  geographic mix  new product introductions  seasonal effects  and timing and amount of carrier subsidies 
research and development 
research and development expenses during fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from million during fiscal research and development expenses during fiscal increased million  or  from million during fiscal the increases in both years were primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel required for development of new products  including our treo communicator during fiscal we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our plan to continue to develop wireless communicator products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal were million  a decline of million  or  from million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to significant reductions in advertising and marketing activities  as well as the restructuring of our customer support organization and general cost reductions made company wide 
selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased million  or  from million during fiscal this increase reflected the additional costs and expenses relating to the overall expansion in our level of operations required to support our revenue growth during this period  including increased sales and marketing activities for four new products introduced in fiscal  expenses related to our efforts to increase recognition of our brand name and expenses related to putting in place the infrastructure required for a rapidly growing public company 
in process research and development 
in february  we completed our acquisition of bluelark systems  a provider of client and server based software designed to deliver content and services to wirelessly connected mobile devices 
under the terms of the agreement related to this acquisition  we issued  shares and options to purchase handspring s common stock in exchange for all of bluelark system s outstanding shares and options for a total purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
in connection with the acquisition of bluelark systems  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development during fiscal for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
an independent valuation was performed to assist us in determining the fair value of the total purchase price to allocate to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from bluelark systems  including in process research and development 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was determined by assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development efforts at the acquisition date and calculating the net present value of cash flows expected to result from the new technology 
the estimated net present value of cash flows took into account the characteristics and applications of the technologies  the size and growth rate of existing and future markets and an evaluation of past and anticipated technology and product life cycles 
these cash flows included the after tax effects of future revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses  working capital charge and expenditures for capital and intangibles 
both the estimated stage of completion and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value factored into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful deployment of the new technology resulting from the in process research and development effort 

table of contents amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles 
we recognized million  million and million of amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles during fiscal  and  respectively 
this amount is primarily related to the stock options that we granted to our officers and employees prior to our initial public offering on june   at prices subsequently deemed to be below the fair value of the underlying stock 
the cumulative difference between the fair value of the underlying stock at the date the options were granted and the exercise price of the granted options was million 
in addition  in february  we recorded million of deferred stock compensation in relation to the unvested stock options and restricted stock assumed in the acquisition of bluelark systems 
all of the deferred stock compensation is being amortized  using the multiple option method  over the vesting period of the related options and restricted stock 
accordingly  our results of operations will include amortization of deferred stock compensation through fiscal as part of the acquisition of bluelark systems  we also recorded intangible assets consisting of goodwill and assembled workforce of  these assets were amortized from the date of acquisition through fiscal on a straight line basis over three years 
however  with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in fiscal  the value of assembled workforce will be reclassified and recorded as goodwill  and the amortization will be discontinued 
instead  the unamortized balance of  at june  will be subject to an impairment test at least annually 
future amortization of deferred stock compensation is estimated to be million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million during fiscal  a decline of million from million in fiscal this decrease was a result of decreased interest income from lower average cash and investment balances as well as lower interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest and other income  net during fiscal increased by million from  in fiscal this increase is a result of increased interest income from higher average cash and investment balances primarily resulting from our financing activities  including million of net proceeds received from our initial public offering on june   and million of net proceeds received in july  when our underwriters exercised their over allotment option 
also included within this line item are gains and losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily caused from the movement between the euro and the us dollar on our foreign subsidiaries us dollar liabilities 
these fluctuations partially offset the decrease in interest and other income  net during fiscal and partially offset the increase during fiscal we have in the past entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures 
during fiscal  interest and other income  net also included the amortization of costs associated with a subordinated debt facility agreement that we entered into in june these costs relate to the inclusion of a right granted to our lender to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock 
the total cost was amortized over the month term of the agreement 
income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was million  million and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign taxes related to our business outside of the united sates of america 
the fluctuations in the provision for income taxes during fiscal through fiscal relate to the increase during fiscal and the decrease during fiscal in the level of our operations outside of the united states 
no provision for federal income taxes was recorded because we have experienced significant net losses  which have resulted in deferred tax assets 
we provided a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets because  in light of our history of operating losses  we are presently unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  down million from million as of june  this decrease is primarily attributable to cash used in operations  partially offset by the net proceeds received from the underwritten public offering and private offering we completed during december as well as the movement of investments from long term to short term 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net losses offset partially by the non cash charge for amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and amortization 
the losses during fiscal were also offset by the non cash charges for the write off of excess and obsolete inventories as well as in process research and development associated with our acquisition of bluelark systems 
during fiscal  additional contributors to the use of cash were an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in current liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the timing of shipments in the last quarter of fiscal compared with the previous year  and the decrease in current liabilities was due to a general decrease in the level of operations throughout the year as well as the payment for excess and obsolete inventories reserved for in the previous year 
also  during fiscal we changed our business practice with our logistics partners  whereby we now own all inventory held at their facilities 
this change in practice caused a decrease in prepaid expenses and an increase in inventory on the balance sheet 
during fiscal  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories contributed to the net cash used in operating activities 
these increases were primarily a result of the prepayment of foreign taxes  prepayments made to our suppliers for inventory that they held on our behalf and purchases of long lead time  handspring specific  product components 
a decrease in accounts receivable during fiscal  due to the timing of shipments in the last quarter of fiscal compared with fiscal  and an increase in current liabilities  due to a general increase in the level of operations during the year  partially offset the cash used during fiscal during fiscal  an increase in accounts receivable contributed to the use of cash in operating activities  reflecting the commencement of product sales  offset by a significant increase in current liabilities due to a general increase in the level of operations during that year 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal  primarily attributable to proceeds received from maturities or sales of available for sale securities  partially offset by purchases of available for sale securities  and to a lesser extent  purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the uses of cash primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment  available for sale securities and purchases of investments for collateral on our operating leases  partially offset by proceeds received from maturities or sales of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal resulted primarily from the public sale of our common stock and a million investment from qualcomm incorporated  for total net proceeds of million 
the million provided by financing activities during fiscal resulted primarily from the underwriters of our initial public offering exercising their over allotment to purchase  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
during fiscal  the most significant component of cash provided by financing activities was million received from our initial public offering  as well as million of net proceeds that we received from the issuance of series b preferred stock and million when our subordinated debt lender exercised its option to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock at per share 
in addition  we received proceeds of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  from the issuance of common stock under stock option plans and stock purchase plans 
we have pledged a portion of our investment securities as collateral for specified obligations under lease agreements for two buildings totaling approximately  square feet that are being constructed in sunnyvale  california 
both leases have initial terms of twelve years 
monthly rent expense of million and monthly operating expenses of approximately  are expected to commence during the second quarter 
table of contents of fiscal  with annual rent increases determined in part by the consumer price index 
the minimum monthly rent payment in the twelfth year is million 
as of june  there was million pledged in relation to these leases 
of the amount pledged million is designated by the agreements to be utilized for tenant improvements 
the remaining portion of the pledged investment represents a security deposit on the property 
as of june  there was also a total of million pledged as collateral for lease payments for various other leases expiring between june and june  as well as foreign taxes 
given that our existing office space is adequate to meet our current requirements  our current plan is to sublease at least one  and possibly both  of the two sunnyvale buildings 
we have engaged a real estate broker to market the space but have not yet secured any subtenants 
subleasing is difficult given the substantial decline in the commercial real estate market in silicon valley 
accordingly  any space that we do sublease will be at a rental rate significantly below our lease rate 
at the same time that we are attempting to sublease the buildings  we also are in discussions with the developer to negotiate a potential buy out or restructuring of our leases 
today we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions 
however  as a result of either subleasing the buildings  or a buy out or restructuring of the leases  we anticipate taking a significant  one time  charge relating to these buildings in the december quarter of fiscal moreover  in either case  the resulting expense will be substantial and will adversely affect our cash resources 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of our revenue and expenses and the extent of our lease obligations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  including our lease obligations  we may need additional cash to finance our operating and investing needs 
however  depending on market conditions  any additional financing we need may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate significant operating activities which may include certain research and development or marketing programs 
accordingly  the inability to obtain needed financing could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to invest the cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities with maturities no greater than two years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under sfas a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of is established 
the accounting model is based on the framework established in sfas and resolves certain implementation issues 
sfas is effective beginning in fiscal the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf  issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which codified and reconciled eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  issues and of issue no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including both a reseller of the vendor s products and an entity that purchases the vendor s products from the reseller 
any consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller  or a customer of a reseller is generally presumed to be a reduction of selling price  and therefore  a reduction of revenue 
that presumption can be overcome if the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration paid that is sufficiently separable from the sale to the recipient  and the vendor can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit  in which 
table of contents case the consideration is characterized as an expense 
we adopted eitf during fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
factors affecting future results if we are not successful in the development and introduction of new products  particularly new wireless communicator products and related services  our business would be substantially harmed 
we depend on our ability to develop new or enhanced products and services that achieve rapid and broad market acceptance 
we may fail to identify new product and service opportunities successfully or to develop and bring to market new products and services in a timely manner 
in addition  our new products and services may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability 
if we are unsuccessful in developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to customers  our business and operating results would be negatively impacted 
if we fail to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately or are otherwise unable to complete the development of products and services in a timely fashion  we will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market  which will affect our ability to successfully compete 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new products on a timely or cost effective basis or that customer demand will meet our expectations 
successful new product introductions are particularly important given our shift in development focus from organizers to wireless communicators 
this shift in focus requires that our limited resources be directed more towards the development of communicators and less on traditional organizers where we have more extensive engineering  production and marketing experience 
visorphone  which was our first attempt to offer a product combining wireless communications features with an organizer  did not achieve significant commercial success 
our new treo family of wireless communicators is the next step in our ongoing development effort focused on new wireless technologies 
our business would be substantially harmed if we fail to successfully develop and commercialize new communicators and other innovative wireless products and services 
we depend on wireless carriers for the success of our treo communicator products 
the success of our treo communicators is highly dependent on our ability to establish appropriate relationships  and build on our existing relationships  with wireless carriers 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in advancing our relationships with wireless carriers or that these wireless carriers will act in a manner that will promote the success of treo 
factors that are largely within the control of wireless carriers but which are important to the success of our treo communicators  include the wireless carriers interest in testing treo on their networks  the quality and coverage area of voice and data services offered by the wireless carriers for use with treo  the degree to which wireless carriers will facilitate the successful introduction of treo and actively promote treo  the extent to which wireless carriers will require specific hardware and software features on treo communicators to be used on their networks  
table of contents the extent to which carriers will sell and promote competitive products over treo and coverage area of voice and data services offered by the wireless carriers for use with treo  and the pricing and terms of voice and data rate plans that the wireless carriers will offer for use with treo 
the success of our treo communicator products requires both network and software upgrades we also depend on wireless carriers to build out advanced wireless networks in a timely manner 
advanced wireless networks such as general packet radio services gprs  also known as g and xrtt also know as g are expected to enhance the user experience for email and other services through higher speed and always on functionality 
we are working to develop products that utilize these advanced wireless networks and recently shipped the treo designed to operate on sprint s cdma xrtt network 
we are now in the process of releasing a firmware update that allows treo and treo users to upgrade their devices to take advantage of new gprs data services on select carrier networks 
delays in the roll out of gprs networks  or our failure to complete as scheduled the release of the treo software upgrade that is needed for treo to effectively operate with gprs networks  could adversely affect our business 
our treo communicator products present many significant manufacturing  marketing and other operational risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
the shift in focus of our business from traditional handheld computers to our treo wireless communicator products presents many significant manufacturing  marketing and other operational risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could affect the success of treo include our dependence on third parties to supply components  such as wavecom and airprime which provide radios for our gsm and cdma based treo communicators  respectively  our ability to manufacture our treo products in sufficient volumes on a timely basis  the type of distribution channels where treo will be available  our ability to forecast demand accurately  especially for products such as treo communicators which are in a new product category for which relevant data is incomplete or not available  the end user price of treo  and the extent of consumer acceptance of this new product category  which combines multiple functions in a pocket sized device 
our relationship with sprint is particularly important to the success of our business 
in march  we announced an agreement to work with sprint to develop a new cdma version of the treo communicator that operates on sprint s g network 
this jointly labeled product  the treo  became commercially available in august the treo is principally sold and promoted by sprint and sales of this product are expected to constitute a significant portion of our revenues for the remainder of the calendar year 
since the treo is customized for the sprint network  handspring currently will manufacture the product only in volumes that are supported by sprint purchase orders or if sprint assumes financial liability for long lead time components 
if sprint does not sell and promote the product to the extent we anticipate  future purchase orders from sprint may be deferred and our business will be harmed 
the amount of future carrier subsidies is uncertain and carriers are free to lower or reduce their subsidies with little or no notice to handspring 
when we sell a treo communicator on our own web site  we sometimes have the opportunity to earn subsidies from carriers if the treo communicator customer also purchases a voice or data plan from the carrier 
today the wireless industry is generally decreasing subsidies on voice services 
moreover  carriers that currently provide handspring with subsidies may reduce or discontinue such subsidies with little or no notice to handspring 
while we believe carriers will continue to offer subsidies to handspring  particularly given their 
table of contents need to sign up new data service customers  if these subsidies were reduced or eliminated the gross margins for treo communicators would decline and we would be more limited in our ability to sell treo communicators at prices that are attractive to cost sensitive consumers 
we face economic exposure with respect to our lease obligations as a result of excess leased real estate 
in february  we entered into lease agreements for two buildings totaling approximately  square feet that are being constructed in sunnyvale  california 
both leases have initial terms of twelve years 
monthly rent expense of million and monthly operating expenses of approximately  are expected to commence during the second quarter of fiscal  with annual rent increases determined in part by the consumer price index 
given that our existing office space is adequate to meet our current requirements  our current plan is to sublease at least one  and possibly both  of the two sunnyvale buildings 
we have engaged a real estate broker to market the space but have not yet secured any subtenants 
subleasing is difficult given the substantial decline in the commercial real estate market in silicon valley 
accordingly  any space that we do sublease will be at a rental rate significantly below our lease rate 
at the same time that we are attempting to sublease the buildings  we also are in discussions with the developer to negotiate a potential buy out or restructuring of our leases 
today we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions 
however  as a result of either subleasing the buildings  or a buy out or restructuring of the leases  we anticipate taking a significant  one time  charge relating to these buildings in the december quarter of fiscal moreover  in either case  the resulting expense will be substantial and will adversely affect our cash resources 
economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our products 
the downturn in general economic conditions and the substantial decline in the stock market have led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including many technology products 
if conditions continue to decline  or fail to improve  we could see a significant additional decrease in the overall demand for our products that could harm our operating results 
this is particularly true with respect to our treo communicators as they typically carry a list price between and and therefore are expensive purchases for many consumers 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
we began selling our visor handheld computer and generating revenue in the quarter ended january  we began volume shipments of our treo communicator products during the quarter ended march  while we continue to manufacture and sell organizer products  we are transitioning from a company primarily focused on organizers  to a company primarily focused on the emerging market for handheld communicators 
given our limited operating history and the shift in our focus from organizers to communicators  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
in some future periods  our results of operations could be below the expectations of investors and public market analysts 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we depend heavily on our license from palmsource 
our failure to maintain this license  a change in palmsource s business focus or an adverse outcome in any of the lawsuits involving the palm os could seriously harm our business 
our license of the palm os operating system is critical for the operation of our products 
if the license is not maintained or if palmsource  the newly established  wholly owned subsidiary of palm that owns and controls the palm os platform  changes its business focus  it could seriously harm our business 
this could happen in several ways 
first  we could breach the license agreement  in which case palmsource would be entitled to terminate the license 
second  if palmsource were to be acquired  the new licensor may not be as strategically aligned with us as palmsource even though it would be obligated to honor our license agreement 

table of contents third  we are dependent on palmsource s os group to continuously upgrade the palm os to operate on faster processors and otherwise remain competitive with other handheld operating systems 
the palm os operating system license agreement  which was transferred from palm to palmsource  was renewed in april and extends until april upon expiration or termination of the license agreement  other than due to our breach  we may choose to keep the license granted under the agreement for two years following its expiration or termination 
however  the license during this two year period is limited and does not entitle us to upgrades to the palm os operating system 
in addition  there are limitations on our ability to assign the palmsource license to a third party 
the existence of these license termination provisions and limitations on assignment may have an anti takeover effect in that it could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us 
suits against palm and palmsource involving the palm os operating system could adversely affect us 
palm is a defendant in several intellectual property lawsuits involving the palm os operating system 
although we are not a party to these cases and we are indemnified by palm for damages arising from lawsuits of this type  we could still be adversely affected by a determination adverse to palm or palmsource as a result of market uncertainty or product changes that could arise from such a determination 
while we are not contractually precluded from licensing or developing an alternative operating system  doing so could be less desirable and could be costly in terms of cash and other resources 
we have a history of losses  we expect losses to continue and we might not achieve or maintain profitability 
our accumulated deficit as of june  was million 
we had net losses of million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during the period from july  date of inception to june  we also expect to continue to incur substantial non cash costs relating to the amortization of deferred compensation  which will contribute to our net losses 
as of june   we had a total of million of deferred compensation to be amortized 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business will be harmed 
we might need additional capital in the future and additional financing might not be available 
in december  we completed an underwritten public offering as well as a non underwritten transaction with qualcomm incorporated 
net of offering expenses  these transactions resulted in proceeds of million 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our resources may prove to be insufficient for working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing in order to take advantage of opportunities  including the purchase of technologies or acquisitions of complementary businesses  meet our lease obligations with respect to our sunnyvale facilities  develop new products or services  or respond to competitive pressures 
depending on market conditions  any additional financing we need may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we might not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop new products or services or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures and our business could be harmed 

table of contents we are highly dependent on retailers and distributors to sell our products and disruptions in these channels and other effects of selling through retailers and distributors would harm our ability to sell our products 
we sell our products through numerous retailers and distributors as well as online through our handspring 
com web site and e commerce partners 
currently  our largest retail partner is best buy 
we also sell in international markets and offer our products through distributors in asia pacific  canada  europe and the middle east 
disruptions to these channels would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
we are subject to many risks relating to the distribution of our products by retailers and distributors  including the following product returns from retailers and distributors when handspring determines their inventories exceed appropriate levels  retailers and distributors may not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand or may elect not to carry our new wireless communicator products such as treo  retailers and distributors may emphasize our competitors products or decline to carry our products  as the global information technology market weakens  the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of these distributors and retailers increases  which could cause a disruption in distribution as well as a loss of any of our outstanding accounts receivable  conflicts may develop between the retail and distribution channels and direct sales of our products through our handspring 
com web site and by our e commerce partners  and if we reduce the prices of our products  as we have in the past  in order to maintain good business relations  we may compensate retailers and distributors for the difference between the higher price they paid to buy their inventory and the new lower prices 
a portion of our revenue has been derived from sales on our web site and system failures or delays have in the past and might in the future harm our business 
a portion of our revenue is generated through our web site 
as a result  we must maintain our computer systems in good operating order and protect them against damage from fire  water  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  vandalism and other malicious acts and similar unexpected adverse events 
our web servers currently are co located with the exodus service provided by cable wireless plc 
any disruption in these services or the failure of these services to handle current or higher volumes of use could have a material adverse affect on our business 
despite precautions we have taken and improvements we have made  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have in the past and could in the future cause temporary interruptions or delays in the services we provide 
sustained or repeated system failures or delays would affect our reputation  which would harm our business 
while we carry business interruption insurance  it might not be sufficient to cover any serious or prolonged emergencies 
our production could be seriously harmed if we experience component shortages or if our suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
our products contain components  including liquid crystal displays  touch panels  connectors  memory chips and microprocessors  that are procured from a variety of suppliers 
we rely on our suppliers to deliver necessary components to our contract manufacturer in a timely manner based on forecasts that we provide 
at various times  some of the key components for handheld computers have been in short supply due to high industry demand 
shortages of components  such as those that have occurred in the handheld computer industry  would harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis 
some components  such as power supply integrated circuits  radios  microprocessors and certain discrete components  come from sole or single source suppliers 
for example  wavecom is the sole supplier of certain 
table of contents wireless technology components for our treo and communicators 
alternative sources are not currently available for these sole and single source components 
if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for sole source components and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price for an alternative source is prohibitive  we might not be able to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products 
this problem is compounded when the sole or single source supplier is facing financial difficulties and the possibility of discontinuing its operations 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
the markets for handheld organizers and wireless communication products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase 
some of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
our products compete with a variety of handheld devices  including keyboard based devices  sub notebook computers  smart phones and two way pagers 
our principal competitors include the palm solutions group  a subsidiary of palm  inc  which develops  manufactures and markets handheld devices and which is now physically separated from palmsource  the licensor of palm os software 
research in motion limited  a leading provider of wireless email  instant messaging and internet connectivity  personal computer companies such as hewlett packard and acer  mobile handset manufacturers such as audiovox  ericsson  kyocera  lg  motorola  nokia  sanyo and samsung  consumer electronics companies such as casio  sharp and sony  and a variety of privately held start up companies looking to compete in our current and future markets  such as danger and good technologies 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products  services and technologies 
successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could reduce the sales and market acceptance of our products  cause intense price competition and result in reduced gross margins and lower our market share 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
if we fail to keep up with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  intense competition and frequent new product introductions 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to changes in technology or industry standards  our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use leading technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise  enhance our current products and develop new products that meet changing customer needs  time new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  
table of contents adjust the prices of our existing products to increase customer demand  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in effectively using new technologies  developing new products  or enhancing our existing products on a timely basis 
these new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense 
we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change 
these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept 
finally  we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge 
if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for our products  we may have costly excess production or not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost effective production of our products 
the demand for our products depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast  particularly given that we have multiple products  intense competition and a difficult economic environment 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause problems in our operations 
if demand does not develop as expected  we could have excess production resulting in excess finished products and components and may be required to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges 
we have limited capability to reduce manufacturing capacity once a purchase order has been placed and in some circumstances we would incur cancellation charges or other liabilities to our manufacturing partners if we cancel or reschedule purchase orders 
moreover  if we reduce manufacturing capacity  we would incur higher per unit costs based on smaller volume purchases 
if demand exceeds our expectations  we will need to rapidly increase production at our third party manufacturer 
our suppliers will also need to provide additional volumes of components  which may not be possible within our timeframes 
even if our third party manufacturer is able to obtain enough components  they might not be able to produce enough of our products as fast as we need them 
the inability of either our manufacturer or our suppliers to increase production rapidly enough could cause us to fail to meet customer demand 
in addition  rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses 
these higher costs would lower our profit margins 
if solectron fails to produce quality products on time and in sufficient quantities  our reputation and results of operations would suffer 
we depend on a single third party manufacturer  solectron  to produce sufficient volume of our products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality levels 
the cost  quality and availability of solectron s manufacturing operations are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
under our manufacturing agreement with solectron we order products on a purchase order basis in accordance with a forecast 
the absence of dedicated capacity under our manufacturing agreement with solectron means that  with little or no notice  solectron could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of the units of our devices that we require or change the terms under which they manufacture our devices  such as our credit terms 
if they were to stop manufacturing our devices  it could take from three to six months to secure alternative manufacturing capacity and our results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  if solectron were to change the terms under which they manufacture for us  our manufacturing costs could increase and our results of operations could suffer 
our reliance on solectron exposes us to risks outside our control  including the following unexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs  interruptions in shipments if they are unable to complete production  inability to control quality of finished products  
table of contents inability to control delivery schedules  the risks associated with international operations in guadalajara  mexico where solectron maintains facilities  and unpredictability of manufacturing yields 
we rely on third parties for order fulfillment  repair services and technical support 
our reputation and results of operations could be harmed by our inability to control their operations 
we rely on third parties to package and ship customer orders  repair units and provide technical support 
if our order fulfillment services  repair services or technical support services are interrupted or experience quality problems  our ability to meet customer demands would be harmed  causing a loss of revenue and harm to our reputation 
although we have the ability to add new service providers or replace existing ones  transition difficulties and lead times involved in developing additional or new third party relationships could cause interruptions in services and harm our business 
we face seasonality in our sales  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
seasonal variations in our sales may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
we have experienced seasonality in the sales of our products with increased demand typically occurring in our second fiscal quarter 
this increase in demand is due in part to increased consumer spending on electronic devices during the holiday season  in particular during the last few weeks of december 
in addition  demand for our products may decline after the holiday season  particularly during the summer months because of typical decreased consumer spending patterns during this period 
our failure to develop brand recognition could limit or reduce the demand for our products 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands is critical to increasing demand for and achieving widespread acceptance of our products 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have better name recognition and more powerful brands  particularly those competitors in the wireless communications industry 
promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to produce well received new products 
however  currently we have limited our marketing resources in response to reducing our overall costs 
moreover  brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues or customer loyalty and  even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brands 
our products may contain errors or defects that could result in the rejection of our products and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
our products are complex and must meet stringent user requirements 
we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing handheld computing and communications markets 
products as sophisticated as ours are likely to contain detected and undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released 
for example  any such undetected errors or defects in our treo communicator line of products could adversely impact market acceptance of this product line  which would hurt our business 
we may experience delays in releasing new products or producing them in significant volumes as problems are corrected 
from time to time  we have become aware of problems with components and other defects 
errors or defects in our products that are significant  or are perceived to be significant  could result in the rejection of the products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims 
in addition  we warrant that our hardware will be free of defects for one year after the date of purchase 
in europe  we are required by law in some countries to provide a two year warranty for certain defects 
delays  costs and damage to our reputation due to product defects could harm our business 

table of contents in july  we discovered a defect in a component of the backlight assembly in some treo and treo products  which can render the backlight inoperable 
while we believe most of our treo and treo products will not experience this problem  we decided to screen all units in our inventory for the defective component  and are building new products with verified components 
as a cautionary measure  we suspended shipments of treo and treo for a period of approximately two weeks 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our facilities  information systems and general business operations  and those of our partners and customers  are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars and other events beyond our control 
the business interruption insurance we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we lose our key personnel  we may not be able to manage our business successfully 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel and their ability to execute our growth strategy 
in particular  we rely on jeffrey c 
hawkins  our chief product officer  donna l 
dubinsky  our chief executive officer  and edward t 
colligan  our chief operating officer 
the loss of the services of any of these or any of our other senior level management  or other key employees could harm our business 
mr 
hawkins recently has formed a non profit organization  the redwood neuroscience institute  to pursue his life long interest in brain research 
he is now dividing his time between the redwood neuroscience institute and handspring  where he will continue to serve as chief product officer and as chairman of the board of directors 
at handspring  he will focus on strategic product planning and new product directions 
should mr 
hawkins increase the allocation of his time to the redwood neuroscience institute such that he cannot participate in product planning at handspring  our business could be harmed 
if we fail to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  our ability to execute our business plan would be compromised 
our future success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
although we provide compensation packages that include stock options  cash incentives and other employee benefits  we may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
if we fail to retain  hire and integrate qualified employees and contractors  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
in addition  when our common stock price is less than the exercise price of stock options granted to employees  turnover may increase  which could harm our results of operations or financial condition 
in order to help retain employees  we recently offered our employees the right to participate in an option exchange program pursuant to which they were given the right to choose to exchange unexercised stock options for new stock options with a new exercise price to be granted at least six months and one day following the cancellation of their existing stock options on 
the terms of the replacement options will be substantially the same as the cancelled options  except that in most circumstances there will be an additional cliff period of up to six months imposed on the vesting schedule of the option that will limit the ability of the option holder to exercise the option 
of the  shares subject to stock options that were eligible for the exchange program  a total of  such options shares were submitted and accepted for exchange on may  we currently anticipate that replacement options will be granted on or soon after november  we depend on proprietary rights to develop and protect our technology 
our success and ability to compete substantially depends on our internally developed proprietary technologies  which we protect through a combination of trade secret  trademark  copyright and patent laws 

table of contents while we have numerous patent applications pending  to date no us or foreign patents have been granted to us 
patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved 
even if they are approved  our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
in addition  any patents that may be granted to us may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our competitive position could suffer 
we may be required to spend significant resources to protect  monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
we could be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property  which could result in significant expense and loss of intellectual property rights 
our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and frequent intellectual property litigation  especially regarding patent rights 
from time to time  third parties have in the past and may in the future assert patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
in particular  as our focus has shifted to wireless communicators  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  communications from holders of patents related to gsm  gprs  cdma and other mobile communication standards 
any litigation to determine the validity of intellectual property claims  including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our business partners  regardless of their merit or resolution  would likely be costly and time consuming and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
we cannot assure that we would prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if such litigation resulted in an adverse ruling  we could be required to pay substantial damages and costs  cease the manufacture  use or sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain technology  or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
handspring currently is a defendant in the three patent infringement lawsuits described below  all of which we believe are without merit and intend to vigorously defend 
our policy is to vigorously defend meritless lawsuits while respecting the intellectual property rights of others 
on march   ncr corporation filed suit against handspring and palm  inc in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint alleges infringement of two us patents 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and treble damages and to permanently enjoin the defendants from infringing the patents in the future 
we filed an answer on april   denying ncr s allegations and asserting counterclaims for declaratory judgments that we do not infringe the patents in suit  that the patents in suit are invalid  and that they are unenforceable 
on june   following the retirement of the judge hearing the case  the case was referred to a magistrate 
on july   the magistrate granted handspring s motion for summary judgment finding that handspring did not infringe the patents 
on august   ncr filed an objection to the magistrate s ruling and handspring currently is preparing a response to that objection 
on june   dataquill limited filed suit against handspring and kyocera wireless corp 
in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois 
the complaint alleges infringement of one us patent 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and treble damages and to permanently enjoin the defendants from infringing the patent in the future 
we filed an answer on august   denying dataquill s allegations and asserting counterclaims for declaratory judgments that we do not infringe the 
table of contents patent in suit  that the patent in suit is invalid  and that it is unenforceable 
handspring has filed motions for summary judgment and expects a ruling shortly 
the case against the other defendant  kyocera wireless corp  has been severed and transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of california  where it pends separately 
on september   research in motion filed suit against handspring in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint alleges infringement of one us patent 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and treble damages and to permanently enjoin handspring from infringing the patents in the future 
handspring has not yet filed an answer to the complaint 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
we sell our products in asia pacific  canada  europe and the middle east in addition to the united states 
we expect to enter additional international markets over time 
if our revenue from international operations increases as a percentage of our total revenue  we will be subject to increased exposure to international risks 
in addition  the facilities where our products are and will be manufactured are located outside the united states 
a substantial number of our material suppliers also are based outside of the united states and are subject to a wide variety of international risks 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  development risks and expenses associated with customizing our product for local languages  difficulty in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  less effective protection of intellectual property  and changes in a specific country or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and we could fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
we expect to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or services offerings  technologies or industry expertise 
integration of acquired companies may result in problems relating to integrating technology and management teams 
management s attention may also be diverted away from other business issues and opportunities while focusing on the acquisitions 
if we fail to integrate the operations  personnel or products that we may acquire in the future  our business could be materially harmed 
the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly given that securities of technology related companies are typically volatile and only a small portion of our outstanding shares currently are publicly traded 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly variations in our operating results  including the level of sales during the holiday season  the timing and success of the introduction of our treo line of products  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  
table of contents reactions to events that affect other companies in our industry  particularly palm  even if these events do not directly affect us  actions by institutional stockholders  negative developments in the market for technology related stock or the stock market in general  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
we have been named as a party in several purported securities class action lawsuits that claim that the prospectus for handspring s june  initial public offering failed to disclose certain alleged actions by the underwriters for the offering 
we have sought indemnification from the underwriters pursuant to the underwriting agreement that we entered into with them in connection with our initial public offering 
communications we made to an investor could subject us to claims for return to the investor of the purchase price it paid us for the shares purchased 
in november  we provided a written communication to qualcomm incorporated  which subsequently agreed to purchase  shares of common stock from us at a price of per share 
it is possible that the communication might be deemed to be a prospectus that did not meet the requirements of the securities act and was therefore made in violation of the securities act 
if this communication were determined to violate the securities act  then for a period of one year after the date qualcomm discovered this violation  qualcomm might bring a claim against us 
in any action of this kind  qualcomm might seek recovery of the funds it paid for its shares or  if it had already sold its shares  damages resulting from its purchase and sales of those shares 
we would contest any such claim vigorously 
provisions in our charter documents might deter a company from acquiring us 
we have a classified board of directors 
our stockholders are unable to call special meetings of stockholders  to act by written consent  or to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote or to fill any vacancy on the board of directors 
our stockholders must also meet advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our board of directors may also issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders 
these provisions and other provisions under delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 
our executive officers  our directors and entities affiliated with them together beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders are able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control that may be viewed as beneficial by other stockholders 
future sales of shares by existing stockholders could affect our stock price 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
many of the shares eligible for sale in the public market are held by directors  executive officers and other affiliates and are subject to volume limitations under rule of the securities act of and various vesting agreements 
in addition  shares subject to outstanding options and shares reserved for future issuance under our stock option and purchase plans will continue to become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and the securities rules and regulations applicable to these shares 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a portfolio of short term and long term investments consisting mainly of fixed income securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities may fall in value if interest rates rise and if liquidated prior to their maturity dates 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we do not anticipate our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by any increase in market interest rates 
we do not hedge interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
revenue and expenses of our international operations are denominated in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have in the past entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the underlying transactions exposure and  consequently  for hedged exposures  a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates is not expected to have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to these financial instruments  but do not expect any counter party to fail to meet its obligation
