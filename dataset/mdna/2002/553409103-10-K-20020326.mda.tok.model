if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles would be based on the fair value of the asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of the company s market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term and long term debt obligations and to the company s investments 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  government securities  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities  when acquired  of days or less 
the company is adverse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
the company constantly evaluates its invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s short term and long term debt obligations totaled million as of december   and the company had million available under its credit facilities 
the short term debt obligations include million of notes payable to former shareholders of acquired corporations  which are at a fixed rate of interest 
the interest rate risk on these notes payable to former shareholders is immaterial due to the dollar amount of these obligations 
on february   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert certain floating rate debt outstanding under the company s credit facility into fixed rate debt by fixing the base rate  as defined by the credit facility 
the actual interest rate on the credit facility is equal to this base rate plus an additional spread  determined by the company s financial performance 
this swap agreement had an initial notional amount of million as of february   which amortizes to million on january  in correlation with the company s estimate of cash flow needs 
on march   the company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement to convert an additional million into fixed rate debt 
these agreements were approved by the board of directors 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled the interest rate swap agreement entered into on march  for a million loss 
as of december   the outstanding agreement had a total notional amount of million  with an underlying rate of 
hedging interest rate exposure through the use of swaps are specifically contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management policy 
the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes 
these swaps are transaction specific so that a specific debt instrument determines the amount  maturity and specifics of each swap 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its borrowings under the credit facility and its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations and cash flows  and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a basis point adverse change in interest rates on all borrowings under the credit facility and financial instruments  representing approximately of the company s weighted average borrowing rate 
however  the interest rate analysis did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
a basis point adverse move in interest rates on the company s outstanding borrowings under the credit facility would have an immaterial impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
however  a basis point adverse move in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreement by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate changes impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the company generated approximately of its consolidated revenues from international operations  approximately of which were from the united kingdom 
the exchange rate has decreased approximately in  from at december  to at december  the company prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the adverse impact of hypothetical changes in the british pound sterling  relative to the us dollar  on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels resulting from a change in the british pound sterling 
an additional adverse movement in the exchange rate would have had an immaterial impact on the company s cash flows and financial position for while fluctuations in the british pound sterling have not historically had a material impact on the company s results of operations  the lower level of earnings resulting from a decrease in demand for the services provided by the company s domestic operations have increased the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the company did not hold or enter into any foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  factors which may impact future results and financial condition effect of fluctuations in the general economy demand for the company s business services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity in the markets served by the company 
during periods of slowing economic activity  companies may reduce the use of outside consultants and staff augmentation services prior to undertaking layoffs of full time employees 
also during such periods  companies may elect to defer installation of new it systems and platforms such as enterprise resource planning systems or upgrades to existing systems and platforms 
as a result  any significant or continued economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company may also be adversely affected by consolidations through mergers and otherwise of major customers or between major customers with non customers 
these consolidations as well as corporate downsizings may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by such customers for the company s services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
competition the company s industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
the company faces significant competition in the markets that it serves and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market in which the company operates  it competes for both clients and qualified professionals with other firms offering similar services 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment and higher wage costs  which puts pressure on gross margins 
ability to recruit and retain professional employees the company depends on its ability to recruit and retain employees who possess the skills  experience and or professional certifications necessary to meet the requirements of the company s clients 
competition for individuals possessing the requisite criteria is intense  particularly in certain specialized it and professional skill areas 
the company often competes with its own clients in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will be available and recruited in sufficient numbers on economic terms acceptable to the company 
ability to continue acquisition strategy  ability to integrate acquired operations historically  the company has included acquisitions are a part of the company s overall growth strategy 
although the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acquisitions on economic terms acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and integrate all acquired operations into the company 
possible changes in governmental regulations from time to time  legislation is proposed in the united states congress  state legislative bodies and by foreign governments that would have the effect of requiring employers to provide the same or similar employee benefits to consultants and other temporary personnel as those provided to full time employees 
the enactment of such legislation would eliminate one of the key economic reasons for outsourcing certain human resources and could significantly adversely impact the company s staff augmentation business 
in addition  the company s costs could increase as a result of future laws or regulations that address insurance  benefits or other employment related matters 
there can be no assurance that the company could successfully pass any such increased costs to its clients 
financial covenants the company s credit facility requires that specified financial ratios be maintained 
the company s ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control 
failure to meet those financial ratios could allow its lenders to terminate the credit facility and to declare all amounts outstanding under those facilities to be immediately due and payable 
further  the company may not be able to obtain a replacement credit facility on terms and conditions or at interest rates as favorable as those in current agreements 
income tax audits the company is subject to periodic review by federal  state  and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business 
during  the company was notified by the internal revenue service that certain prior year income tax returns will be examined 
as part of this examination  the net tax benefit associated with an investment in a subsidiary that the company recognized in of million is also being reviewed 
there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service will not disallow any or all of the tax benefit 
a disallowance would result in the company having to repay any or all of the tax benefit to the internal revenue service which may affect the company s financial condition and financial covenants
