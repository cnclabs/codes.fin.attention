item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil  gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and electricity generated and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices will be predominantly influenced by world supply and demand 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the cost of natural gas used in the company s steaming operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations the company earned million  or per share  in  down from million  or per share  in  but up from million  or 
per share in income earned in represents the second highest income ever achieved by the company  exceeded only by the million earned in the decrease in income from was primarily related to lower crude oil prices and lower production which was a direct result of the suspension of steam operations in due to the california energy crisis and the writedown of electricity receivables from two of california s insolvent public utilities 
the following table presents certain operating data for the years ended december   and oil and gas net production boe d    per boe average sales price operating costs production taxes

boe d barrels of oil equivalent per day operating income from oil and gas producing operations was million in  down from million in  but up from million in the decrease from was primarily due to lower sales of oil and gas and higher dd a  partially offset by lower operating costs 
sales of oil and gas were million in  down from million in  but higher than million in the decrease from was related to both lower production and sales prices and the increase from was due to higher oil prices partially offset by slightly lower production 
production in at  boe d was and lower than  in and  in  respectively 
production for peaked at approximately  boe d in the first quarter before the effects of the suspension of steaming operations took effect 
the extremely high natural gas costs during the california energy crisis and the suspension of utility payments for cogeneration power made steaming uneconomic for several months in the first half of the company was forced to curtail conventional steaming operations in late and suspend the majority of its cogeneration operations in february with the remaining turbine shut in in early april 
in june  the company began increasing its steaming activities  with normal injection levels re established in august 
due to the steam curtailment  crude oil production fell to a low of approximately  boe d before recovering to a level of approximately  boe d at year end 
the company expects crude oil production levels to average approximately  boe d 
oil prices for were quite strong until the aftermath of september reduced worldwide demand for crude oil and refined products 
the average price received boe in of was only slightly lower than in and was higher than received in post september  crude oil prices fell bbl to a low of for california heavy oil but subsequently rebounded to bbl at year end and to as of february  operating costs per barrel in were  down from in  but higher than in the most significant factor in the reduction of operating costs from was the suspension of steaming operations 
not only was the cost of gas dramatically reduced  but other factors in the company s cost structure  such as production rig cost  chemicals for water treating and other areas were greatly diminished or eliminated for the period in which steaming was suspended 
although the suspension was a positive factor in lowering operating costs in  it did  of course  come at the cost of declining production levels 
other factors contributing to the decline in operating costs were the d project performed on the company s midway sunset properties in  higher environmental remediation costs in and savings from facility consolidation projects on several of the company s core properties in it should be pointed out that in the period of suspended cogeneration operations  it was necessary to purchase additional electricity from two california utilities at very high per unit costs which resulted in an increase in power costs of approximately million over levels 
the company estimates that the operating cost per barrel in will average to given the current development plan and operating environment 
the company has seen a drastic decline in electricity prices during although the average price received for the company s power was comparable at 
kwh for both and  the trend in electricity pricing is toward much lower prices which had a negative impact on the company s steam costs in the fourth quarter of and will also affect costs and beyond 
although the company has negotiated electricity sales contracts on its two placerita turbines at attractive prices  the remaining electricity generated is sold on the open market which currently has been priced at just 
kwh 
as the company entered  the california energy crisis was just unfolding 
two of the state s major utilities were experiencing extreme cash flow problems related to their inability to pass their cost to obtain electricity to retail and industrial customers 
therefore  in the early portion of  these two utilities suspended payment for electric power produced by the company under longstanding standard offer contracts 
the company was forced to take actions to protect the liquidity of the company 
prior to pacific gas and electric company s pg e bankruptcy  the company terminated its power purchase contracts with pg e 
the bankruptcy court confirmed these terminations and berry paid 
million pursuant to the settlement and stipulation with pg e 
in june  the company entered into a contract with a creditworthy power marketer and re established power production from its homebase cogeneration capacity 
in september  the company assigned its past due receivables for approximately of the balance owed by pg e which effectively ended the company s direct involvement with pg e s default 
the company filed litigation against edison and the california independent system operator iso on may and may  to recover non payment for deliveries of electricity from november through march and to resolve other contractual matters 
the lawsuits were ultimately coordinated with those of other qualified facilities and  on june   the company and edison entered into amendments with respect to its existing power purchase agreements which became effective on july  the amendments provided for a standstill of litigation and other matters 
on august   the company entered into implementing agreements concerning these amendments requiring the suspension of legal proceedings during the agreed to standstill period 
the above agreements were approved by the court on september  one of the two agreements will expire under its own terms in may  at which time the company will need to make other arrangements for the sale of the corresponding electricity production 
the standstill period was extended by a further amendment on december  and a payment formula was established whereby edison was to make payments  although there was no date identified 
additionally  edison was required to make monthly payments in advance for power to be delivered and to make interest payments on the outstanding balance until the balance is paid or the amendments terminate 
on march   edison paid the company million  representing the total past due amount plus interest 
the company will record pre tax income of million in the first quarter of related to this cash receipt 
at year end the company had no commodity hedges in place 
in december  the company terminated its crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts with enron and recognized a net pre tax loss on termination of these contracts of million 
the company anticipates that it will enter into similar gas purchase hedges in the near future in an effort to manage its spark spread the difference between the price received for the sale of electricity and the cost of natural gas and lower its operating costs 
dd a on a per barrel basis increased to  up from in and in the increase from prior years was primarily due to a higher depreciable basis resulting from the and development activity and facility improvements at the company s cogeneration facilities and the amortization of the remaining capitalized costs related to the standard offer electricity sales contracts which were terminated in the company expects dd a to be slightly lower in compared to general g a expenses in were million  or per boe  down from million in  but up from million in the decrease from was primarily the result of lower personnel costs  legal expenses and consulting charges 
the company expects similar g a expenses in compared to interest expense increased in to million from million in  but decreased from million in to ensure liquidity  the company drew down million from its credit facility in early to compensate for the large unpaid receivables from electricity sales in late and the early months of the receivable for one of the two utilities was sold in the third quarter eliminating approximately half of the remaining receivable balance 
these funds and internally generated funds were sufficient to pay off the million drawdown by the end of the third quarter of the debt repayment along with much lower interest rates has resulted in lower interest costs incurred thus far in compared to the average rate experienced in the company experienced an effective income tax rate of in  down from and in and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate is primarily a result of significant enhanced oil recovery eor tax credits earned by the company s continued investment in the development of its thermal eor projects  both through capital expenditures and continued steam injection volumes 
this is the fourth consecutive year that the company has achieved an effective tax rate below  versus the combined federal and state statutory rate of 
the company believes it will continue to earn significant eor tax credits and have an effective tax rate below in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  up from million at december   but down from million in net cash provided by operations was million  down from the all time record of million achieved in  but higher than million in the company used these funds to pay for capital expenditures of million  pay dividends of million  acquire an interest in producing properties and drillable acreage of million and increase the company s cash balance by million to a healthy balance of million at december  the company s net debt ie  its outstanding long term debt of million less working capital was million 
the company has a million revolving bank facility with a banking group 
as of december   approximately million is available under the agreement after deducting the million long term debt and million in outstanding letters of credit 
as of june   the company was owed million by edison for power produced between november and march in the third quarter of  million of the total was received  leaving a remaining balance of million as of december  of this balance  million was recorded as collectible receivables at december  on march   edison paid the company million  representing the total amount due plus interest 
the company presently intends to use these funds to reduce its long term debt of million to approximately million 
in august  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase million of common stock in the open market 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares for approximately million 
all shares repurchased were retired 
the company has budgeted million in capital projects in consisting of the drilling of company operated wells on its core california properties  of which will be horizontal  and non operated gross wells in the south joe creek field in wyoming 
the development program will also include remedial jobs and other facility improvements of million all at the company s core california properties 
at year end  the company had no subsidiaries  no special purpose entities and no off balance sheet debt 
the company did not enter into any significant related party transactions in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies  accounting for oil and gas reserves  environmental liabilities  income taxes and asset retirement obligations 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas in which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants and are used to calculate dd a and determine if any potential impairment exists related to the recorded value of the company s oil and gas properties 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its estimates of costs of compliance with environmental laws and the cleanup of various sites  including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party 
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of compliance or remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
the company makes certain estimates  which may include various tax planning strategies  in determining taxable income  the timing of deductions and the utilization of tax attributes 
management is required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations on the future abandonment cost  net of salvage value  of its oil and gas properties and equipment 
the company reviews its estimate of the future obligation periodically and accrues the estimated obligation monthly based on the units of production method 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has significant market risk exposure related to the prices received for the sale of its crude oil 
a change in oil price will equate to an approximately million change in annual revenues 
the company periodically enters into hedge contracts to manage the oil price risk 
the company had no crude oil hedges in place at december  however  the company has entered into oil price protection hedges in for a one year period beginning april  on a total of  bpd 
based on wti pricing  the hedges have a floor of approximately bbl and a ceiling of approximately bbl 
the company is also at risk for a widening of the differential between the wti crude oil price and the posted price of the company s heavy crude oil 
to minimize this risk  the company has a sales contract in place through march  for over of its crude oil production which is priced at the higher of local field posting plus a bonus  wti minus a fixed differential or a fixed percentage of wti 
the company also has market risk exposure related to the price received for the sale of its electricity production and the cost paid by the company for the natural gas used in its cogeneration operations 
the company s three cogeneration facilities  when combined  have electricity production capacity of mw of electricity hour mwh 
of this total  the company sells approximately mwh and the remaining mwh is consumed in the company s operations 
the company s goal is to control its spark spread the difference between the sales price received for its electricity and the cost to purchase natural gas used as fuel in the cogeneration operations 
this was an extremely difficult goal to achieve during primarily due our early electrical contract terminations arising out of the utility purchasers default and the volatility in the electrical market and in natural gas prices 
the company consumes approximately  mmbtu day of natural gas as fuel in these facilities 
a change of 
mmbtu in the cost of natural gas equates to a change of approximately million in operating costs 
the company has a long term electricity sales contract in place at a fixed price of mwh plus capacity on approximately mwh of electricity production with a major utility 
a change of mwh in the price received for electricity on the remaining mwh equates to approximately 
million in annual revenues 
the company is a party to another electricity sales contract for approximately mwh that is based on a short run avoided cost srac pricing mechanism 
this provides the company an electricity price that is directly related to the cost of natural gas 
however  this contract terminates in may  whereupon this volume may be sold on the open market 
the remainder of the electricity is sold primarily on the open market to a creditworthy customer 
as the electricity market stabilizes in california  the company anticipates entering into longer term sales contracts for its electricity 
the company was able to enter into a four month sales contract through june  under which the company will deliver mwh of electricity  plus a cash payment  in exchange for a sufficient volume of natural gas needed to generate the mwh of electricity to fulfill the contract  thereby protecting the spark spread on this volume 
the company is pursuing longer term arrangements on the sale of its electricity and may enter into additional hedges on its natural gas purchases to seek to improve the spark spread related to these non utility volumes 
forward looking statements safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include  but are not limited to  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil  gas and electricity  gas transportation availability  the non existence of a liquid marketplace for electricity purchases and sales within california  competition  environmental risks  litigation uncertainties  drilling  development and operating risks  uncertainties about the estimates of reserves  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services  legislative  california public utilities commission  federal energy regulatory commission  and or judicial decisions and other government regulations
