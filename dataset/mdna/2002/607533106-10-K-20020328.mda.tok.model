in june  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of a builder and marketer of e businesses in tokyo  japan for million in cash

in october  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of mex multimedia experts gmbh  a developer of interactive business solutions in munich  germany  for million  which was comprised of million in cash and million of our common stock

the vivid acquisition resulted in million of goodwill 
late in the fourth quarter of  and continuing into the first quarter of  the vivid business weakened significantly  leading us to conclude that the remaining value inherent in the vivid goodwill could not be realized 
specifically  the number of vivid employees employed by the company continued to decrease  new assignments that would utilize the skills of the remaining vivid employees were not secured and market conditions impacted the ability of internet start ups to utilize our services 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result  our goodwill amortization in was million as compared to million in in march  we purchased of the outstanding capital stock of our affiliate in sao paulo  brazil from true north for  in cash

factors affecting operating results our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  including the scope and timing of new assignments and client initiatives  the spending levels and budget constraints of our clients  our dependence on a limited number of clients  our effectiveness in attracting and retaining qualified staff  including management  our ability to accurately estimate costs in fixed fee engagements  exclusivity arrangements with clients that may limit our ability to provide services to others and other factors that are outside of our control

our long term capital needs depend on numerous factors  including the rate at which we are able to obtain new business from clients and expand our staff and infrastructure  as needed  to accommodate growth  as well as the rate at which we choose to invest in new technologies

recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides guidance on classification and accounting for such assets when held for sale or abandonment 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this pronouncement on january  and do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  unless impairment indicators arise sooner 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply immediately to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after june  goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on or prior to such date will be accounted for under sfas no 
by us beginning on january  we are in the process of performing the required fair value impairment test on our goodwill as of january  we recorded million  or per share  of goodwill amortization in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we will no longer record goodwill amortization 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued a staff announcement topic d topic d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
topic d establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be reported as revenue in the statement of operations 
currently  we classify reimbursed out of pocket expenses as a reduction of operating expenses 
we have adopted this guidance effective in the first quarter of fiscal our adoption of topic d will result in increased revenue and increased costs of revenue 
our results of operations for prior periods will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
we are currently in the process of determining the impact on our revenue and cost of revenue of such prior periods 
our adoption of topic d will not affect our net income or loss in any past or future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
in  we derived of our revenues from operations outside of the us we face foreign currency risks primarily as a result of the revenues that we receive from services delivered through our foreign subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily with respect to the british pound  euro  and canadian dollar  as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact net income loss and operating performance 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation for the year ended december  was not material 
currently  we do not hedge foreign currency transactions into us dollars because we believe that  over time  the cost of a hedging program will outweigh any benefit of greater predictability in our us dollar denominated results 
however  we will  from time to time  reconsider the issue of whether a foreign currency hedging program would be beneficial to our operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
a rise in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the fair value of fixed rate securities and  conversely  if interest rates fall  floating rate securities may generate less income 
we limited our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of one year or less 
effective january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common currency on january  on january   euro denominated currency was issued  and on june   all national currencies of the participating countries will cease to be legal tender 
our european operations are most significantly concentrated in the united kingdom  which  despite being a member of the european union  is not participating in the single currency at this time 
while we are in the process of making certain adjustments to our business and operations to accommodate the euro conversion  we do not believe  based on information available at this time  that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations
