the note balance is net of warrants valued at million less thousand amortized as interest expense through june  in march  the company entered into an million senior secured credit facility with a consortium of four banks 
as of june   this facility includes up to million of revolving credit revolving credit  a term loan with a balance of million term loan and an acquisition facility with a balance of million acquisition facility

these facilities mature in march the outstanding principal on the term loan is scheduled to be paid in full by march  the outstanding principal on both the revolving credit and acquisition facility are 
table of contents due in march interest rates may vary depending upon the company s leverage ratio 
currently the interest rate is equal to the libor rate plus or the banks base rate which was as of june  
both the senior secured credit facility and the note contain covenants that  among other things  limit senior indebtedness  place restrictions on the disposition of assets  limit unfunded capital expenditures as well as tests for interest coverage  leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage  debt service  minimum quarterly earnings and various cash flow targets 
for the period ended june   the company complied with all debt covenant requirements with the exception of the limits on unfunded capital expenditures and meeting the minimum quarterly earnings for the nd and rd quarters of fy the company is in discussions with its lenders associated with the senior secured credit facility and the note to obtain waivers for these debt covenants 
as the covenant waivers have not been finalized  the total principal outstanding associated with the senior secured credit facility and the note have been classified on the company s consolidated balance sheet as current portion of long term debt and senior subordinated notes  current 
until such time as the waivers are agreed to and executed  the lenders have the right to declare the outstanding obligations associated with the senior secured credit facility and the note as immediately due and payable 
neither party has exercised this right 
in addition to the continuing discussions to obtain covenant waivers  the company has contracted with a financial advisor and is in discussions with other lenders to provide new financing to replace the senior secured credit facility and the note 
there can be no assurance that the company could obtain the financing necessary  which may result in the company having inadequate financial resources to meet this obligation should the lenders exercise their right to accelerate the maturity dates 
however  the company believes it will be able to secure new financing to replace the senior secured credit facility and the note if the lenders exercise their right to accelerate the maturity dates 
the company generally purchases fuel using credit terms which on average are shorter than the credit terms the company offers its fuel customers 
as a result  the company requires access to sufficient credit facilities which may need to increase in the future as the company expands its business 
the amount of working capital consumed by the company has depended and is expected to depend primarily on the quantity and the price of fuel bought and sold  the company s extension of credit to its customers  customers compliance with the company s credit terms and the credit terms extended to the company by its suppliers 
any increase in the quantity and or price of fuel sold or in credit terms extended to its customers and or any reduction in credit terms extended to the company by its suppliers and or any substantial customer noncompliance with the company s credit terms can result in a corresponding increase in the company s working capital requirements 
under these circumstances  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected unless the company is able to increase vendor credit or increase lending limits under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company believes  however  that its current financing arrangements and vendor credit terms should provide the company with sufficient liquidity in the event of a temporary surge in fuel oil prices 
however  to the extent that the revolving credit facility or any other credit facility is used to fund increased working capital requirements  the company will incur additional debt service costs 
the company s accounts receivable balance as of june  was million 
the company s accounts receivable are primarily comprised of customer trade receivables net of accumulated allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the company s credit risk is based in part on the following factors a substantial portion of the customer trade receivables are related to a single industry aviation and at any given point in time  one or several customers may owe a significant balance to the company 
the company s mercfuel operation accounted for approximately of the total company revenue in fiscal for the year ended june   sales to mercfuel customers make up approximately of the company s total accounts receivable due from what the company defines as smaller and generally less well established or well capitalized airlines  including certain foreign  regional  commuter and start up airlines  which may be less creditworthy than larger  well established and well capitalized airlines 
these customers are more affected by fluctuations in the economy in general and in the aviation industry specifically 
for example  a material rise in the price of aviation fuel tends to more adversely impact these types of customers 
to the extent that mercury s airline customers are not able to immediately adjust their business operations to reflect increased operating costs  they could take relatively longer to pay the company s accounts receivable 
such payment delays would further increase mercury s working capital demands 
in some cases  the impact of such economic fluctuations could materially impair the financial stability of an airline customer such that it would be unable to pay amounts owed to the company and could result in such airline customer filing for bankruptcy protection 
in that event  mercury could incur significant losses related to the uncollectability of the receivables 
mercury has incurred in the past and is likely to continue to incur losses as the result of the business failure of a customer 
mercury assesses its credit portfolio on an ongoing basis and establishes allowances which the company believes are adequate to absorb potential credit problems that can be reasonably anticipated 
this assessment includes an analysis of past due accounts as well as a review of accounts with significant balances 
allowances are established for all or some portion of past due balances based upon various factors including the extent of delinquency  financial conditions of delinquent customers and amounts of insurance and collateral  if any 

table of contents accounts receivable days outstanding were days and days as of june  and  respectively 
accounts receivable days outstanding have historically been impacted by a high volume of fuel sales to customers with extended payment terms 
however  during fiscal  the company added a large customer  airtran airways  whose terms are prepaid 
the terms of the prepayment provide for weekly payments equal to the following week s estimated sales 
this prepaid customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenue for each of the years ended june  and during the same periods  the company also reduced the maximum amount of available credit to national airlines based on their volume of fuel purchased 
these factors have contributed to a fairly stable receivable collection pattern 
the company s most recent recurring capital expenditure requirements have been related to the acquisition and maintenance of the company s air center facilities 
in april  the company acquired the assets of an fbo located in fort wayne  indiana for million in cash which was funded under its acquisition line 
in october  the company acquired assets of an fbo in tulsa  oklahoma for million in cash which was funded under its acquisition line 
a second part to this closing occurred in july for million which was also funded under the company s acquisition line 
in october  the company acquired certain fbo assets at charleston international airport and john s island executive airport in south carolina for  in cash funded under its acquisition line 
in september  the company acquired the birmingham  alabama fbo assets from raytheon aircraft services for million in cash  which was funded from its acquisition line 
in fiscal  the company completed construction of a new fbo facility in burbank  california at a cost of approximately of million  of which million was incurred during fiscal during fiscal  the company completed the construction of a hangar at the bedford air center at cost of approximately million  incurred primarily during fiscal years and this hangar was sold in conjunction with the sale of the bedford facility at the end of fiscal year 
the company spent approximately million for the construction of a new hangar at the jackson air center during the fiscal year 
other capital expenditure requirements include the purchase of refueling and ground handling equipment for both commercial and government contract services operations 
during fiscal and  respectively  the company spent approximately million and million to purchase refueling and ground handling equipment for this business segment 
absent a major prolonged surge in oil prices  currently unforeseen impact resulting from the events of september   or a capital intensive acquisition  the company believes its operating cash flow  senior credit facility  vendor credit and cash balance will provide it with sufficient liquidity during the next twelve months 
in the event that fuel prices increase significantly for an extended period of time  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected unless the company is able to increase vendor credit or increase lending limits under its revolving credit facility 
the company believes  however  its revolving credit and vendor credit should provide it with sufficient liquidity in the event of a major temporary surge in oil prices

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including the financial information reported in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent form other sources 
actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates 
the following represent what the company believes are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgements allowance for doubtful accounts the company continuously monitors collections and payments from our customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts receivables are reported net of the allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowances can be either specific to a particular customer or general to all customers 
the company believes the level of the allowance for bad debts is reasonable based on past experience and an analysis of the net realizable value of the company s trade receivables at june  however  the credit loss rate can be impacted by adverse changes in the aviation industry  or changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers which would affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results
