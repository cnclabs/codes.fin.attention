critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to  a revenue recognition  b allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  c accruals for employee benefits  restructuring and related costs  sales allowances  and taxes  and d useful lives and realizability of carrying values for property and equipment  computer software costs  other intangibles  and prepaid royalties 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the operating results for the fiscal year ending september  are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
phoenix licenses software under non cancelable license agreements and provides services including non recurring engineering efforts  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  and training 
generally  our products are incorporated into the products of our oem odm customers 
royalty revenues from oems odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated shipments made by the oems odms of products containing our software during the period 
since we generally receive quarterly royalty reports from our oems odms approximately to days following the end of the quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate the royalty revenues  including obtaining estimates of production from our oem odm customers  utilizing historical experience  and other relevant current information 
we accrued million of royalty revenues from our oem odm customers as of september  compared with million as of september  this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in overall pc shipments  especially in the japanese market 
although management believes that it has a reliable basis for making reasonable estimates  the actual results could differ depending on customer or market factors 
revenues from oems odms for initial  non refundable royalties relating to volume royalty license agreements are recorded when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recorded million of revenues from oem odm customers relating to volume royalty license agreements in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
these agreements were non refundable 
if there is a change in the customer s buying pattern in a future quarter  there could be a quarter in which revenue is lower from the customer 
allowance for sales and doubtful accounts 
we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
provision for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance for sales and doubtful accounts was million 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowances for sales and doubtful accounts which would impact revenue and expense  respectively  as appropriate 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include prepaid royalties  purchased technologies  goodwill and other intangibles 
at september  and  these assets totaled million and million  respectively 
prepaid royalties represent payments to several third party technology partners for their software that is incorporated into certain of our products 
all other intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets was estimated based on the period over which the assets were expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which became effective on july   goodwill arising from acquisitions subsequent to june  and any existing goodwill on october  are not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding sfas and accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill are based on third party appraisals 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we performed reviews and made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance 
when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  then we must perform quarterly assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve projected future taxable income in specific geographies 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we must record a tax expense in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax asset as of september  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of foreign tax and r d credits before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we cannot assure that we will not be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
if we increase the valuation allowance  it could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
business combinations in january  we acquired certain assets of a privately held company  storagesoft  inc storagesoft  for a total purchase price of million in cash and phoenix s common stock  pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement dated december  storagesoft is a developer of drive diagnostic utilities and hard drive imaging software that reduces the cost to own  deploy  and manage multiple pcs 
with the acquisition  we further expanded our next generation firstware product line and distribution channels in the generic pc or white box manufacturing and pc system builder markets 
during fiscal  we completed two business combinations 
in february  phoenix acquired integrity sciences  inc integrity sciences  a provider of core computer security products  which developed and marketed strong password technology for a purchase price of million in cash and phoenix common stock 
in march  phoenix acquired certain assets of ravisent technologies  inc ravisent technologies  a provider of digital audio and video software solutions and internet appliance technology for million in cash 
there were no acquisitions or business combinations during fiscal the acquisition agreement with integrity sciences includes an earn out agreement over a five year period of up to  shares of phoenix s common stock and cash payments of million  if certain revenues and technology criteria are met 
there is no minimum payment requirement in the earn out agreement 
no payments have been earned through september  the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses were included in the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and the results of operations from the date of acquisitions through september  and were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended september  and discontinued operations on september   we completed the sale of insilicon to synopsys 
under the terms of the cash tender offer agreement with synopsys  we tendered and sold  insilicon shares  or of our ownership interest in insilicon for per share 
included under the caption of discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations are loss from discontinued operations and gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in fiscal  loss from discontinued operations of million represents insilicon s net loss  net of tax provision of million  from the beginning of the period through july   the date we announced our agreement with synopsys to sell insilicon 
net gain on disposal of million includes a pretax gain of million  a tax provision of million  offset by insilicon s net loss of million  net of tax benefit of million  which was incurred during the phaseout period between july  and september  furthermore  the sale of insilicon generated net cash proceeds of million after transaction costs of million 
also  as a result of the sale  all prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect insilicon s financial results as discontinued operations

revenues by geographic region based on country of sale for fiscal   and were as follows in thousands amount of revenues change of revenues north america japan taiwan other asian countries europe total revenues total revenues in fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of the continued global economic slowdown and softness in the pc market  particularly in the notebook and desktop market 
in fiscal  north america  japan  and other asian countries revenues decreased while taiwan and europe revenues increased 
the decrease in japan and other asian countries was due primarily to the continued slowdown in the japan and korean pc markets and economic weakness in those regions

the increase in taiwan and europe was attributed to slight recovery in the local economies from north american revenues remained relatively flat from to in fiscal  revenues from north america  taiwan  japan and europe decreased while other asian countries increased 
the decrease was due primarily to the economic slowdown in the global economy which had a significant impact on the pc market 
the increase in other asian countries was attributed to improved sales development efforts in korea and china

stock based compensation the stock based compensation expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
charges in fiscal and were primarily due to the amortization of options granted to purchase stock at exercise prices less than the fair market value on the measurement date 
restructuring costs restructuring charges for fiscal   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
charges in october  we announced a restructuring program that identified and eliminated approximately positions across all business functions from its global workforce  including several senior management positions 
this restructuring program was to reduce our on going operating expense level 
this reduction resulted in a net charge of million  comprised of million of severance charges in the first quarter of fiscal and million credit in the fourth quarter of fiscal at september   all terminations were completed and million of the severance and outplacement expenses were paid and the remaining million is expected to be paid through the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the restructuring program announced in october  our estimated pretax savings were million on an annualized basis starting from the second quarter of fiscal charges in april  in efforts to optimize operational efficiency and change our business strategy to address changes in customer demands  we reduced our global workforce by approximately employees across all business functions

charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  phoenix recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance benefits associated with the elimination of three management positions 
the charges were related to the streamlining of certain management functions in taiwan and north america 
all terminations were completed as of september  interest and other income  net net interest and other income was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
net interest and other income consists mostly of interest income  which is primarily derived from cash and short term investments 
the income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in government interest rates 
the average interest rate earned in fiscal was approximately 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are in usd and are not subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest income was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
interest income decreased by million in both fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in both years was primarily due to lower yields from decreased interest rates and lower average cash and short term investment balance due to funding various acquisitions and stock repurchase programs during the year 
gain loss on investment gain loss on investment was million  million  and nil in fiscal   and  respectively 
equity investments in companies in which phoenix does not have significant influence  which is usually when ownership is less than  are included in other assets 
these investments are accounted for using the cost method 
these investments are assessed for impairment periodically through review of operations and indications of continued viability  such as subsequent rounds of financing 
in fiscal  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of our remaining equity investment 
during fiscal  as a result of the deterioration of financial markets and the corresponding effect on company valuations and financing prospects  phoenix recorded million in losses for other than temporary declines in the value of investments in these companies 
phoenix did not record any impairment charges in fiscal net loss on investment in fiscal was million  resulting from million of write down netted against million of gain on sale of investments 
provision for income taxes phoenix recorded an income tax benefit of million and income tax provisions of million and million  reflecting effective tax rates of   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in and differed from the expected benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory tax rate to the losses before taxes primarily due to the foreign withholding taxes 
the effective tax rate in differed from the expected tax provision derived by applying the us federal statutory tax rate to the income before taxes due to various federal and state tax credits and lower tax rates imposed on foreign earnings in certain jurisdictions 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  totaling million and million at september  and  respectively 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were million at september  and consolidated short term investment totaled million at september  we believe that current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements on a short term and long term basis 
stock repurchase program in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of phoenix s common stock over a twelve month period 
as of october   we repurchased approximately  shares of common stock at a cost of million under the fiscal repurchase program 
in february  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of outstanding shares of common stock over a month period 
in fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million under the repurchase program 
also  in the first quarter of fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million under the same repurchase program 
in fiscal  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock over a month period 
under this program  we repurchased approximately  shares during fiscal at a cost of million 
also  in first quarter of fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million under the repurchase program and completed the program 
commitments we have commitments under operating leases ranging from one to eight years for million 
we also entered into agreements to license third party software that would be incorporated into certain of our products and are committed to pay million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on september   our future commitments are as follows in thousands years ending september  and thereafter total commitments changes in financial condition we reported million consolidated cash and cash equivalent as of september  net cash generated from continuing operating activities during fiscal was million  consisting primarily of a decrease of million in accounts receivable  a million increase in income tax payable  a million increase in deferred revenue  a decrease of million in receivables from affiliates  and an inflow of million of net income adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by a million increase in prepaid royalties and other fluctuations in working capital

net cash used in continuing financing activities during fiscal was million  consisting of million of cash used to repurchase phoenix s common stock  offset by million generated from the exercise of common stock options and the issuance of stock under the phoenix s employee stock purchase plans 
business risks the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our business 
fluctuations in operating results the tables in part ii  item of this form k include selected unaudited quarterly consolidated data for fiscal and this information was derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present this information  when read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of our license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while we receive recurring revenues on royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  we experience a pattern of recording or more of our quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
we have historically monitored our revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews within the quarter 
these reviews keep management informed of areas where additional selling efforts may be needed in order to meet the internal plans and market expectations 
there can be no assurances that this process will result in our meeting revenue expectations 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are generally incurred ratably throughout the year 
as a result  if revenues were less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed  our operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
product development our long term success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products timely and cost effectively that meet the needs of customers in present and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that new or enhanced products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenues generated from the sale of such products 
we have  from time to time  experienced such delays 
our software products and their enhancements contain complex code that may contain undetected errors and or bugs when first introduced 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such new products or enhancements 
the introduction of new products in the short term will also depend on acceptance of our firstware applications and adoption of internet appliances 
dependence on new product releases by our customers our customers new product introduction schedule may influence our ability to successfully take our new applications to market 
many of our customers new products would typically include our new offerings 
these new devices play a critical role in increasing our core business average selling prices  as they offer added functionality  enhance additional sales of existing products  and enable other new product suites 
many of our customers current products were introduced prior to the release of our new application products 
due to continued economic downturn and market uncertainties  many customers have delayed their product introductions  specifically in the notebook and non pc segments 
if our customers continue to delay their product introductions  our ability to generate revenue from our new application products may be adversely affected 
unfavorable economic and market conditions adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the pc and information appliance industries and may continue to impact our business  resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of a decrease in capital spending by our customers  increased price competition for our products  partially as a consequence of price pressure in the pc markets  and delays in new product introduction and acceptance by our customers 
higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if they deteriorate further  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 
risks in acquisitions our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products  and introduce new products on a timely basis 
we have and will continue to address the need to develop new products through acquisitions of other companies and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs of in process research and development costs  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
we have not made acquisitions that result in in process research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter 
these charges may occur in future acquisitions in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 
entrance into new or developing markets as we focus on new market opportunities  we will increasingly compete with large  established suppliers as well as startup companies 
some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources  including technical and engineering resources  than we do 
additionally  as customers in these markets mature and expand  they may require greater levels of service and support than we have provided in the past 
we expect that demand for these types of service and support may increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that we can provide products  service  and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
further  provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 
litigation risks from time to time  we become involved in litigation claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy  and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see item  legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 
effective tax rates our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
protection of intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  trademark  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for our products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
as of september   we had been issued patents in the us and had patent applications in process in the united states patent and trademark office 
on a worldwide basis  we have been issued patents with respect to our current product offerings and have patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products we market 
we maintain an active internal program designed to identify internally developed inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the applications pending will be approved and patents issued or that our engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
also  as the number of software patents increases  we believe that companies that develop software products may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that our patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by us 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  may be time consuming and expensive to defend  can trigger indemnity obligations owed by us to third parties  and may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets  whether alleged against us  or our customers  and regardless of whether such claims have merit  could also have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  we have worked closely with leading software and semiconductor companies in developing standards for the pc industry 
we remain optimistic regarding relationships with these industry leaders 
however  there can be no assurance that leading software and semiconductor companies will not develop alternative product strategies that could conflict with our product plans and marketing strategies 
action by such companies may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in our product offerings  although these companies now incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in the bios 
these leading software and semiconductor companies  in their endeavors to add value  incorporate features or functions provided by us either in the silicon or in the operating system 
therefore  we must continuously create new features and functions to sustain  as well as increase  our software s added value to oems odms 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel our ability to achieve our revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain top tier engineering  sales  marketing  and administrative personnel 
security and internet products are based on new and emerging technologies that are different from bios technologies 
the available pool of engineering talent is limited for all lines of businesses despite the current economic downturn 
accordingly  failure to attract  retain and grow our talents could adversely affect our business and operating results 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
we might not be able to execute our business plan if we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel 
some of our executives and key employees joined us only recently and have had only a limited time to work together 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit risk the loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our customer base includes large oems in the pc  semiconductor and internet markets  system integrator value added resellers  and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we maintain individually significant receivable balances due from some of them

international sales and activities revenues derived from the international operations of our bios and firstbios product family comprise a majority of total revenues

statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business  companies with which we compete or relating to us specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities will have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are mostly denominated in us dollars 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the impact from a hypothetical percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial on our net income
