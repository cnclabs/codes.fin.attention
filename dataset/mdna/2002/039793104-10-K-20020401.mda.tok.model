item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that owns  manages  leases  develops  renovates and acquires commercial properties located in southern california 
we are a full service real estate organization managed by senior executive officers who have experience in the real estate industry ranging from to years and who collectively have an average of years experience 
we perform all property management  construction management  accounting  finance and acquisition activities and a majority of our leasing transactions with our staff of approximately employees 
as of december   we are southern california s largest publicly traded office landlord as measured by total net rentable square feet owned 
as of that date  our portfolio consisted of primarily suburban office properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet and two properties with approximately  net rentable square feet under development 
as of december   our properties were occupied 
our primary business strategy is to actively manage our portfolio to achieve gains in rental rates and occupancy  control operating expenses and to maximize income from ancillary operations and services 
when market conditions permit  we may also selectively develop or acquire new properties that add value and fit strategically into our portfolio 
we may also sell existing properties and redeploy the proceeds into investments that we believe will generate higher long term value 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition minimum rent  including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases  is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
qualification as a reit since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions subject to interpretation 
if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
for additional information see risk factors we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit  and our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify  elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents depreciation depreciation is calculated under the straight line method using depreciable lives of ten to forty seven years for building and building improvements and five year lives for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
amortization of tenant improvements is calculated using the straight line method over the term of the related lease 
the carrying amount of all properties is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the useful life is warranted 
during  the useful lives of certain building and building improvements were adjusted to more accurately reflect their estimated usefulness 
the effect of this change in estimate in was an increase to net income of approximately million or per common share 
this change in estimate did not have an impact on our cash flows or funds from operations 

table of contents results of operations our financial position and operating results are primarily comprised of our portfolio of properties and income derived from those properties 
therefore  the comparability of financial data from period to period will be affected by the timing of significant property renovations  development  acquisitions and dispositions

table of contents variances for revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses the increase in revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses in as compared to was partially due to a development property placed in service in  one development project placed in service in  a property sold in  five properties sold in  and three properties under renovation for all or a portion of the periods presented 
operating results for properties under renovation may significantly vary from period to period depending on the status of the renovation and occupancy levels maintained during the renovation 
following is a summary of the increase in revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses that relates to the eleven properties that were either sold  placed in service after january  or were under renovation for all or a portion of the period beginning after january  and for the non renovation non development properties we owned for all and in thousands  except number of properties

revenue from rental operations for these properties  computed on a gaap basis  increased by approximately million  or  during as compared to approximately million of this difference was related to higher rental revenue in the increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to increases in rental rates in revenue from rental operations was also higher due to an approximate million increase in tenant reimbursements and an approximate million increase in parking income offset by an approximate million decrease in revenue from other rental operations 
tenant reimbursements increased primarily due to higher operating expenses in  as discussed below 
parking income increased in primarily due to increases in parking rates  while revenue from other rental operations decreased due to the timing of revenues from non scheduled sources 
revenue from other rental operations includes after hour utility billings  signage and lease termination settlements 
straight line rents for these properties in were approximately  less than in property expenses for these properties increased by approximately million  or  during as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in utility expenses  a million increase in real estate taxes  a million increase in insurance expense and a million increase in administrative expenses in the increase in utility expenses was primarily due to rate increases in real estate taxes increased in due to normal annual increases and final assessments on certain properties 
insurance expense increased due to increases in industry wide insurance rates in  while administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel costs in as noted above  the increase in operating expenses was the primary reason for the million increase in tenant reimbursements

year ended december  dollar percent change change gaap basis revenue from rental operations property expenses cash basis revenue from rental operations property expenses number of properties average occupancy net rentable square feet excludes straight line rent adjustments 
revenue from rental operations for these properties  computed on a gaap basis  increased by approximately million  or  during  compared to approximately million of this increase was from rental revenue  of which million was related to scheduled rents and million was from straight line rent 
approximately of the increase in scheduled rents was due to increases in rental rates in and the remaining was related to higher average occupancy in the increase in straight line rent was primarily due to new leases and extensions signed with higher rental rate escalations than in revenue from rental operations was also higher due to an approximate million increase in tenant reimbursements  a million increase in parking income net of an approximate million decrease in other revenue from rental operations 
in addition to recoveries of approximately  from increases in utility rates for our san diego properties  tenant reimbursements and parking income primarily increased due to the approximate increase in average occupancy in  while other rental operations decreased primarily due to lower lease termination settlement fees in excluding only the straight line rent adjustment for these properties  revenue from rental operations computed on a cash basis  increased by approximately million or 
property operating expenses for these properties increased by approximately million  or  during  compared to  primarily due to higher real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  contingent ground rent and property administrative expenses in real estate taxes increased by approximately million in due to normal annual increases and final assessments on certain properties 
repairs and maintenance increased by  primarily due to the increase in average occupancy in ground rent expense increased by  due to higher operating income from one of our properties with a participating ground lease 
property administrative expenses  comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  were approximately  higher in  primarily due to our continued focus on raising our portfolio wide occupancy 
utility costs increased by approximately  in due to both higher average occupancy and rate increases for our san diego properties  partially offset by savings achieved from energy enhancing capital improvements completed during 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to improved operating results for the properties we owned for both years presented and from cash flows for four development renovation properties placed in service subsequent to january  this increase was partially offset by the loss of operating cash flows on a property we sold in the fourth quarter of and ten properties sold in cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million to million in  as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the completion of several of our development and renovation projects during which resulted in an approximate million reduction in cash used in our development and renovation projects in in addition  proceeds from property sales were approximately million higher in cash used in financing activities decreased by million to an outflow of million in  as compared to an inflow of million in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of repayments of mortgage loans  net paydowns of our unsecured lines of credit and distributions to our stockholders  which were partially offset by the net proceeds from an offering of unsecured senior notes 
capital commitments as of december   we had approximately million outstanding in capital commitments related to tenant improvements  development and property related capital expenditures 
we expect to fund short term capital commitments through cash flow generated by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales or proceeds from our lines of credit 
available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources we have an unsecured line of credit with a group of banks led by wells fargo 
this line of credit provides for borrowings up to million with an option to increase the amount to million and bears interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus including an annual facility fee ranging from 
to 
based on the aggregate amount of the facility  depending on our unsecured debt rating 
in addition  as long as we maintain an unsecured debt rating of bbb baa or better  the agreement contains a competitive bid option  whereby the lenders on this line of credit may bid on the interest rate to be charged for up to million of the unsecured line of credit 
under certain circumstances  we also have the option to convert the interest rate on this line of credit to the greater of the federal funds rate plus or wells fargo s prime rate 
this line of credit matures in april as of december   there was approximately million outstanding on this line of credit and approximately million was available for additional borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured line of credit with lehman brothers 
borrowings on this line of credit bear interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus  depending on our unsecured debt rating 
we also have the option to convert the interest rate to the prime rate plus 
this line of credit matures in july with an option to extend the maturity date for one year 
as of december   there was million outstanding on this line of credit 
we also have an unsecured line of credit with a total commitment of million from city national bank 
this line of credit accrues interest at the city national bank prime rate less and is scheduled to mature on august  proceeds from this line of credit are used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and provide for working capital and other corporate purposes 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit and million was available for additional borrowings 

table of contents on may   we sold an approximate  square foot office property located in irvine  california for approximately million 
on that date  we also sold an approximate  square foot industrial property located in ontario  california for approximately million 
on september   we sold an approximate  square foot office property located in simi valley  california for approximately million and an approximate  square foot office property located in riverside  california for approximately million 
on november   we sold an approximate  square foot office property located thousand oaks  california for approximately million and on december   we sold an approximate  square foot portfolio of three office properties and two industrial properties located in temecula  california for approximately million 
the net proceeds from these dispositions were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our wells fargo unsecured line of credit 
on june   we and our operating partnership filed a form s shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  providing for the issuance of up to million of debt securities by the operating partnership and up to million of our 
par value common stock or our 
par value preferred stock 
the terms of these securities will be determined at the time of any debt or equity offering 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on july  on november   our operating partnership completed a public offering of million  unsecured notes due  from the shelf registration statement  with interest payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our wells fargo unsecured line of credit 
following is a summary of scheduled principal payments for our total outstanding indebtedness as of december  in thousands year amount thereafter total primarily consists of million outstanding on our lehman brothers line of credit which has a one year extension 
primarily consists of million outstanding on our wells fargo line of credit 
the following is other information related to our indebtedness as of december  in thousands  except percentage and interest rate data unsecured and secured debt percent of weighted average balance total debt interest rate unsecured debt secured debt total weighted average 
table of contents floating and fixed rate debt percent of weighted average balance total debt interest rate floating rate fixed rate total weighted average includes amortization of prepaid financing costs 
total interest incurred and the amount capitalized was as follows unaudited and in thousands for the years ended december  total interest incurred amount capitalized amount expensed as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash 
restricted cash includes million in interest bearing cash deposits required by some of our mortgage loans payable 
included in cash and cash equivalents was million in short term investments and million in cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by several of our mortgage loans payable 
we may sell assets over the next twelve to twenty four months 
due to market conditions beyond our control  it is difficult to predict the actual period and amount of these asset sales 
also depending on market conditions  at the time any such sales proceeds are realized  we expect to redeploy such amounts into investments that we believe will generate higher long term value  which may include development of office buildings  acquisitions or repurchase of our common stock 
in addition  we expect to use a portion of any proceeds to pay down portions of our debt in order to maintain our conservative leverage and coverage ratios 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from our lines of credit or proceeds from asset sales 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to pay any distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short terms liquidity needs over the next twelve months  including recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity and capital requirements such as scheduled principal repayments  development costs  property acquisitions  if any  and other non recurring capital expenditures through net cash provided by operations  refinancing of existing indebtedness  proceeds from asset sales and or the issuance of long term debt and equity securities 

table of contents funds from operations and funds available for distribution the following table reflects the calculation of our funds from operations and funds available for distribution for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  funds from operations net income depreciation and amortization minority interest gain on disposition of property distributions on preferred operating partnership units funds from operations arden realty s percentage share arden realty s share of funds from operations funds available for distribution funds from operations straight line rent adjustment capital expenditure  tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve funds available for distribution weighted average shares common operating partnership units outstanding diluted we consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  to be a useful financial measure of our operating performance 
we believe that funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate our ability to service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our financial performance  as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 
funds from operations also is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to service our debt 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines funds from operations as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper which may differ from the standards used by other reits and  accordingly  our funds from operations may not be comparable to other reits

represents arden realty s weighted average ownership percentage during the respective twelve month period 
funds available for distribution consists of funds from operations  excluding straight line rent adjustments and less a reserve for capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions current economic climate our short and long term liquidity is significantly impacted by the operating results of our properties  all of which are located in southern california 
our ability to lease available space and increase rates when leases expire is largely dependent on the demand for office space in the markets where our properties are located 
national and local economic trends may affect demand for our properties and our ability to collect amounts due from our tenants 
we believe uncertainty over the current national and southern california economic environment are causing tenants to take longer to commit to leasing transactions  resulting in a decrease in the occupancy of 
table of contents our portfolio from as of december  to as of december  problems associated with deregulation of the electric industry in california have also resulted in significantly higher costs in some areas of the state 
the timing and extent of future changes in the national and local economy and their effects on our properties and results of operations are difficult to accurately predict 
it is possible  however  that these national and regional issues may more directly affect us and our operating results in the future  making it more difficult for us to lease and renew available space  to increase or maintain rental rates as leases expire and to collect amounts due from our tenants 
for additional information  see risk factors further declines in the economic activity of southern california will adversely affect our operating results  the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow  and rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
forward looking statements this form k  including the documents incorporated herein by reference  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act pertaining to  among other things  our future results of operations  cash available for distribution  acquisitions  lease renewals  property development  property renovation  capital requirements and general business  industry and economic conditions applicable to us 
also  documents we subsequently file with the sec and incorporated herein by reference will contain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and the matters set forth or incorporated in this form k generally 
we caution you  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive  particularly with respect to future filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure or loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
interest rate risk 
even though we currently have no such agreements  in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may use a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
some of our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates of interest  such as libor 
based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december   a increase in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured notes receivable would not have a material impact on annual future earnings  cash flows and the fair value of the secured notes receivable 
the weighted average interest rate on our floating debt as of december  was 
our fixed rate debt totaled  million as of december  with a weighted average interest rate of 
and a total fair value of approximately  million 
a decrease in interest rates on our  million of fixed rate debt would increase its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact on annual future earnings and cash flows 
a increase in interest rates in our 
table of contents  million of fixed rate debt would decrease its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact of annual future earnings and cash flows 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  however  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k readers should carefully consider the following risk factors 
real estate investment risks an inability to retain tenants or rent space upon lease expirations may adversely affect our ability to service our debt 
through   leases  including month to month leases comprising approximately of our leased net rentable square footage and approximately of our annualized base rents at december  will expire as follows percentage of percentage of number of aggregate portfolio aggregate portfolio year leases expiring leased square feet annualized base rent if we are unable to promptly relet or renew leases for all or a substantial portion of this space  or if the rent upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected  our cash flow and business could be adversely affected 
further declines in the economic activity of southern california will adversely affect our operating results 
all of our properties are located in southern california 
in  many sectors of the california economy as well as the rest of the country experienced a slowdown or contraction in economic activity 
as a result  in  there was a decrease in occupancy in the majority of our sub markets as well as a slight decrease in rental rates 
at december  our portfolio was occupied as compared to occupied at december  during  a total of approximately million square feet of occupied space  representing approximately of our total net rentable space  including month to month leases  will expire 
further deterioration of the local and national economy may result in further erosion of occupancy and rental rates and would most likely negatively affect our operating performance and property values 
competition affects occupancy levels rents and cost of land which could adversely affect our revenues 
many office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of the competing properties may be newer  better located or owned by parties better capitalized than we are 
although ownership of these competing properties is currently diversified among many different types  from publicly traded companies and institutional investors to small enterprises and individual owners  and no one or group of owners currently dominate or significantly influence the market  consolidation of owners could create efficiencies and marketing advantages for the consolidated group that could adversely affect us 
these competitive advantages  the number of competitors and the number of competitive commercial properties in a 
table of contents particular area could have a material adverse effect on the rents we can charge  our ability to lease space in our existing properties or at newly acquired or developed properties and the prices we have to pay for developable land 
the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow 
tenants may experience a downturn in their business which may cause them to miss rental payments when due or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of their leases or a delay in recovering possession of their premises 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies  we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
that illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended  may under specified circumstances impose a prohibited transaction tax on the profits derived from our sale of properties held for fewer than four years  which could affect our ability to sell our properties 
rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
problems associated with deregulation of the electric industry in california have resulted in intermittent service interruptions and significantly higher costs in some areas 
approximately of our buildings and approximately of the total net rentable square footage of our portfolio are located within municipalities that either do not produce their own power or have not entered into long term fixed price contracts 
these properties may be subject to intermittent service interruptions or significant rate increases from their utility providers 
the remaining portion of our portfolio is located in areas that are not expected to be subject to intermittent electric service interruptions and significant electric rate increases 
approximately of our buildings and of the total rentable square footage of our portfolio are subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs 
the remainder of our leases provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount 
we estimate that we will be able to recover approximately of any utility cost increases from our tenants 
although we have not experienced any material losses resulting from electric deregulation  it is possible that some of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant electric rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy problems in california continue 
increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our revenue 
except for our triple net leases  we may not be able to pass all real estate tax increases through to some of our tenants 
therefore  any tax increases may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
our properties are also subject to various federal  california and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act  and california and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with these regulatory requirements 
we cannot assure you  however  that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions and to our business 

table of contents lack of availability of insurance coverage for terrorist acts could adversely affect our financial condition 
our annual insurance policy expired in february of we have been notified by our insurance broker that in the aftermath of the september th attack  insurance carriers are either specifically excluding terrorist acts from property insurance coverage or offering this type of coverage at prohibitive costs 
although we did not derive more than of our net operating income from any one of the properties in our portfolio  a terrorist attack damaging several of our properties could materially deteriorate our operating results and overall financial condition 
we may acquire properties through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties that could result in financial dependency and management conflicts 
although we currently do not have plans to do so  we may participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships in the future 
depending on the characteristics and business objectives of the joint venture or partnership  we may not have voting control over the joint venture or partnership 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present  including our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
neither the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our governing documents prevent us from participating in joint ventures with our affiliates 
because a joint venture with an affiliate may not be negotiated in a traditional arm s length transaction  terms of the joint venture may not be as favorable to us as we could obtain if we entered into a joint venture with an outside third party 
we may not be able to integrate or finance our acquisitions 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including building systems not operating as expected  delay in or failure to lease vacant space and tenants failing to renew leases as they expire 
in addition  our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing accounting systems and property management structure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with that integration or effectively manage additional properties or that newly acquired properties will perform as expected 
changing market conditions  including competition from other purchasers of suburban office properties  may diminish our opportunities for attractive additional acquisitions 
moreover  acquisition costs of a property may exceed original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical 
our acquisitions and renovations may not perform as expected 
although we currently have no plans to significantly expand or renovate our properties  we may do so in the future 
expansion and renovation projects may inconvenience and displace existing tenants  require us to engage in time consuming up front planning and engineering activities and expend capital  and require us to obtain various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
while our policies with respect to expansion and renovation activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with these activities  we will nevertheless incur risks  including expenditures of funds on  and devotion of our time to  projects that may not be completed 

table of contents our development activities may be more expensive than anticipated and may not yield our anticipated results 
we currently have two properties under development at the howard hughes center in los angeles  california 
the estimated total costs for these two properties is approximately million 
in addition  we have preliminary architectural designs completed for additional build to suit buildings at the howard hughes center and have completed preliminary designs on a build to suit office building at our long beach airport business park  but do not intend to commence construction on any of these projects until development plans and budgets are finalized and build to suit tenant leases are signed with terms allowing us to achieve yields commensurate with the project s development risk 
we also intend to review  from time to time  other opportunities for developing and constructing office buildings and other commercial properties in accordance with our development and underwriting policies 
we expect to finance our development activities over the next months through net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset sales or proceeds from our lines of credit 
risks associated with our development activities may include abandonment of development opportunities due to a lack of financing or other reasons  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and development activities would also be subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
we are not subject to any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any single property or any single geographic area 
our governing documents do not restrict the amount or percentage of our assets that we may invest in a single property or geographic area 
all of our properties are currently in southern california and we have no immediate plans to invest outside of southern california 
this lack of diversification in our investments makes us more highly susceptible to changes affecting the southern california economy and real estate markets or damages from regional events such as earthquakes 
we may not be able to expand into new markets successfully 
while our business is currently limited to the southern california market  it is possible that we will in the future expand our business to new geographic markets 
we will not initially possess the same level of familiarity with new markets outside of southern california  which could adversely affect our ability to manage  lease  develop or acquire properties in new localities 
financing risks our significant amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million in secured debt and approximately million of unsecured debt 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents our substantial indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisition and development activity and other business purposes  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  limit our ability to refinance our debt and obtain additional debt financing  and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and real estate industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the real estate industry 
we may be able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
despite current indebtedness levels  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future 
neither the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our governing documents limit the amount or the percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow up to a maximum of million under our three lines of credit 
in addition  we have the option to increase our million unsecured line of credit by million 
if we exercised the option  we would be able to borrow up to million under our three lines of credit 
as of december   we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately million under these three lines of credit 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify and could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 
our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest when due 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness  which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity  and  if we can refinance  the terms of the refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
as of december   approximately million of principal will be coming due over the next twelve months 
if principal payments cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt and continue to service and repay our debt obligations 
rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
an increase in prevailing interest rates would have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt was variable rate debt 
increases in interest rates would also impact the refinancing of our fixed rate debt 
if interest rates are higher when our fixed debt becomes due  we may be forced to borrow at the higher rates 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including the exchange notes 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase our risks as to the other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements could be unenforceable 
as of december   we were not a party to any such agreements 
many of our properties are subject to mortgage financing which could result in foreclosure if we are unable to pay or refinance the mortgages when due 
we currently have outstanding five mortgage financings totaling million that are secured by of our properties 
the properties in each of these financings are fully cross collateralized and cross defaulted 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross defaulted  a default in one mortgage will trigger a default in the other mortgages 
the cross defaults can give the lender a number of remedies depending on the circumstances such as the right to increase the interest rate  demand additional collateral  accelerate the maturity date of the 
table of contents mortgages or foreclose on and sell the properties 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross collateralized  a default in one mortgage will allow the mortgage lender to foreclose upon and sell the properties that are not the primary collateral for the loan in default 
four additional properties are subject to single property mortgages totaling approximately million at december  if we are unable to meet our obligations under these mortgages  we could be forced to pay higher interest rates or provide additional collateral or the properties subject to the mortgages could be foreclosed upon and sold  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
tax risks our desire to qualify as a reit restricts our ability to accumulate cash that might be used in future periods to make debt payments or to fund future growth 
in order to qualify as a reit and avoid federal income tax liability  we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gain  and to avoid income taxation  our distributions must not be less than of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
to avoid excise tax liability  our distributions to our stockholders for the year must exceed the sum of of its ordinary income  of its capital gain net income  and any undistributed taxable income from prior years 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
accordingly  these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on our debt obligations and to fund future growth 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  if the operating partnership were a publicly traded partnership  it would be treated as a corporation instead of a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the internal revenue code 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as specified types of real property rents  dividends and interest 
we believe that the operating partnership would meet this test  but we cannot guarantee that it would 
if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation  it would incur substantial tax liabilities and we would fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
although we believe that we have been and will continue to be organized and have operated and will continue to operate so as to qualify for taxation as a reit  we cannot assure you that we have been or will continue to be organized or operated in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
for us to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and tests regarding various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within arden realty s control 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit  like us  that hold our assets through an investment in a partnership 
no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of qualification 
we are  however  not aware of any pending legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a reit 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code  the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by our tax counsel 

table of contents if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
if we were disqualified as a reit  our ability to raise additional capital could be significantly impaired 
this could reduce the funds we would have available to pay distributions to our stockholders and to service our debt 
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  if we have net income from a prohibited transaction  specifically sales or other taxable dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  that income will be subject to a tax 
other risks we are subject to agreements and policies that may deter change in control offers that might be attractive to our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws as well as our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  may delay  defer or prevent a third party from making offers to acquire us or control over us 
for example  such provisions may deter tender offers for our common stock  which offers may be attractive to the stockholders  and deter purchases of large blocks of common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 
our charter contains a provision designed to prevent a concentration of ownership among our stockholders that would cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of common stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals  including specific kinds of entities  at any time during the last half of our taxable year 
in addition  if we  or an owner of or more of our common stock  actually or constructively owns or more of a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  the rent received by us from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
in order to protect us against the risk of losing reit status  the ownership limit included in our charter limits actual or constructive ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock by any single stockholder to  by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the then outstanding shares of common stock 
actual or constructive ownership of shares of common stock in excess of the ownership limit will cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void with respect to the transferee or owner as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit and such shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations 
that transferee or owner will have no right to vote such shares or be entitled to dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares 
although our board of directors presently has no intention of doing so  except as described below  our board of directors could waive this restriction with respect to a particular stockholder if it were satisfied  based upon the advice of counsel or a ruling from the internal revenue service  that ownership by such stockholder in excess of the ownership limit would not jeopardize our status as a reit and our board of directors otherwise decided such action would be in our best interests 
our board of directors has waived our ownership limit with respect to mr 
ziman and certain family members and affiliates and has permitted these parties to actually and constructively own up to of the outstanding shares of common stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to cause us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or classify any unissued and reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of preferred stock and  with respect to the preferred stock  to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time  it could establish a series of preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a 
table of contents change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in august  we declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock pursuant to a stockholder plan 
subject to limited exceptions  these rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  each right will entitle stockholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of our newly created class a junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of our board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 
per right at any time before a person has acquired or more of the outstanding common stock 
the rights plan will expire in august each right entitles its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of our common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the person or group seeking to acquire or more of our common stock will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction which has not been approved by our board of directors  each right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
losses in excess of our insurance coverage or uninsured losses could adversely affect our cash flow 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance policies which currently cover all of our properties with specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances 
some losses  however  are generally not insured against because it is not economically feasible to do so 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and  in the case of debt which is recourse to us  we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss would adversely affect our cash flow with respect to the property subject to the loss 
moreover  we would generally be liable for any unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations with respect to the property subject to the loss 
an earthquake could adversely affect our business 
all of our properties are located in southern california which is a high risk geographical area for earthquakes 
depending upon its magnitude  an earthquake could severely damage our properties which would adversely affect our business 
we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties and the resulting business interruption 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient if there is a major earthquake 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
these costs may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to remediate the contamination on the property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow against the property 
persons who arrange for 
table of contents the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by that person 
some laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
finally  third parties may have claims against the owner of the site based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
specific federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose liability for release of asbestos containing material and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials 
in connection with the ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for those costs 
in the past few years  independent environmental consultants have conducted or updated phase i environmental assessments and other environmental investigations as appropriate at some of our properties 
the environmental site assessments and investigations have identified a total of properties in our portfolio  representing approximately of the total rentable square feet in the portfolio  affected by environmental concerns 
these environmental concerns include properties that may be impacted by known or suspected a contamination caused by third party sources or b soil and or groundwater contamination which has been remediated  and c those containing underground storage tanks or asbestos 
of these properties  one is believed to be affected by contamination caused by third party sources and also houses an underground storage tank  four contain friable asbestos  twelve contain non friable asbestos  and eleven house underground storage tanks only 
the property affected by contamination is primarily affected by petroleum and solvent substances  and a third party has indemnified us for any and all problems associated with this contamination 
with regard to those properties affected by asbestos  asbestos does not pose a health hazard if it is not disturbed in such a way to cause an airborne release of asbestos 
asbestos is friable when it can be crumbled  pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure  and non friable when hand pressure cannot release encapsulated asbestos fibers 
friable asbestos is more likely to be released into the air than no friable asbestos 
we manage all asbestos in ways that minimize its potential to become airborne or otherwise threaten human health 
regarding underground storage tanks  subsurface leakage of the materials contained within the tank constitutes the primary risk posed by these devices 
we comply with all applicable laws  including double wall construction  testing protocols  placement of tanks within bermed areas  and the installation of leak and spill detection equipment  to minimize the risks posed by underground storage tanks 
the environmental site assessments and investigations have not  however  revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that our environmental site assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products  except as noted above 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties  other than as noted above 
it is possible that future laws will impose material environmental liabilities on us and that the current environmental condition of our properties will be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us
