table of contents market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  d b employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
in  the company s use of derivatives was limited to the use of short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign exchange denominated loans  and interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on the fixed rate bond 
the company s objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company maintains a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of the company s total debt exposure as established by policy 
to achieve the policy objectives  the company may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
d b s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings  cash flow and financial position volatility in its european and apla operations 
d b follows a policy of hedging substantially all cross border intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of its various subsidiaries 
d b only uses short term foreign exchange forward contracts to implement its hedging strategy 
typically  these contracts have maturities of six months or less 
these forward contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and the swedish krona 
a discussion of d b s accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in  d b purchased the third party fixed rate minority interest obligation by issuing a five year  fixed rate bond that matures in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
d b also entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with notional principal amounts totaling million see note to the consolidated financial statements  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against a portion of the long term fixed rate bonds 
the arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge  and there is no impact on earnings 
the swaps and hedged portion of the bonds are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
the swaps are considered highly effective hedges  with changes in fair value of the swaps offsetting the impact on earnings of changes in the fair value of the hedged bonds 
at december  the company had no floating rate debt outstanding 
foreign exchange risk d b operates in countries through wholly owned entities and in eight countries through minority interests in joint ventures  and principally uses the capital markets to fund its operations 
d b s non us operations generated approximately of total revenues in as of december   approximately of d b s assets were located outside the us  and no single country outside the us had a significant concentration of d b s aggregate cash balances 
as in prior years  the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset the earnings impact of transaction gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated inter company loans 
the underlying loans and the corresponding forward contracts are marked to market at each quarter end  are fully disclosed within the financial statements and have a minimal impact on earnings 
the fair value of the foreign currency risk is estimated by calculating the cost of closing out all foreign exchange contracts given a increase or decrease in forward rates from their december  levels 
at december   d b had approximately million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
table of contents with net losses of 
million 
if forward rates were to increase from year end levels  the net gain would be million 
if forward rates were to decrease from year end levels  the net loss would be million 
however  the estimated potential gain or loss on these contracts is expected to be offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
therefore  the net effect of a movement in foreign exchange rates would have a minimal impact on earnings 
other risks see note to the consolidated financial statements old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
at this time  management is unable to predict the extent of such reviews  their outcome or whether the resolution of these matters could materially affect d b s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
pursuant to the distribution agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  d b and moody s each agreed to be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise with respect to the reviews described above  to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during and on june   the irs  as part of its audit process  issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and old d b responded by filing a petition for a refund in the us district court for the district of columbia on september  pursuant to a series of agreements  ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and donnelley the other half  of any payments for taxes and accrued interest arising from this matter and certain other potential tax liabilities after donnelley pays the first million 
in connection with the distribution  old d b and donnelley entered into an agreement whereby old d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley arising from these tax matters and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities 
on may   an amended tax return was filed for the and tax periods  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
old d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   which old d b funded with short term borrowings 
ims health has informed d b that it paid to the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing 
notwithstanding the filing and payment  d b is contesting the irs s formal assessment and will also contest the assessment of amounts  if any  in excess of the amounts paid 
d b has accrued its anticipated share of the probable liability arising from the utilization of these capital losses 
d b and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of d b in connection with such matters will not have a material effect on d b s operating results  cash flows or financial position 
liquidity and financial position management believes that cash flows generated from its operations and supplemented as needed with readily available financing arrangements are sufficient to meet the short term and long term needs of d b 
d b accesses the commercial paper market from time to time to fund working capital needs and share repurchases 
such borrowings have been supported by d b s bank credit facilities

the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our businesses are described in more detail below 
however  these are not the only risks and uncertainties that d b faces 
our businesses may face additional risks and uncertainties that are unknown to d b at this time 

table of contents economic or other conditions might lead to a reduction in the demand for d b s products and services worldwide 
the current economic slowdown may worsen and or persist for an unpredictable period of time 
demand for many of d b s products and services is influenced by economic trends 
as a result  downturns in the united states economy or in the global economy may cause decreased demand for d b s products and services 
a decline in the demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on d b s revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the current economic climate  d b has experienced a reduction in the demand for certain of its marketing products and services as customers have looked for ways to reduce their expenses 
the current economic slowdown may worsen and or persist for an unpredictable period of time 
if d b is unable to successfully control its own expenses  it could suffer lower net income and earnings per share 
d b may be unable to successfully implement the blueprint for growth  including the ability to achieve its financial flexibility objectives on the terms and conditions contemplated 
in d b adopted its blueprint for growth strategy which involves significant investments  reallocating spending  and becoming an important player in bb e business 
to execute this strategy  d b announced two phases of a financial flexibility program intended to reduce expenses to generate approximately million annually 
if d b is unable to generate the expected savings from the financial flexibility program on the terms and conditions contemplated  its ability to implement the investments contemplated by its strategy may be adversely affected 
the inability to achieve the financial flexibility objectives on the terms and conditions contemplated or the failure to successfully implement the other programs under the blueprint for growth could have an adverse effect on d b s revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
d b may be unable to successfully adapt to changes in the business information and risk management industries and markets  including changes in customer preferences for products and product delivery formats resulting from advances in information technology 
d b provides information and services to its customers in a variety of formats  including printed formats  electronic formats  and over the internet 
advances in information technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and product delivery formats 
if it does not successfully adapt its products and services to take advantage of changes in technology and customer preferences  d b s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
d b adopted an internet strategy because it believes that the internet represents an important and rapidly evolving market for marketing information products and services 
because its bb strategy is in the early stages of development and involves systems integration with its customers  d b does not know if this strategy will be successful 
d b s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if it fails to develop products and services that are well suited to the internet market  experiences difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and services  or fails to achieve sufficient traffic to its internet sites to generate significant revenues  or to successfully implement e business operations 
d b faces competition that may cause price reductions and or loss of market share 
all of d b s businesses are highly competitive 
d b competes directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to business customers 
in addition  business information and related products and services are becoming increasingly available  principally as a result of the expansion of the internet and as new providers of bb information products and services emerge 
in its information services businesses  d b also faces competition from in house operations of the businesses it seeks as customers  from other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and 
table of contents professional services providers  banks  credit insurers and the internet 
intense competition could harm d b by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
there are risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries  including foreign economic conditions  exchange rate fluctuations  the regulatory environment  and cultural factors 
d b conducts business outside of the united states 
as a result  its operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include regulatory  political or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures  and other regulatory requirements 
although foreign currency translation gains and losses are not currently material to d b s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  an increase in foreign revenues could subject d b to foreign currency translation risks in the future 
additional risks inherent in its non us business activities generally include  among others  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs of and difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights 
d b may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity  or the interruption of telecommunication links or power sources 
d b s ability to protect its data centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other disasters is critical to its future 
the on line services d b provides are dependent on links to telecommunication providers 
d b believes it has taken reasonable precautions to protect its data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt operations 
nonetheless  any damage to d b s data centers or any failure of its telecommunications links that causes interruptions in operations could materially adversely affect its ability to meet customers requirements  which could result in decreased revenues  net income  and earnings per share 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments may adversely affect d b s ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data 
certain data and services provided by d b are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states as well as those in canada  europe and certain countries within the asia pacific and latin american regions 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy concerns  particularly as they relate to the internet 
this concern is likely to result in new laws and regulations 
compliance with existing federal  state and local laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected its business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future international  federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of data and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may increasingly affect d b s operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
data suppliers might withdraw data from d b  leading to an inability to provide products and services 
much of the data that d b uses is obtained from third parties  including public record sources 
d b could suffer a material adverse effect if owners of the data it uses were to withdraw the data 
data providers could withdraw their data from d b if there is a competitive reason to do so or if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data 
if a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data  d b s ability to provide products and services to its customers could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share
