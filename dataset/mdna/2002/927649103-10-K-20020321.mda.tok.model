jon  zema  mardel  francodex and pet tabs brand names 
on march   the company  formerly named agri nutrition group limited  merged with virbac  inc  with the company being the surviving corporation 
virbac s 
a  the parent of virbac  inc  received of the voting equity of the company  therefore  virbac  inc was considered to be the acquirer for financial statement purposes 
accordingly  the merger was accounted for as a purchase of agri nutrition group limited by virbac  inc in conjunction with the merger  the company assessed  formulated  and announced plans to consolidate its manufacturing and distribution operations 
under the plan  which was completed prior to the end of  nearly all pet product distribution operations were transferred from agnu s chicago  illinois  and los angeles  california facilities to the company s larger fort worth  texas facility 
all manufacturing and distribution operations  which had been carried out at the chicago facility  ceased  and such operations were transferred to other existing company facilities 
in addition  manufacturing and distribution operations related to the majority of products previously produced at the los angeles facility were transferred to the fort worth facility  with only certain production and marketing activities remaining in california 
the cost to close the chicago facility comprised mostly of severance costs and future lease obligations and relocation costs for certain key members of the manufacturing team  were approximately  the severance costs were paid as of december  and the lease obligation was paid in fiscal these costs are included in the purchase price allocation of the merger 
on december   the united states securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  which became effective for the company during the fourth quarter of this pronouncement required a change in the way in which the company recorded revenues 
prior to the implementation of sab  the company recognized revenues when the product was shipped from the company s distribution facility due to the transfer of the risk of loss 
the cumulative effect of this change for periods prior to december  of  or per share  is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the net effect for fiscal of this change was to reduce sales by  and diluted earnings per share by 
the pro forma amounts for are not determinable due to the unavailability of the accounting records 
during  the company changed its shipping terms with its customers so that ownership transferred at the time of shipment 
because of the accounting change discussed above  the company recorded million of sales and diluted earnings per share of in the first quarter of when the risk of ownership had passed to its customers while the product had shipped in the fourth quarter of during  the company changed its shipping terms with its customers so that the risk of ownership transferred at the time of shipment 
therefore  there was not a similar offsetting amount in the fourth quarter of to be carried over to the management s discussion and analysis that follows and the other documents incorporated by reference contain forward looking information made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated  including without limitation o inaccurate projections of new competitive products or technological entries into the market could adversely affect sales forecasts 
o a lack of acceptance of the company s products by the market could adversely affect sales projections 
o projections of future revenues related to products not yet registered with certain governmental agencies could differ significantly if those registrations are not received in the time periods anticipated 
o projections regarding interest rates and changes to those rates could differ significantly from company projections 
o the company receives significant support from its majority owner  vbsa 
this support includes product development  research expenditures made that benefit the company  short term borrowings  and worldwide distribution of the company s products 
o the company could experience a decrease in the demand for its products  which could result in reduced funding available under the company s lines of credit 
therefore  the company s actual results could differ materially from such forward looking statements 
results of operations the results of operations of the company are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
o the company records estimated reductions in revenue for product returns 
should a greater proportion of product be returned in later periods than was estimated  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments  additional provisions may be required 
o the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions or demand is less favorable than management projected  additional write downs may be required 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o the company has recorded unearned income related to its distribution agreement with pfizer 
the ability of the company to recognize this as income is dependent upon the company obtaining registrations permitting it to sell these products from the appropriate governmental agencies 
the company also will record the income based upon estimates of when the sales of these products will occur 
if the registrations are not received in a timely manner or certain other conditions are not met  the company would be required to repay some or all of the unearned income to pfizer 
in addition  if the actual sales of the products are lower than the initial estimates  the company would have to reduce future period revenues

in return  the company pays a royalty to vbsa when the company begins to sell the product 
as a result  the company has lower costs to develop and register a product and the company can get the product to the marketplace sooner than if the company performed these tasks by itself 
for year ended december  the company s primary sources of liquidity during were cash flows from operations  sales of product licenses  and bank borrowings 
net income and depreciation and amortization generated operating cash flows of million  which was partially offset by uses of cash to purchase inventory and to fund increased accounts receivable

this temporary increase was to be repaid in installments from february to july of the remaining million  million is subject to a borrowing formula based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory and serves as a revolving line of credit 
the availability of the remaining million will be reduced by  per quarter

inventory increased for several reasons including the build up in inventory prior to commencing the consolidation of the manufacturing and distribution facilities to reduce the interruption of service to customers  low levels of inventory at the beginning of the year  which had created a significant back order position  and the build up of inventory by pmr to serve the dealer distribution network

pursuant to the merger agreement  such tender offer  if necessary  would be funded by vbsa s direct purchase from the company of  shares of common stock at per share 
however  as of august   the closing price of the company s stock was per share or greater for consecutive trading days  so this tender offer was not required and will not be made 
quarterly effects and seasonality the results of operations of certain products in the veterinary product line  including virbac s flea and tick collars  have been seasonal with a lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the canine heartworm products are expected to have higher sales volumes in the first and second quarters each year 
the results of operations of the company s consumer brands segment have also been seasonal with a relatively lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s fourth quarter 
seasonal patterns of pmr s operations are highly dependent on weather  feeding economics  and the timing of customer orders

new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles have been evaluated against these new criteria and no reclassifications were necessary 
the company adopted sfas no 
in in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  as a result of this change in accounting rule  the company will not be amortizing its goodwill and so expenses in future years will be reduced by million 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provision of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are removes goodwill from its scope and  therefore  eliminates the requirements of sfas to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment  and describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which an alternative course of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the company does not anticipate the necessity to record a charge to income or an adjustment to its long lived assets because of this pronouncement 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any derivative instruments that materially increase its exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks 
in addition  the company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
the company s exposure to market risks results from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk exists principally with respect to long term indebtedness  which bears interest at floating rates 
at december   the company had million of indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates 
if an unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate applicable to the company s floating rate indebtedness had occurred in the twelve month period ended december   the company would have experienced additional interest expense of  for this twelve month period 
this assumes no change in the principal or a reduction of such indebtedness
