anchor acquisition on december   we completed our acquisition of anchor gaming anchor whereby anchor became a wholly owned subsidiary of igt 
the acquisition resulted in the addition of two new lines of business  lottery and pari mutuel systems and casino operations 
the lottery and pari mutuel operations provide equipment and related services to online lotteries and pari mutuel organizations 
in june  we committed to a plan to sell the casino operations acquired with anchor 
casino operations included the colorado central station casino  the colorado grande casino and the nevada gaming machine route operations 
we determined that these assets were not a strategic fit with our core business 
as a result  our casino operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the allocation of the anchor acquisition purchase price continues to be subject to refinement as we continue to finalize the integration of anchor s businesses and the fair value and estimated useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
igt and anchor have worked together since as jv partners 
the most notable change to our financial results following the acquisition was the consolidation of our joint venture with anchor  the spin for cash joint venture jv  which was previously accounted for under the equity method  whereby revenues were reflected  net of expenses  in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our statements of income 
results of operations we operate principally in three lines of business product sales encompasses the development  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and sales of computerized gaming products and systems  proprietary gaming includes the development  marketing and operations of wide area progressive wap systems  stand alone games  and gaming equipment leasing  and lottery systems consists of the development  manufacturing  operation and sale of online lottery and pari mutuel systems and related equipment 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal adjusted net income for fiscal increased to million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal the acquisition of anchor and the consolidation of the jv contributed significantly to this improvement 
in june  we committed to a plan to sell our casino operations acquired with anchor and as a result the casino operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
we recognized an extraordinary loss on early redemption of debt primarily related to our cash tender offer to repurchase anchor s outstanding senior subordinated notes 
one time items also included litigation accruals primarily related to a dispute with a former gaming machine distributor 
at the beginning of fiscal we ceased amortization of goodwill related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas 
for comparability  fiscal adjusted net income included the elimination of goodwill amortization 
fiscal years ended september september reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income amounts in millions  except per share amounts per share per share net income one time items  net of tax income from discontinued operations extraordinary loss on early redemption of debt litigation accruals goodwill amortization ceased in adjusted net income operating income operating income for fiscal grew to million from million in fiscal post acquisition contributions from anchor and the consolidation of the jv drove this increase 
additionally  product sales gross margins strengthened and we experienced enhanced yield per proprietary game compared to the prior year 
prior to the anchor acquisition on december   our revenue from the jv was presented  net of expenses  in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
given that current revenues include the jv  but our prior year revenues do not  operating income as a percentage of revenue is not comparable to prior years except on a pro forma basis 
if the anchor acquisition and the consolidation of the jv had been effective at the beginning of fiscal  pro forma revenue would have totaled billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal pro forma operating income before anchor one time impairment and restructuring charges would have totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal pro forma operating income before one time impairment and restructuring charges as a percentage of revenue improved to in fiscal versus in fiscal revenues and gross profit total revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal climbed to billion compared to billion in the prior fiscal year 
anchor s operations and the consolidated results of the jv activities for the nine months since acquisition contributed million in total revenues and million in total gross profit in the current fiscal year 
product sales revenue from product sales reached million on shipments of  units worldwide in fiscal sales in the prior year totaled million on shipments of  units worldwide 
replacement needs drove demand for our products across most domestic and international markets in the current fiscal year 
total replacement sales increased to  units for fiscal compared to  units in fiscal gross profit margins on product sales improved to in the current year versus in the prior year  primarily due to ongoing operational efficiencies and lower component costs 
fiscal domestic shipments of  units were slightly behind the prior fiscal year of  machines 
the decrease in domestic unit sales resulted from fewer shipments to new or expanded properties in the nevada and california markets  offset by greater volume across all of our other north american markets 
domestic replacement sales for the current fiscal year increased to  units compared to  units in the prior fiscal year 
igt innovations in slot technology  such as multi denomination tm games  customer acceptance of new games  as well as growing demand for ticket in ticket out tito technology and our related ez pay tm systems  contributed significantly to the increase in replacement sales 
several multi property casino operators have committed to replace existing slot machines with our ez pay tm systems and tito equipped machines throughout their major casino resorts 
the declines in domestic shipments were offset by increased international product shipments 
international units increased to  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year reflecting improvements across all international markets except latin america and south africa 
proprietary gaming gaming operations revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased to million in the current fiscal year compared to million in fiscal gross profit from proprietary gaming operations climbed to million compared to million in the prior year 
these improvements resulted primarily from the inclusion of anchor and the consolidation of the jv subsequent to the acquisition  along with a favorable jurisdictional mix and enhanced yield per game 
the total installed base of our proprietary games  including joint venture and alliance units ended the current fiscal year at  units 
during fiscal  proprietary game placements declined in nevada and atlantic city by  units  offset by  additional placements in us regional and native american jurisdictions 
during the current year our win per unit improved due to the continued popularity and player preference for our proprietary games 
the newest  highest revenue producing themes in fiscal included harley davidson r  diamond cinema r  regis cash club  the price is right tm and american bandstand r 
during fiscal we were also able to improve our yield per game by diversifying the geographical placement of games focusing on higher win per unit jurisdictions 
we recognize that all games  including our proprietary games  have a finite life cycle 
due to the intense competition and accelerated pace of proprietary games introduced into the market each year the lifecycle of these games can vary significantly 
as a result  we systematically replace games experiencing declining play levels with new game introductions  as well as extensions of existing brands  that incorporate enhanced entertainment value and improved player appeal 
our strategy is to grow the installed base of proprietary games while preserving the margins by cost effectively deploying games in jurisdictions that provide the best yield per game 
lottery and pari mutuel systems revenue from lottery and pari mutuel systems  acquired as part of the anchor acquisition  totaled million for fiscal  producing gross profits of million or of related revenues 
current year revenues were favorably impacted by increased florida incentive and terminal fees  as well as the sale of terminals in maryland 
florida revenues increased due to increased play resulting from a large lotto jackpot  partially offset by reduced powerball revenues resulting from reduced play subsequent to a large jackpot in operating expenses operating expenses for the current fiscal year totaled million compared to million in fiscal the inclusion of anchor s operations during the fiscal year accounted for increases in all operating expense categories except bad debt expense 
operating expenses included million in fiscal and million in fiscal to update our internal software systems with an enterprise resource planning erp solution 
expenses also increased due to legal costs related to protection of our intellectual property along with our ongoing investment in research and development r d 
bad debt expense for the current fiscal year includes additional provisions recorded for argentina receivables due to the economic instability and currency devaluation in that country 
at the beginning of the current fiscal year  we elected to adopt the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which allowed us to cease amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
adoption of this pronouncement provided us with a pre tax benefit of approximately million for the current fiscal year 
intangible assets with finite lives resulting from the anchor acquisition increased amortization expense by million for the current fiscal year 
other income and expense other expense  net  totaled million for the current fiscal year compared to million in higher net expenses for the current fiscal year resulted from interest expense on the debt acquired with anchor and one time litigation accruals of million 
anchor s debt was substantially paid off in july our worldwide tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal related primarily to the anchor acquisition 
we expect our tax rate for fiscal to fluctuate between and 
discontinued operations in june  we committed to a plan to sell our casino operations acquired in connection with the anchor acquisition 
this includes the two casinos in colorado the colorado central station and the colorado grande casino and the nevada slot route operation 
in december  we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which herbst gaming will purchase substantially all of the assets of the nevada slot route operations of anchor coin  a subsidiary of igt 
the sale is subject to herbst gaming obtaining the required financing and regulatory and third party approvals  including gaming regulatory approvals and expiration of the waiting period under hart scott rodino act 
the transaction is expected to be complete in our quarter ending march as a result of the decision to reclassify our casino operations to discontinued operations  we ceased depreciation and amortization of the related assets 
our statements of income reflected the casino operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
current year income from discontinued operations  net of tax  totaled million 
business segments operating profit see note of our consolidated financial statements igt s operating profit by segment reflects income from continuing operations before tax  including an appropriate allocation of operating expenses  as well as interest income  interest expense and other expenses  net 
our proprietary gaming segment includes both our wholly owned gaming operations and our unconsolidated joint venture activities reported as earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
our current year operating results included nine months of anchor s financial results and the consolidation of the jv subsequent to acquisition 
product sales operating profit for fiscal increased to million or of related revenues up from million or of related revenue in fiscal this improvement related primarily to volume growth and increased gross profit margins  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
operating profits from proprietary gaming improved to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these improvements resulted primarily from the consolidation of the jv activities and the inclusion of anchor s results for nine months subsequent to the acquisition  growth in our installed base  and enhanced yield per game 
as a percentage of revenue and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  proprietary gaming segment profit totaled in the current year compared to in fiscal this fluctuation is primarily due to a greater portion of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  recorded net of expenses  included in the prior year 
current year operating profit from our lottery systems segment totaled million or of related revenues 
the lottery segment benefited from increased revenues in florida and maryland 
foreign operations approximately of our total revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal were derived outside of north america  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal to date  we have not experienced material translation or transaction losses related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal adjusted net income for fiscal totaled million or per diluted share 
one time items in fiscal included a legal settlement gain from the resolution of legal actions between igt and wms related to patent infringement claims 
we also recognized a loss on the sale of the olympic gaming system in australia and a gain on the sale of barcrest s japanese subsidiary 
fiscal years ended september september reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income amounts in millions  except per share amounts per share per share net income one time items  net of tax legal settlement gain loss on sale of olympic gaming system gain on sale of barcrest s japanese subsidiary adjusted net income operating income operating income for fiscal totaled million  a increase over fiscal operating income of million 
operating margins were and for fiscal and this substantial growth was driven by improved margins in both the product sales and proprietary gaming segments 
revenues and gross profit total revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal grew to billion compared to billion for fiscal product sales and gaming operations posted substantial gains  increasing and over fiscal both areas also contributed to the overall gross profit of million for fiscal year versus million in fiscal product sales product sales reached million on shipments of  units worldwide for fiscal comparatively  fiscal sales totaled million on shipments of  units 
a increase in domestic shipments drove this improvement  with  units in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal replacement sales of  machines domestically represented a increase over fiscal replacement sales were especially strong in the nevada  midwestern and native american markets 
igt innovations in slot technology such as multi denomination tm games and ez pay tm games and systems along with strong player acceptance of new games helped stimulate these replacement sales 
fiscal sales of  machines into the new california native american market contributed significantly to the increase 
igt also provided gaming machines to several new casinos during fiscal including the texas casino  palms casino and green valley ranch in las vegas  and the san manuel in california 
international shipments declined to  units in fiscal versus  units during fiscal japanese shipments slowed to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal due to difficulties experienced in bringing popular new games to the market 
australia realized improvements from the standardization of its product line resulting in unit sales of  a increase over fiscal slight declines were experienced by the united kingdom uk  europe and africa  with offsetting improvements in latin america 
product sales margins rose to during fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of volume efficiencies and a higher percentage of domestic sales 
proprietary gaming gaming operations revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates totaled million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the combination of the ongoing popularity of our established proprietary games  such as wheel of fortune r  and the successful introduction of new games drove positive financial results 
the newest games in our proprietary games family  jeopardy r video slots  the addams family tm  austin powers tm  the price is right tm and the  pyramid tm along with the joint venture game i dream of jeannie tm  contributed significantly to the overall improvement 
the total installed base of our proprietary games  including joint venture and strategic alliance games  increased to  units  a growth rate of over the installed base of  games in fiscal in recognition that all games have a finite lifecycle  igt systematically replaces legacy proprietary games experiencing declining play levels with new games incorporating enhanced entertainment value and improved player appeal 
gross margin contributions from proprietary gaming totaled million in  higher than the million recorded in fiscal the resulting gross profit percentage declined two percentage points in fiscal to 
significant interest rate cuts during fiscal adversely impacted our cost of funding jackpot payments 
the fiscal installed base also had a larger percentage of theme games  which carry additional royalty costs 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled million in fiscal versus million for fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million as a result of higher variable commission and incentive costs  along with additional legal and compliance costs in support of stronger sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization expense  not included in cost of sales  declined slightly to million 
r d expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal additional personnel and related costs to support our commitment to innovative game development resulted in this increase 
bad debt expense increased million related to increased sales volume and specific reserves related to international receivables 
other income and expense other expense  net  totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the primary difference in the two periods relates to the legal settlement received in fiscal additionally  gains on investments declined million based on corporate cash investment timing and market conditions 
our worldwide tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal business segments operating profit see note of our consolidated financial statements igt s segment profit reflects income from continuing operations before tax including an appropriate allocation of operating expenses  as well as interest income  interest expense and other expenses 
our proprietary gaming segment includes both our wholly owned gaming operations and our unconsolidated joint venture activities reported as earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
product sales operating profit grew to million or of related revenues for fiscal compared to million or for fiscal this significant improvement reflects the growth in domestic sales partially offset by increased r d costs 
in fiscal  operating profit for the proprietary gaming segment reached million  an increase of million or over fiscal this improvement resulted from the growth of the installed base of our proprietary machines and the popularity of both the established games such as wheel of fortune r and our newer proprietary games themes 
this improvement was slightly offset by the increased cost of funding jackpot payments and higher royalty costs 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources capital resources one of igt s fundamental financial strengths is our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business 
we anticipate that our operating activities in fiscal will continue to provide us with cash flows to assist in our business expansion and to meet our financial commitments 
our sources of capital also include  but are not limited to  the issuance of public or private placement debt  bank borrowings  and the issuance of equity securities 
with the completion of the anchor acquisition  we have additional sources of capital from its operations 
we believe that our available short term and long term capital resources are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and operating capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest and income tax obligations  strategic investments and acquisitions  and share repurchases 
our sources of capital afford us the financial flexibility to target acquisitions of businesses that offer opportunities to implement our operating strategies  increase our rates of return  and improve shareholder value 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operations in fiscal totaled million  an increase of million from fiscal the most significant fluctuation was due to the inclusion of anchor s operating results and the consolidation of the jv for the nine months subsequent to acquisition 
additional improvements to cash flow generated from operations were derived predominantly from improvements in inventories and receivables  as well as timing of payments for prepaid expenses  distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  and accrued and deferred taxes 
fiscal cash provided by operations totaled million  an increase of million from fiscal  primarily as the result of favorable operating performance 
cash flow from investing activities net cash flow from investing activities provided million in the current fiscal year compared to million used in fiscal this increase is primarily related to the anchor acquisition and consolidation of the jv 
other significant increases in the current year cash flows from investing activities related to proceeds from the sale of anchor s pala management contract and a decrease in cash advanced on loans receivable 
in  investing activities used an additional million in cash compared to fiscal this increase was the result of business acquisitions during and a decrease in proceeds from disposals of investments and other assets 
fiscal included million in proceeds from sale of the miss marquette riverboat  a held for sale asset acquired in the purchase of sodak gaming in fiscal total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the percentage distribution by geographic operating segment for fiscal   and are as follows fiscal years amounts in millions capital expenditures domestic international the increase in fiscal over fiscal spending is primarily due to investments to improve the productivity of operations 
we invested million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal to update our internal software systems with an erp solution 
cash flow from financing activities net cash used for financing activities in fiscal was million compared to million used in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily due to the use of million for purchases of treasury stock and million for principal payments on long term debt  primarily related to the early redemption of anchor s debt 
the change between and was primarily due to decreased purchases of treasury stock in fiscal other cash flow information inventory transfers to gaming operations equipment the million of net cash used for inventory in fiscal is comprised of the million net decrease in our inventory balances  million of inventory added through acquisition and million in currency translation adjustment  and offset by million of obsolescence and million of non cash transfers to gaming operations equipment 
property  plant  and equipment increased during fiscal year as the result of capital expenditures and non cash transfers of machines from inventory to gaming operations equipment  as well as assets acquired from the anchor acquisition 
net cash flow from proprietary progressive jackpot systems wap games differ from stand alone and hybrid games in that they are electronically linked  inter casino systems that connect gaming machines to a central computer  allowing the system to build a progressive jackpot with every wager until a player hits the top award winning combination 
only wap systems have related jackpot liabilities and investments to fund future jackpot payments 
our proprietary wap systems provide cash through collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and from maturities of us government securities purchased to fund future annual jackpot payments 
cash is used to make payments to jackpot winners for jackpot liabilities or to purchase us government securities to fund future jackpot payments 
the purchase of and proceeds from investments to fund jackpot liabilities are classified as investing activities 
collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and payments to winners are classified as financing activities 
net cash flows from these activities represent timing differences between the growth in liabilities for jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period 
fluctuations in net cash flows from systems occur based on the timing of the jackpot cycles and the volume of play across all of our proprietary progressive jackpot systems games 
net cash flow from these activities collectively provided cash of million in fiscal  million in and used cash of million in fiscal stock repurchase plan our board of directors authorized igt s stock repurchase plan in as of november   the remaining share repurchase authorization  as amended  totaled million shares 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million  including million shares repurchased pursuant to an issuer tender offer at per share 
credit facilities and indebtedness our domestic and foreign borrowing facilities totaled million at september  of this amount  million was drawn with an average interest rate of  million was reserved for letters of credit and the remaining million was available for future borrowings 
we are required to comply with certain covenants contained in these agreements  which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  acquisitions  dispositions  or to pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments without the written consent of the lenders and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
igt assumed approximately million  net of discount  of anchor s long term debt upon the completion of the acquisition 
immediately following the acquisition  we fully repaid and terminated anchor s senior credit facility of million using available cash 
during the current fiscal year we repurchased million face value of anchor s outstanding fixed rate senior subordinated notes due  primarily in a cash tender offer in july  using available cash 
this transaction extinguished substantially all of the debt outstanding that was assumed in the anchor acquisition 
we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of tax  or per diluted share related to the early extinguishment of this debt 
in fiscal  we issued billion of senior notes in two tranches  million at due may  and million at due may   in a private placement subsequently exchanged for registered notes 
during the current fiscal year  we repurchased million of these senior notes using available cash recognizing an extraordinary loss of approximately  net of tax  or per diluted share 
the issuance of these senior notes could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on our indebtedness and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and disadvantaging us compared to competitors with less indebtedness 
the indenture contains a number of covenants  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens on our assets  or enter into sale leaseback transactions 
at september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations on the remaining senior notes outstanding and our other indebtedness will depend on our future performance 
in addition  our bank revolving line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial ratio tests 
our ability to maintain such ratio tests will also depend on our future performance which is subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we were unable to maintain the financial ratio tests under the bank revolving line of credit  the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if this happened  other indebtedness that contains cross default or cross acceleration provisions  including the senior notes  may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events should occur  we may not be able to pay such amounts 
at september   we had million outstanding in long term debt  net of unamortized discount  compared to million at september  liquidated damages under online lottery contracts our lottery contracts typically permit termination of the contract by the lottery authority at any time for our failure to perform or for other specified reasons and generally contain demanding implementation and performance schedules 
failure to perform under such contracts may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages  as well as contract termination 
many of our lottery contracts also permit the lottery authority to terminate the contract at will and do not specify the compensation  if any  to which we would be entitled should such termination occur 
some of our us lottery contracts have contained provisions for up to million a day in liquidated damages for late system start up and have provided for up to  per minute or more in penalties for system downtime in excess of a stipulated grace period 
some of our international customers similarly reserve the right to assess monetary damages in the event of contract termination or breach 
although such liquidated damages provisions are customary in the lottery industry and the actual liquidated damages imposed are generally subject to negotiation  such provisions in our lottery contracts present an ongoing potential for significant additional expense 
our lottery contracts generally require us to post a performance bond  which may be substantial  securing our performance under such contracts 
at september   we had million accrued for liquidated damages 
financial condition september september amounts in millions total assets   total liabilities and minority interest   total stockholders equity  total assets increased billion during fiscal year primarily due to the acquisition of anchor  and the associated consolidation of the jv 
this acquisition significantly impacted the increase in property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments to fund jackpot liabilities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
inventories decreased over the prior year reflecting better management of inventory quantities 
total liabilities and minority interest at september  increased million  related to the anchor acquisition and consolidation of the jv  offset by subsequent debt repayments 
the consolidation of the jv was the most significant component of the increase in our jackpot liabilities and accrued income taxes 
additionally  other accrued liabilities were also affected by additional litigation accruals 
the reduction in accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of payments on stock repurchases initiated in fiscal and settled in fiscal total stockholders equity increased billion  predominantly due to the fair value of shares issued for the acquisition of anchor 
net income generated during the current year also increased stockholders equity  offset by treasury stock repurchases 
additional paid in capital also increased as the result of employee stock plans 
off balance sheet activities in the normal course of business  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as performance bonds and other guarantees  which are not reflected in our balance sheet 
we do not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet instruments and we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we had performance bonds outstanding  related to our operation of several lottery systems and a gaming machine route  totaling million at september  and million at september  the amount outstanding at september  included million related to lottery systems acquired with anchor 
we are liable to reimburse the bond issuer in the event the bond is exercised as a result of our nonperformance 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding off balance sheet information 
our linked progressive systems in iowa and new jersey are administered by trusts consisting of participating casino members 
we have agreed to loan to these trusts  upon request  and subject to certain limitations  amounts necessary to meet substantially all obligations of the trusts 
trust assets and liabilities are primarily related to jackpot liabilities and the cash and investments used to fund those jackpot liabilities 
at september   trust assets were greater than liabilities to third parties and we had no trust loans outstanding 
impact of inflation in the last three years  the general level of inflation affecting us has not had a significant effect on our operations 
inflation affects the way we operate in many markets worldwide 
in general  we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability 
our ability to pass on future cost increases in the form of higher sales prices will continue to be dependent on the prevailing competitive environment and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
recently issued accounting standards igt keeps abreast of new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  securities and exchange commission sec and other standard setting agencies 
recently issued accounting standards affecting our financial results are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications certain amounts in the prior years comparative consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation used in the current fiscal year 
euro currency conversions on january   of member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency  the euro 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins were issued and the former currencies were withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion established and implemented the euro currency conversion at the beginning of fiscal the conversion to the euro included adapting financial systems and business processes  changing equipment  such as coin validators and note acceptors  to accommodate euro denominated transactions in our current products  and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
we have not incurred material system and equipment conversion costs related exclusively to the euro 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects that one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  igt is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the program is operated pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies 
the counter parties to these instruments are major financial institutions and we believe that credit loss in the event of nonperformance is remote 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
foreign currency management we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities of our operations 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
the primary business objective of our hedging program is to minimize the impact to our earnings resulting from exchange rate changes 
at september   we had net foreign currency exposure of million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional foreign currency and million for a firm sales commitment denominated in canadian dollars 
these exposures were hedged with million in forward currency contracts 
at september   we had net foreign currency exposure of million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional foreign currency  hedged with million in forward contracts 
given our foreign exchange position  a percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
igt does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating results include the australian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen and the euro 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating results by approximately million in the current fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk fluctuations in prime  treasury and agency rates due to changes in market and other economic conditions directly impact our cost to fund jackpots  and therefore the gross profit in our proprietary gaming operations 
if interest rates decline  our cost to fund jackpots increases  and correspondingly our gross profit declines 
since fiscal  we have experienced declining interest rates which have lowered our proprietary gaming gross profits 
we estimated that a decline in interest rates would have reduced our proprietary gaming gross profit by million in fiscal and million in igt currently does not manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
our outstanding senior notes carry interest at fixed rates 
if interest rates increased by  the fair market value of these notes would have decreased approximately million at september  and million at september
