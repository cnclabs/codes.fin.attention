liquidity and capital resources finlay s primary capital requirements are for funding working capital for new departments and for working capital growth of existing departments and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new departments  renovating existing departments and information technology investments 
for and  capital expenditures totaled million exclusive of the fixed assets acquired in the jb rudolph acquisition  which totaled million and million  respectively 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately to million 
although capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  to date this limitation has not precluded the company from satisfying its capital expenditure requirements

the company intends to renew the revolving credit agreement and expects to begin this process during the summer of there can be no assurances that a new revolving credit facility will be executed on terms equal to or more favorable than the expiring revolving credit agreement  or that a new agreement can be completed at all

although the gold consignor has increased the limit to the lesser of i  fine troy ounces or ii million worth of gold  subject to a formula as prescribed by the gold consignment agreement  finlay jewelry is currently limited by the senior indentures to million worth of gold

for the year ended february   the gain or loss on open futures contracts was not material
