item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations terminated merger with utilicorp empire and utilicorp united inc entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of may  which provided for a merger of our company with and into utilicorp  with utilicorp being the surviving corporation 
the merger was conditioned  among other things  upon approvals of various federal and state regulatory agencies  with either company having the right to terminate the merger agreement if all regulatory approvals were not obtained by december  all approvals were not received by this date and utilicorp notified us on january   that it was exercising its right to terminate the merger agreement 
as a result of the termination of the merger by utilicorp  approximately million in merger related expenses that were not tax deductible when incurred by us  became deductible 
this deduction was taken in january  decreasing income tax expense and increasing operating income for the first quarter of by approximately million 
results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of our total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers  from wholesale off system transactions and from miscellaneous sources such as late payment fees and transmission services 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major electric customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total system revenues excluding portion of the interim energy charge that may be refundable to customers 
see discussion below 
kwh sales and revenues for our on system customers increased during primarily due to unseasonably cold temperatures in the first quarter and warmer temperatures during the second quarter  offset by milder temperatures in the last two quarters of customer growth was in residential kwh sales increased with revenues increasing as compared to primarily due to these weather conditions 
commercial kwh sales increased with revenues increasing due to these weather conditions as well as continued increases in business activity throughout our service territory 
industrial classes showed a decrease in kwh sales due to decreased consumption by the manufacturing sector in our service territory during the third and fourth quarters of revenues in these classes were favorably impacted by the increased missouri rates 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased in  reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of our fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
this clause permits the pass through to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
kwh sales and revenues for our on system customers increased during primarily due to above average temperatures in august and september of as well as unseasonably cold temperatures in november and december of customer growth in remained at the same rate as experienced in residential kwh sales increased with revenues increasing as compared to primarily due to these weather conditions 
commercial kwh sales increased with revenues increasing due to these weather conditions as well as increases in business activity throughout our service territory 
industrial classes also showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues because of the increased business activity 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased in  reflecting these weather conditions 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause mentioned above 
on november   we filed a request with the missouri public service commission for a general annual increase in rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
this request sought recovery of expenses resulting from significantly higher natural gas prices than the levels contemplated by our existing rates as well as our investment in the combined cycle unit which was under construction at the state line power plant and other plant additions which had occurred since our last rate increase in september we also filed a request for interim rate relief in february  which was denied in march 
the missouri commission issued a final order on september  the order granted us an annual increase in rates of approximately million  or  effective october  in addition  the order approved an annual interim energy charge iec of approximately million effective october  and expiring two years later 
this iec is per kilowatt hour of customer usage 
the recent extraordinarily high natural gas prices and extreme volatility of natural gas led the missouri commission to allow forecasted fuel costs to be used rather than the traditional historical costs in determining the fuel portion of the rate increase 
at the end of the two year period  the excess money collected from customers  if any  above the greater of the actual and prudently incurred costs or the base cost of fuel and purchased power set in rates  will be refunded to the customers with interest equal to the current prime rate at that time 
at december   we had recorded a liability of approximately million of the iec collected in the fourth quarter of as a provision for rate refunds and are not recognizing that revenue in total electric operating revenue 
as of february   approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dekatherm dth while approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth 
on october   we filed a request with the missouri public service commission for an additional increase in rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  annually to rectify a regulatory clerical error omitting the cost of off system sales in the recent rate order 
the missouri commission  after various proceedings  denied our requests for relief 
we are currently evaluating our options for recovering the previously overlooked expenses as well as other capital investments and increased operating expenses which have occurred since our last rate increase 
on december   we filed a request with the kansas corporation commission for a general annual increase in rates for our kansas electric customers in the amount of  or 
this request seeks to recover costs associated with our investment in state line unit no 
 state line unit no 
and the state line combined cycle unit as well as significant additions to the transmission and distribution systems and operating cost increases which have occurred since our last rate increase in september a hearing is scheduled for june  any rate increase approved as a result of the filing would not become effective until august we cannot predict the amount of any increase which might be granted as a result of this filing 
in addition to sales to our own customers  we sell power to other utilities as available and provide transmission service through our system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during revenues from such off system transactions were approximately million as compared to approximately million in and approximately million during this fluctuation in revenues is primarily the result of our ability to sell power at market based rates with the decrease in revenues during resulting primarily from our peak hour market based rates being substantially lower this summer than in  milder regional weather conditions in the fourth quarter affecting demand and less power available for sale from the state line plant due to the construction of the combined cycle unit during the first half of the year 
see competition below for more information on open access tariffs 
our future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  fuel costs  regulation  the change from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in electric rate levels  and changes in patterns of electric energy use by customers and our ability to receive adequate and timely rate relief 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total purchased power costs decreased by approximately million during reflecting both the decreased demand in the third and fourth quarters of resulting from milder temperatures and the increased generating capability due to the completion of the state line combined cycle unit 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during as compared to primarily reflecting the higher cost of natural gas  increased generation from the new combined cycle unit in the third and fourth quarters and less coal generation due to our asbury plant being out of service for scheduled and unscheduled repairs and maintenance during weeks late in the year 
natural gas prices were higher by during as compared to merger related expenses were million during as compared to million in merger related expenses in were primarily the result of expenses related to severance benefits incurred under our change in control severance pay plan in the first quarter of other operating expenses increased approximately million during primarily due to an actuarially determined adjustment to our fully funded pension benefit expense in the first quarter of  decreased income of approximately million from the pension fund caused by a decline in the value of invested funds during and additions to the bad debt reserve of approximately million during maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during primarily due to payments under our new maintenance contracts entered into in july for the combustion turbines at the energy center and state line power plants 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense caused by increased levels of plant and equipment was partially offset by lower depreciation rates put into effect during the fourth quarter of as a result of the october rate order issued by the missouri commission 
total provision for income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income and by the deductibility of approximately million in merger related expenses discussed above 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes increased approximately million during the year 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total purchased power costs increased by approximately million during reflecting increased demand in the third and fourth quarters of decreased availability of some of our generating units during the third quarter of and escalating natural gas prices which at times made it more economical to purchase power than to run our gas fired units  particularly in september added to the increase in purchased power 
the riverton plant s coal fired unit no 
was out of service for its scheduled fall outage from september to november and unit no 
 also coal fired  was out of service for its scheduled fall outage from september to october the state line plant s unit no 
was taken out of service on september  to begin construction of the combined cycle unit that was placed into commercial operation in june total fuel costs were up approximately million during primarily reflecting increased generation by our gas generation facilities in the fourth quarter of the extremely cold temperatures in december resulted in a significant increase in the price of purchased power  making it more economical for us to run our gas fired turbines 
natural gas prices were higher by during as compared to merger related expenses  which were not tax deductible when they were incurred  were million less during as compared to other operating expenses increased approximately million during  compared to  mainly due to a million addition to the bad debt reserve in the third quarter 
maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during primarily due to decreased maintenance on the combustion turbines at energy center as well as decreased levels of distribution maintenance 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total provision for income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income 
other taxes decreased approximately million during the year 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during  and during although the percentage of afudc compared to earnings applicable to common stock increased in as compared to  this reflected decreased net income in rather than increased afudc 
the amount of afudc actually decreased million in reflecting the completion of the state line combined cycle unit in june 
afudc increased significantly in primarily due to the construction of the state line combined cycle 
see note of notes to financial statements under item other net deductions increased million during as compared to primarily reflecting a loss in the second and third quarters of caused by the marking to market  required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas of option contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result of our use of derivatives to manage our gas commodity risk and our exposure to gas and purchased power cost volatility including hedging and the use of mark to market accounting  revenues and earnings may fluctuate 
although our purpose is to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices and protect earnings  we recognize that if risk is not timely and adequately balanced or if counterparties fail to perform contractual obligations  actual results could differ materially from intended results 
a one time write down of million was taken in the third quarter of for disallowed capital costs related to the construction of the state line combined cycle unit 
these disallowed costs were part of a stipulated agreement between us and the missouri commission in connection with our october rate order 
the net effect on earnings after considering the tax effect on this write down is million 
interest charges on long term debt were virtually the same for as for interest charges on long term debt increased million during as compared to due to the issuance of million of our unsecured senior notes in november commercial paper interest increased million during due to increased usage of short term debt for financing our construction program 
interest related to our trust preferred securities issued on march  added million to total interest charges during interest income decreased million  reflecting lower balances of cash available for investment 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in earnings per share for were negatively impacted by the mild weather in the third and fourth quarters  increased natural gas prices and greater use of gas than in the prior year and the one time non cash charge of million  net of related income taxes  from the write down of the state line construction expenditures 
positively impacting earnings in was the one time tax benefit of approximately million from previously incurred merger related costs and favorable weather conditions in the first and second quarters of excluding million in merger costs for  the one time write down of construction expenditures and the tax benefit from merger expenses  earnings per share would have been 
excluding merger related expenses of million  earnings per share would have been during basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in excluding merger related expenses  earnings per share would have been during compared to in earnings per share  although higher because of favorable weather conditions  increased afudc and decreased merger expenses  were negatively impacted by significantly increased natural gas prices and purchased power costs 
earnings for the first quarter of will reflect an aggregate of million of merger expenses related to severance benefits accrued under our change in control severance pay plan 
competition federal regulation has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
oklahoma and arkansas  however  are the only states in which we operate that have taken action with respect to promoting competition 
legislation in oklahoma originally provided for open competition by july however  the oklahoma legislature overwhelmingly approved legislation in june that indefinitely delays electric restructuring in the state 
approximately of our retail electric revenue for was derived from sales subject to oklahoma regulation 
the arkansas legislature passed a bill in april that called for deregulation of the state s electricity industry as early as january a bill was enacted in february  however  delaying implementation of deregulation until october and giving the arkansas public service commission apsc authority to set further delays in one year increments until october the apsc  after conducting hearings  issued a report in december recommending that the legislature suspend deregulation beyond or repeal the law mandating deregulation 
approximately of our retail electric revenue for was derived from sales subject to arkansas regulation 
we  and all other electric utilities with interstate transmission facilities  operate under ferc regulated open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services at the same rates that the utilities provide themselves 
we and the southwestern power pool spp have filed these open access transmission tariffs covering wholesale transmission services 
under these tariffs  we share revenues received from most of our transmission services with other members of the spp 
there are  however  limited circumstances where our own tariff still applies and we receive of the revenues from the transmission services 
we will continue to operate under the spp tariff until a new tariff is filed as part of the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso  the regional transmission organization  or rto  which we intend to join 
in december  the ferc issued order no 
which encourages the development of rtos 
rtos are designed to control the wholesale transmission services of the utilities in their regions thereby facilitating open and more competitive markets in bulk power 
after the ferc rejected several attempts by the spp to seek rto status  the spp and miso agreed in october to consolidate and form an rto 
in december the ferc approved this newly formed miso as the first rto 
the agreement to consolidate was completed in february this new organization will operate our system as part of an interconnected transmission system encompassing over  megawatts of generation capacity located in states 
miso will collect revenues attributable to the use of each member s transmission system and each member will be able to transmit power purchased  generated for sale or bought for resale in the wholesale market throughout the entire miso system 
although each member will have priority over the use of its own transmission facilities for selling power to its wholesale customers or others  each member will be charged the same uniform transmission rate as other energy suppliers who are able to sell power to them 
we intend to file with the ferc and the utility commissions in the four states in which we operate to transfer control over the operation of our transmission facilities to miso 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  this will have on our off system sales and revenues but it could be material 
even though we have historically been able to generate power relatively inexpensively  other suppliers may be able to offer power at more favorable rates and transmit that power along our system at the same price we pay 
approximately of our electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling 
nonregulated business we are continuing our investments in nonregulated businesses which we commenced in we now lease capacity on our broadband fiber optics network and provide electronic monitored security  decorative lighting and other energy services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ede holdings  inc see item  business general for further information about these nonregulated businesses 
liquidity and capital resources our construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
a breakdown of our construction expenditures is as follows construction expenditures amounts in millions distribution and transmission system additions new construction state line combined cycle unit twin pac aero units energy center additions and replacements asbury additions and replacements riverton and iatan fiber optics general and other additions total the amounts in the table do not include million of capitalized spare parts for the state line combined cycle plant  million of plant retirements and million in capital leases and utility land transferred to land held for future use 
approximately of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations 
the other of such requirements were satisfied from short term borrowings and proceeds from our sale of common stock in an underwritten public offering on december  we estimate that our construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  we anticipate that we will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to our distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these construction expenditure estimates also include approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  for two twin pac aero units at the empire energy center 
on october   we entered into an agreement to purchase two twin pac aero units with generating capacity of megawatts each to be installed at the empire energy center 
an initial payment of million was made at that time 
the first unit is scheduled to be delivered in october and is expected to be operational by april the second unit is scheduled to be delivered in october and is expected to be operational by april contracts with other vendors will be entered into for construction and installation of the units 
we estimate that internally generated funds will provide at least of the borrowing funds required in for construction expenditures 
as in the past  we intend to utilize short term debt to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction and repay such borrowings with the proceeds of sales of public offerings of long term debt or common stock  including common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and from internally generated funds 
we will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
as of december   we had lines of credit aggregating million 
our lines of credit each currently contain certain contingencies which affected our rights and obligations thereunder 
in the event that the credit rating on our first mortgage bonds falls below bbb standard poor s or baa moody s for a million line of credit or baa for a million line of credit  our obligations under our lines of credit either could become immediately due and payable or are no longer available to us 
our credit ratings are discussed below 
further  one of our lines of credit contains a restriction on availability in the event that we fail to maintain total funded debt to capital where capital is defined as total funded debt plus equity capital including our  of trust preferred securities less than 
we are currently in compliance with this ratio 
this line of credit is also subject to cross default with our other indebtedness in excess of  in the aggregate 
we are currently in the process of seeking to amend and or replace these lines of credit so as to remove the credit rating conditions 
see note of notes to financial statements regarding our lines of credit 
in addition  restrictions in our mortgage bond indenture could also affect our liquidity 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the fifteen months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
the mortgage provides an exception from this earnings requirement in certain instances  relating to the issuance of new first mortgage bonds against first mortgage bonds which have been  or are to be  retired 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december  do not permit us to issue new first mortgage bonds based on this test 
however  we have not financed with bonds since and have used unsecured long term debt rather than first mortgage bonds 
see note to notes to financial statements for more information on the mortgage bond indenture 
in february  the sec declared effective our million shelf registration statement covering our unsecured debt securities and preferred securities of two newly created trusts of which million remains available for issuance 
on march   we sold two million trust preferred securities liquidation amount per preferred security in a public underwritten offering 
this issuance generated proceeds of million and issuance costs of million 
holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled to receive distributions at an annual rate of of the liquidation amount 
quarterly payments of dividends by the trust  as well as payments of principal  are made from cash received from corresponding payments made by us on the million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debentures due march   issued by us to the trust  and held by the trust  as assets 
our interest payments on the debentures are tax deductible by us 
we have effectively guaranteed the payments due on the outstanding trust preferred securities 
the net proceeds of this offering were added to our general funds and were used to repay short term indebtedness 
on december   we sold to the public in an underwritten offering  newly issued shares of our common stock for approximately million 
proceeds from the sale of the common stock were added to our general funds and used to repay short term debt  including debt incurred in connection with our construction program 
on november   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our unsecured senior notes  the net proceeds of which were added to our general funds and were used to repay short term indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption and in connection with our construction program 
following announcement of the merger with utilicorp  the credit ratings for our first mortgage bonds other than the pollution control bonds were placed on credit watch with downward implications by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
standard poor s removed the credit watch but kept the downward implication in january after the merger was terminated 
in may  moody s investors service lowered the credit ratings of our first mortgage bonds other than the pollution control bonds to baa from a  and on our senior unsecured debt to baa from a this downgrade was primarily due to the risk to our credit profile associated with our ability to obtain necessary rate relief from the missouri public service commission to recover our capital expenditures associated with the construction of the combined cycle unit at our state line power plant and our increased operating expenses primarily caused by escalating natural gas prices 
as of december   the ratings for our securities were as follows moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds baa a first mortgage bonds pollution control series aaa aaa senior notes baa bbb commercial paper p a trust preferred securities baa bbb these ratings indicate the agency s assessment of our ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends and principal on these securities 
the lower the rating the higher the cost of the securities when they are sold 
ratings below investment grade may also impair our ability to issue short term debt as described above  commercial paper or other securities or make the marketing of such securities more difficult 
contractual obligations set forth below is information summarizing our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt w o discount capital lease obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations critical accounting policies set forth below are certain accounting policies that are considered by management to be critical and to possibly involve significant risk  which means that they typically require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain other accounting policies may also require assumptions that could cause actual results to be different than anticipated results 
pensions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  our pension expense includes a calculation of amortization of unrecognized net gain loss which was changed in as a result of the settlement order in our missouri rate case 
previously the current year calculation of net gains or losses was amortized over five years 
the new calculation requires the use of an average of the previous five years gain or loss  which is then amortized over five years 
the result for year was an increase of  in pension income 
provision for refunds 
as discussed under operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales above  the missouri commission in its september rate case order approved an annual iec of approximately million effective october  and expiring two years later 
at the end of the two year period  the excess money collected from customers under the iec  if any  above the greater of the actual and prudently incurred costs or the base cost of fuel and purchased power set in rates  will be refunded to the customers with interest equal to the current prime rate at that time 
at december   we had recorded a liability of approximately million of the iec collected in the fourth quarter of as a provision for rate refunds and are not recognizing that revenue in total electric operating revenue 
hedging activities 
we currently engage in hedging activities in an effort to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties for our future natural gas requirements under a set of predetermined percentages that lock in prices in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and gain predictability  thus protecting earnings 
we recognize that if risk is not timely and adequately balanced or if counterparties fail to perform contractual obligations  actual results could differ materially from intended results 
regulatory assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  our financial statements reflect ratemaking policies prescribed by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over us ferc and four states 
certain expenses and credits  normally reflected in income as incurred  are recognized when included in rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
as such  we have recorded certain regulatory assets which are expected to result in future revenues as these costs are recovered through the ratemaking process 
historically  all costs of this nature which are determined by our regulators to have been prudently incurred have been recoverable through rates in the course of normal ratemaking procedures and we believe that the items detailed below will be afforded similar treatment 
we recorded  in regulatory assets and  in income taxes as a regulatory liability for these amounts are being amortized over periods of up to years 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for detailed information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
we continually assess the recoverability of our regulatory assets 
under current accounting standards  regulatory assets and liabilities are eliminated through a charge or credit  respectively  to earnings if and when it is no longer probable that such amounts will be recovered through future revenues 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements eliminate the amortization of purchased goodwill and instead require an annual review of goodwill and intangibles for impairment or when a change or event occurs that indicates goodwill may be impaired 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted no later than the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and establishes specific criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
we had no recorded goodwill as of december  but will continue to evaluate the total impact of the adoption of these statements on our financial statements and financial reporting 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
this statement establishes standards for accounting and reporting for legal and constructive obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  establishing new standards for accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement eliminates the requirement under sfas to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we will continue to evaluate the total impact of the adoption of these statements on our financial statements and financial reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to a change in the value of a physical asset or financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates or commodity prices 
we handle market risk in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of significant financing through our issuance of commercial paper 
we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure to a certain percentage of total capitalization  as set by policy  and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
see notes and of notes to financial statements under item for further information 
if market interest rates average more in than in  our interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by approximately  this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our commercial paper balances as of december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of coal  natural gas  and electricity and employ established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations
