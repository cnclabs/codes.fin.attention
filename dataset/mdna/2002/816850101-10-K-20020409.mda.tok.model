item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this form k contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
we assume no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k 
overview we design  produce and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer  communications and industrial markets 
our products are designed into a wide variety of end applications  including notebook and desktop computers  computer gaming systems  personal digital assistants pdas  cellular phones  wireline networks  wireless base stations and automated test equipment ate 
products within the communications market include products for local area networks  metro and wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial applications include ate  medical devices and factory automation systems 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including acer  agilent  cisco  compaq  dell  first international  ibm  intel  microstar  motorola  samsung and sony 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  receipt by the customer has been confirmed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many large commercial customers include terms in their purchase orders which provide liberal cancellation provisions 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
sales made directly to original equipment manufacturers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on three reportable segments standard semiconductor products  rectifier and assembly products  and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  high performance  advanced communications and human input system management product lines 
the rectifier and assembly products segment includes our line of assembly and rectifier devices which are the remaining products from our original founding as a supplier into the military and aerospace market 
the other products segment is made up of other custom integrated circuit ic and foundry sales 
our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
several of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  malaysia  the philippines and germany 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon was manufactured in china 
during fiscal years  and  foreign sales constituted   and  respectively  of our net sales 
approximately three fourths of foreign sales are to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining are to customers in europe 
one of our strategies is to expand our business through strategic acquisitions 
over the past several years  we have made several small acquisitions in order to increase our pool of skilled technical personnel and penetrate new market segments  such as high performance  advanced communications and system management devices 
these acquisitions include usar systems incorporated  practical sciences  inc  acapella limited  and edge semiconductor 
the acquisitions of usar  acapella and edge were accounted for as poolings of interests 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decline of compared to million for fiscal year overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year  as were the end markets that we serve 
the weakest end markets for fiscal year were the industrial market and the wireline portion of the communications market 
sales of our standard semiconductor products segment shrank in fiscal year rectifier and assembly products sales declined and our other products segment declined in fiscal year standard semiconductor products represented about of net sales in fiscal year the decline in sales in this segment was due to both weak industry conditions and weak demand from customers 
only the power management product line within the standard semiconductor products segment grew in the year  while all other product lines in the segment declined 
the power management product line benefited from strength in computer and wireless applications 
the largest absolute dollar declines in net sales within the segment were in our protection and high performance product lines 
the protection product line was hurt by weakness in the wireline segment of the communications market and price declines in portable applications 
high performance product line sales were impacted by a severe downturn in the ate portion of the industrial market 
sales of our rectifier and assembly products segment declined due to weak industry conditions and a strategic focus on proprietary products 
other products declined as a result of a strategic de emphasis of custom and foundry services 
we plan to eventually exit the custom and foundry product offerings 
in fiscal year  favorable market conditions benefited all three of our reportable segments 
the standard products segment was most benefited by a large increase in sales of our high performance and protection product lines 
on an absolute dollar basis  these two product lines had the largest impact on our increase in net sales 
sales of these two product lines were benefited by strength in the communications end market and the test equipment area of the industrial end market 
our power management product line also part of our standard products segment sales grew only slightly in fiscal year due in part to weak demand from computer related customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower sales levels in all three of our reportable segments and one time cost of million for the write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter 
our gross margin was for fiscal year ended january   compared to a gross margin of for fiscal year ended january  the write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products during the second quarter was the result of a critical review we conducted during that quarter 
a severe industry downturn and a related drop in demand from end customers made certain inventories excess and obsolete  and certain product lines non strategic 
of the million write down of inventory and discontinuation of certain products  million was associated with the standard products segment   with the rectifier and assembly products segment and  with the other products segment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a one time gain of  on the sale of inventory of the standard products segment that had been reserved during the second quarter 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses were million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales 
the decline in absolute dollars of operating costs and expenses was the result of cost cutting measures  which included headcount reductions and declines in variable expense items 
despite an absolute drop in operating costs and expenses  these costs went up as a percent of net sales due to the much lower revenue base 
operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time costs of million associated with an approximate person reduction in headcount made in the first half of the year and one time costs of  associated with a pending superfund settlement 
as of january    of the one time headcount reduction costs have yet to be paid out in cash 
operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal year  down from operating income of million in fiscal year operating income was impacted by a decline in net sales  a drop to gross margin and one time costs of million related to headcount reductions and a pending superfund settlement 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment declined in fiscal year operating income in the standard segment was benefited by an increase in power management product line sales and was most hurt by large declines in our protection and high performance product lines 
in fiscal year  the high performance product line had operating margins above our consolidate average 
operating income for the rectifier and assembly products segment increased by  while the other products segment decreased in fiscal year rectifier and assembly products operating income improved due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses associated with this segment 
other products operating margin reflected poor efficiencies associated with a lower sales level 
operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment in fiscal year was benefited by a significant increase in our protection and high performance product line sales  which had above corporate average operating margins 
operating income for the rectifier and assembly products segment increased in fiscal year due to a shift in manufacturing to our lower cost facility in mexico and reduced overhead 
other products operating income decreased due to lower gross margins and underutilized overhead 
interest and other income 
net interest and other income of million was realized in fiscal year for fiscal year  interest and other income was million 
other income and expenses is primarily interest income from investments and interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
the decline in interest and other income in fiscal year was mostly due to lower rates of return on our investments as compared to the prior year 
provision for taxes 
provision for income taxes  excluding the tax effect of extraordinary gains  was million for fiscal year ended january   compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the effective tax rate for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the decline is due to increased sales through foreign based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions 
extraordinary gain 
for fiscal year  we reported an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax  in the amount of million 
the gross amount of the gain was million and the associated tax was  the gain was a result of our repurchase of  of our  face value convertible subordinated notes below their stated par value 
we had no extraordinary gain in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was due in part to favorable market conditions in the overall semiconductor industry and the growth in sales into the communications and industrial end market 
sales of our standard semiconductor products segment grew in fiscal year rectifier and assembly products sales increased and our other products segment grew in fiscal year standard semiconductor products represented about of net sales in fiscal year  while rectifier and assembly products sales were and our other products were of net sales 
favorable market conditions benefited all three of our reportable segments 
the standard products segment was most benefited by a large increase in sales of our high performance and protection product lines 
on an absolute dollar basis  these two product lines had the largest impact on our increase in net sales 
sales of these two product lines were benefited by strength in the communications end market and the test equipment area of the industrial end market 
our power management product line also part of our standard products segment sales grew only slightly in fiscal year due in part to weak demand from computer related customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the prior year  a increase 
our gross margin was for fiscal year this compared to a gross margin of for fiscal year the improvement is attributed to increased operating efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels  higher revenue contribution from products introduced in the eighteen months ending prior to the end of the period  and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin product lines 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year were million  or of net sales 
operating costs and expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were lower for fiscal year than previous levels due to higher shipment rates and greater efficiencies 
operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time costs of  associated with the december acquisition of usar systems 
operating income 
operating income was million in fiscal year  up from operating income of million in fiscal year operating income was impacted by a increase in net sales and an increase to gross margin from in the prior year 
fiscal year operating income was impacted by a one time acquisition cost of  operating income for the standard semiconductor products segment in fiscal year was million  an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
operating income in the standard segment was benefited by a significant increase in our protection and high performance product line sales  which had above our consolidated average operating margins 
operating income for the rectifier and assembly products increased to million in fiscal year  up from  in fiscal year the increase was largely due to a shift in manufacturing to our lower cost facility in mexico and reduced overhead 
other products operating income was million in fiscal year  up from million in the prior year  as a result of better overhead utilization and reduced costs associated with this segment 
interest and other income 
interest and other income of million was realized in fiscal year  up significantly from interest and other income of million in fiscal year interest and other income in fiscal year is comprised primarily of interest income 
for fiscal year  interest and other income and expense was primarily interest income 
the significant increase in interest and other income in fiscal year over the prior year was income attributable to cash provided by the february issuance of million of our convertible subordinated notes 
interest income from investments made with these proceeds exceeded the fixed interest expense paid to bond holders 
provision for taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year  an effective tax rate of 
provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year  an effective tax rate of 
the decline is due to increased sales through foreign based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions

provision for taxes net income before extraordinary items extraordinary gain  net of tax net income liquidity and capital resources we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets and liabilities 
on february   we completed a private offering of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at the rate of per annum and are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are due in and redeemable in we have used the net proceeds of the notes offering  in part  for general corporate purposes  including working capital  expansion of sales  marketing and customer service capabilities  and product development 
in addition  we may use a portion of the net proceeds from the notes offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
as of january   we had working capital of million  compared with million as of january  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of january  was to  compared to to as of january  the drop in working capital as of january  was mostly the result of an increase in investments with maturities greater than one year 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year net income for fiscal year was reduced by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
net operating cash flows were positively impacted by net income of million and by a decrease in receivables and inventories  tax benefit from stock option exercises  income taxes payable and other assets 
these were partially offset by increases in deferred income taxes  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and other liabilities 
investing activities used million for fiscal year compared to million used in fiscal year investing activities for both periods consists of increases in temporary investments  purchases of long term investments  and capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal year included proceeds of  from the sale of assets 
our financing activities used million during fiscal year and added million in the prior year 
financing activities for fiscal year reflect the proceeds from stock option exercises  which were more than offset by cash used to repurchase common stock and long term debt 
financing activities for fiscal year reflect the proceeds  net of related fees  from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes and cash provided by stock option exercises and other long term financing items 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing activities and do not have any special purpose entities 
as of january   we have approximately million in operating lease commitments that extend over a six year period 
the portion of these operating lease payments due during the coming fiscal year is less than million 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under any credit facility 
contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have made significant expenditures during the past five years 
these investments aimed at developing new products  including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment  will continue 
we intend to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments 
purchases of new capital equipment were made primarily to improve internal computer systems and expand manufacturing capacity 
funding for these purchases was made from our operating cash flows and cash reserves 
we have made significant investments in product and process technology 
we believe that sales generating cash flows  together with the proceeds of the notes offering and cash reserves  are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policy  we identified the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or objective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation and use of estimates 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financials statements and at relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis 
recently issued accounting standards in june and june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides additional guidance for the application of sfas no 
for certain transactions 
we adopted the statement in fiscal year and the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the fasb recently approved two statements sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements provide guidance on the accounting for business combinations  requires all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method  discontinue amortization of goodwill  define when and how intangible assets are amortized  and require an annual impairment test for goodwill 
we have adopted these statements effective january  we believe that adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we plan to adopt this statement effective january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provision of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas also resolves significant implementation issues related to statement we have adopted this statement effective with the fiscal year beginning january  we are currently reviewing these standards to determine the impact on our results of operations and financial position  however  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  exist in nondollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the nondollar denominated currencies are principally euro and british pounds sterling 
additionally  certain of our current and long term liabilities are denominated principally in british pounds sterling currency  which are also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
interest rate risk as of january   we had million in long term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of per annum 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
a significant decline in interest rates would reduce the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments
