item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously and materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we face legal and regulatory uncertainties that threaten our ability to conduct our business  increase our cost of doing business and divert substantial management time away from our operations 
virtually all of our business relates to gaming activities on native american lands 
these activities are subject to federal regulation under the johnson act  igra  the rules and regulations adopted by gaming commissions established by native american tribes to regulate gaming  and by state and local authorities to the extent the gaming activities constitute class iii gaming 
the johnson act broadly defines illegal games and illegal equipment to include any machine or mechanical device designed primarily for gambling  that  when operated  delivers money to a player as the result of the application of an element of chance 
trying to accommodate this broad definition of illegal games and illegal equipment with the provisions of igra that are expressly intended to encourage the legal use by tribes of class ii technological aids and equipment has created a continuing source of friction between regulatory authorities and vendors of class ii games and eps 
effective june   the nigc adopted final rules defining the terms electronic  computer or other technological aids  electronic or electromechanical facsimile and games similar to bingo as used in igra  see business governmental regulation 
which may over time provide guidance and greater clarity in this area 
to date  there have been no decisions  interpretive opinions or other guidance issued under these new rules  and we are not able to predict what effect  if any  these new rules will have on our business 
all native american tribes are required by igra to adopt ordinances to regulate gaming as a condition of their right to conduct gaming on native american lands 
these ordinances often include the establishment of gaming commissions that make their own judgment about whether an activity is class ii or class iii gaming 
generally  this independent judgment has been exercised for games introduced into the market prior to any determination of legality by the nigc 
historically  when the nigc has determined that an activity is class iii gaming after it has been introduced  tribes have either been unwilling to continue the activity or have litigated the matter in federal court 
individual states are also becoming increasingly proactive in attempting to regulate native american gaming conducted within their borders 
state agencies often make their own assessment of whether an activity is class ii or class iii gaming independent of the nigc  igra  and federal and native american governments 
some fundamental issues relating to the scope and intent of igra  the jurisdiction and authority of the nigc  other federal agencies  state authorities and native american governments  and the regulation of gaming on native american lands remain unresolved and ambiguous 
as a result  the legality of our activities could be subject to regulatory challenges  litigation  and enforcement actions by multiple regulatory bodies 
any such action could materially and adversely affect our ability to install and operate our games and eps  could be costly to defend and could divert management s time and attention away from our operations 
we cannot assure you that new laws and regulations relating to our business will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations will not be amended or reinterpreted in a manner adverse to our business 
any regulatory change could materially and adversely affect the installation and use of existing and additional player stations  games and systems and our ability to generate revenues from some or all of our class ii games 
regulatory uncertainty also increases our cost of doing business 
we dedicate significant time and incur significant expense on new game development without any assurance that the nigc or other federal  state and local agencies or native american governments will agree that each of our games meets applicable regulatory requirements 
we also devote significant time and expense in dealing with federal  state and native american agencies having jurisdiction over native american gaming and in complying with the various regulatory regimes that govern our business 
if the nigc is successful in its pending assertion that megananza and its family of games are class iii games  we could be required to replace those games  and our business could be adversely affected 
on april   we received an advisory opinion from the deputy general counsel of the nigc  stating that megananza and its related family of games were class iii games as defined by igra 
the advisory opinion relied heavily upon two factors in reaching its conclusion 
first  that the ball draw for each megananza bingo game occurred prior to  rather than after  the sale of bingo cards to players and  second  upon proposed rules published by the nigc on march  that would have changed the definitions of legally permissible technological aids and illegal electronic facsimiles used in the play of class ii gaming in a manner adverse to our method of operating our games 
we first introduced megananza in january  and by the quarter ended march   megananza accounted for approximately of our total revenues and was our most successful game 
on april   we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma against the nigc seeking a judicial declaration that two versions of megananza are class ii games 
both versions operate in what is called nonstandard sequence  meaning that the ball draw occurs before bingo cards are sold to players 
on june   the nigc  represented by and acting through the department of justice  or doj  filed a motion to dismiss the case  claiming the court lacked jurisdiction on various procedural grounds 
on june   the nigc adopted final rules on the definitions of legally permissible technological aids and illegal electronic facsimiles used in the play of class ii gaming 
this action was based on a two to one vote of the commission  with the nigc chairman in the minority 
these new rules differed significantly from the rules initially proposed by the nigc on march   which the deputy general counsel of the nigc had relied upon in her april  advisory opinion finding megananza to be class iii gaming 
we believe the final rules support our current method of game operation  including the megananza family of games 
nevertheless  under the rules of igra that grant the nigc chairman exclusive authority to bring enforcement actions against tribes believed by the chairman to be conducting illegal gaming  on june   the chairman issued a notice of violation  or nov  to our largest customer  threatening the tribe with significant fines and penalties unless it immediately ceased the play of megananza 
in view of the threat raised by the nov  our largest customer immediately ceased play of megananza and  together with two of our other major tribal customers  sought to join us in our pending action against the nigc 
we and the tribes further sought an immediate injunction against the nigc from pursuing the existing nov or taking any other enforcement actions against these tribes or any of our other native american customers 
on june   the court granted the relief we requested and enjoined the nigc from issuing or further pursuing any notices of violation  penalties  or closure orders with respect to the megananza family of games 
on september   the court granted the doj s motion to dismiss our case for lack of jurisdiction 
as a consequence of the dismissal  the previous injunction granted by the court was dissolved  and the nigc was no longer enjoined from issuing additional novs 
however  the term of the nigc chairman who had originally issued the nov to our largest customer had expired  so  under the terms of igra  the nigc  in the absence of a chairman  had no one with the authority to issue an nov 
no additional novs have been issued through the date of filing of this annual report 
a new nigc chairman began his term on november  we cannot predict what actions  if any  this new chairman will take with respect to megananza  including whether or not the new chairman will issue additional novs 
our major customer that received the nov is currently appealing the issuance of the nov before the nigc under an appeal process established under igra 
if the nigc continues to prosecute its case against megananza and is ultimately successful in having megananza found to be a class iii game  our customers would likely discontinue the play of megananza and seek alternative games and systems from us or our competitors 
on may   prior to the nov issuance  we had  megananza and no reel time bingo eps in operation 
as of september   we had  megananza and  reel time bingo eps in operation 
reel time bingo is a standard sequence bingo game  meaning that the ball draw occurs after the bingo cards are sold 
we expect to eventually replace megananza with reel time bingo and other successor games  but if megananza is discontinued before we are able to do so  we could experience a loss of revenues and market share  and our business could be adversely affected 
our future performance will depend on our ability to introduce new games and enhancements that are widely accepted and played 
our revenue growth has been driven primarily by our technological innovations and the increased number and use of our installed base of eps 
our new generation gaming platform allows us to produce games that play faster than our legacy games and generate increased revenues for our customers and for us 
in january  we introduced megananza  our first game based on the new generation platform 
in june  we introduced our second game based on the new generation platform  reel time bingo  a high speed standard sequence bingo game 
our future performance will depend on our ability to successfully and cost effectively develop and introduce new and enhanced games that will be widely accepted both by our tribal customers and their end users 
our new generation platform enables us to more effectively launch new games that we believe are more entertaining for end users  thus providing us and our customers with greater revenues 
however  we may experience delays in game development in the future  or we may not be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new games or game enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
in addition  our new games may be subject to challenge by the nigc or the doj based on igra  the johnson act or some other regulatory mandate 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new games or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing regulatory  legal or market conditions or customer requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  our business would be seriously harmed 
our business is subject to various licensing regimes imposed by gaming regulatory authorities 
we have obtained all state licenses  lottery board licenses  native american gaming commission licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming activities 
these include a license from the state of washington to sell class iii video lottery systems  licenses from the lottery boards of the states of texas  colorado and mississippi  and the district of columbia  and licenses from all applicable native american gaming commissions 
we cannot assure you that new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
the suspension  revocation  non renewal or limitation of any of our licenses would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependant upon a few customers who are based in oklahoma 
for the year ended september   three tribes in oklahoma accounted for approximately  and of our gaming revenues 
the significant concentration of our customers in oklahoma means that n local economic changes may adversely affect our customers  and therefore our business  more suddenly and disproportionately than would changes in national economic conditions  and n our business would be materially and adversely affected if oklahoma were to adopt class iii gaming by compacts with our oklahoma customers 
the loss of any of these tribes as our customers would have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors we do not rely upon the term of our customer contracts to retain the business of our customers 
our expansion into non native american gaming activities will present new challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
our growth strategy includes selling our games and technology into segments of the gaming industry other than native american gaming  principally the charity bingo market and new jurisdictions authorizing video lottery terminals 
in may  the new york lottery notified us that we had been selected as the winning vendor in a competitive procurement to provide the central system for video lottery games to be operated at new york state racetracks 
we do not believe that these activities are currently subject to a nationwide regulatory system such as the one created by igra  and regulation is on a state by state basis 
in addition  federal laws relating to gaming  such as the johnson act  which regulates slot machines and similar gambling devices  would also apply to new video lottery jurisdictions absent authorized state law exemptions 
if we were to expand into these new markets  we would expect to encounter legal and regulatory uncertainties similar to those we face in our native american gaming business 
successful growth in accordance with this strategy may require us to make certain changes to our games to ensure that they comply with applicable regulatory regimes and may require us to obtain additional licenses 
importantly  in certain jurisdictions and for certain venues  our ability to enter these markets will depend on effecting changes to existing laws and regulatory regimes 
the ability to effect these changes is subject to a great degree of uncertainty and may never be achieved 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in entering into other segments of the gaming industry 
generally  our selling games and technology into new market segments involves a number of uncertainties  including n whether our resources and expertise will enable us to effectively operate and grow in such new markets  n whether our internal processes and controls continue to function effectively within these new segments  n whether we have enough experience to accurately predict revenues and expenses in these new segments  and n whether entering such segments will divert management attention and resources from our traditional business 
if we are unable to effectively develop and operate within these segments  then entering into these new segments could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we may not be able to obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such new lines of business 
we compete for customers and end users with other vendors of class ii and class iii games 
we also compete for end users with other forms of entertainment 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop new game themes and systems that appeal to end users 
we compete with other class ii vendors for customers  primarily on the basis of the amount of profit our gaming products generate for our customers in relation to gaming products offered by other vendors 
we believe that the most important factor influencing our customers product selection is the appeal of those products to end users 
this appeal has a direct effect on the volume of play by end users  and drives the amount of revenues generated for and by our customers 
our ability to remain competitive depends primarily on our ability to continuously develop new game themes and systems that appeal to end users and to introduce those game themes and systems in a timely manner 
in addition  our new or modified gaming products that are intended for the class ii market must be designed and operated to meet the requirements of class ii gaming 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop and introduce appealing new game themes and systems that meet the emerging requirements of class ii gaming in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop games similar to our class ii games 
as the class ii market expands and the legal and regulatory uncertainties regarding class ii gaming are resolved  we expect to see increased competition in the class ii market  including competition from class iii vendors  many of whom have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
increased competition could have a materially adverse affect on our ability to sell our products  generate revenue and maintain our profit margins 
if our competitors seek to compete with us by allocating a greater share of gambling proceeds to the hall operators  then we may be forced to do the same  which could result in lower net revenues from our eps 
given the limitations placed on class ii gaming  we may not be able to successfully compete in gaming jurisdictions and facilities where slot machines  table games and other forms of class iii gaming are permitted 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  an expansion of class iii gaming or internet and other account wagering gaming services  which allow end users to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and to play traditional casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
changes in regulation or regulatory interpretations could require us to modify the terms of our contracts with customers 
the nigc has considered the provisions of the agreements under which we provide our class ii games  equipment and services and has determined that these agreements are service contracts and are not management contracts 
management contracts are subject to additional regulatory requirements and oversight 
our contracts could be subject to further review at any time 
any further review of these agreements by the nigc could require substantial modification to our agreements and result in their redesignation as management contracts  which could materially and adversely affect the terms on which we conduct our business 
we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions or by jointly developing or expanding gaming and related facilities with our customers 
we have limited experience with these activities and may not realize a satisfactory return  if any  on our investment  and we could lose some or all of our investment 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may acquire other complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we are exploring the possibility of the joint development of gaming and related facilities on native american land where we can install our games and eps 
we also may seek to enter into strategic relationships and provide financing and development services for new or expanded gaming and related facilities for our customers 
we currently have no binding agreements to acquire any third party or to provide any financing to our customers for the development or expansion of their facilities 
we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  strategic relationship or financing would be realized 
we may not be able to complete or integrate future acquisitions successfully 
in connection with one or more of those transactions  we may n issue additional equity securities which would dilute stockholders  n extend secured and unsecured credit which may not be repaid  n incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay  n incur contingent liabilities  and n integrate additional employees and fixed assets that we must maintain 
we have limited experience in these types of activities 
accordingly  an acquisition or a strategic relationship  development effort or financing may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  financial risks or required expenditures that could adversely affect our liquidity 
it may also divert the time and distract the attention of our management that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
if we provide financing or development services to our customers  we may not realize a satisfactory return  if any  on our investment and we could lose some or all of our investment 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or avoiding claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  license agreements and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights and technology  but these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
we rely to a greater extent upon proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position 
insofar as we rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and innovation  there is no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technology or that secrecy will not be breached 
the issuance of a patent does not necessarily mean that our technology does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to infringement claims from other parties 
problems with patents or other rights could increase the cost of our products or delay or preclude new product development and commercialization 
if infringement claims against us are valid  we may seek licenses that might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
litigation could be costly and time consuming  but may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in the defense of any claims relating to the proprietary rights of others or in asserting claims against others 
we rely on software licensed from third parties and technology provided by third party vendors  the loss of which could increase our costs and delay software shipments 
we also rely on technology provided by third party vendors which  if disrupted  could suspend play on some of our eps 
we integrate various third party software products as components of our software 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our software shipments 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 
we also rely on the technology of third party vendors  such as telecommunication providers  to operate betnet 
a serious or sustained disruption to the provisions of these services could result in some of our eps being non operational for the duration of the disruption  which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from those player stations 
we do not rely upon the term of our customer contracts to retain the business of our customers 
our contracts with our customers are on a year to year or multi year basis and we have no written contract with our largest customer 
we do not rely upon the stated term of our customer contracts to retain the business of our customers 
we rely instead upon providing competitively superior eps  games and systems to give our customers the incentive to continue to do business with us 
at any point in time  a significant portion of our business is subject to non renewal  which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
if our key personnel leave us  our business will be significantly adversely affected 
we depend on the continued performance of the members of our senior management team and our technology team 
gordon t 
graves  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  announced his intention to step down as our chief executive officer at the conclusion of our next annual meeting of shareholders  scheduled for february  mr 
graves intends to remain our chairman and will participate in all meetings of the executive committee of our officers 
clifton e 
lind  currently our president and chief operating officer  will also become our chief executive officer 
if we were to lose the services of any of our senior officers or our directors or any member of our technology team  and cannot find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
enforcement of remedies or contracts against native american tribes could be difficult 
governing and native american law 
federally recognized native american tribes are independent governments  subordinate to the united states  with sovereign powers  except as those powers may have been limited by treaty or by the united states congress 
native american power to enact their own laws to regulate gaming is an exercise of native american sovereignty  as recognized by igra 
native american tribes maintain their own governmental systems and often their own judicial systems 
native american tribes have the right to tax persons and enterprises conducting business on native american lands  and also have the right to require licenses and to impose other forms of regulation and regulatory fees on persons and businesses operating on their lands 
native american tribes  as sovereign nations  are generally subject only to federal regulation 
although congress may regulate native american tribes  states do not have the authority to regulate native american tribes unless such authority has been specifically granted by congress 
state laws generally do not directly apply to native american tribes and activities taking place on native american lands  unless the tribe has a specific agreement or compact with the state or federal government allowing for the application of state law 
in the absence of a conflicting federal or properly authorized state law  native american law governs 
our contracts with native american customers provide that the law of the state in which a tribe is located will be the governing law of those contracts 
we cannot assure you  however  that these choice of law clauses are enforceable 
sovereign immunity  applicable courts 
native american tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from suit similar to that of the states and the united states 
in order to sue a native american tribe or an agency or instrumentality of a native american tribe  the native american tribe must have effectively waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute 
our contracts with native american customers include a limited waiver of each tribe s sovereign immunity and provide that any dispute regarding interpretation  performance or enforcement shall be submitted to  and resolved by  arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association  and that any award  determination  order or relief resulting from such arbitration is binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction 
in the event that such waiver of sovereign immunity is held to be ineffective  we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against a tribe 
these rights and remedies include  but are not limited to  our right to enter native american lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribe party to that contract 
if a native american tribe has effectively waived its sovereign immunity  there exists an issue as to the forum in which a lawsuit can be brought against the tribe 
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and generally do not have jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to native americans 
federal courts may have jurisdiction if a federal question is raised by the suit  which is unlikely in a typical contract dispute 
diversity of citizenship  another common basis for federal court jurisdiction  is not generally present in a suit against a tribe because a native american tribe is not considered a citizen of any state 
accordingly  in most commercial disputes with tribes  the jurisdiction of the federal courts  which are courts of limited jurisdiction  may be difficult or impossible to obtain 
there can be no assurance that we could effectively enforce any arbitration decision 
we may incur prize payouts in excess of game revenues 
our contracts with our native american customers relating to our legacy and new generation platform games provide that our customers receive  on a daily basis  an agreed percentage of gross gaming revenues based upon an assumed level of prize payouts  rather than the actual level of prize payouts 
this can result in our paying our customers amounts greater than our customers percentage share of the actual hold per day 
in addition  because the prizes awarded in our games are based upon assumptions as to the number of players in each game and statistical assumptions as to the frequency of winners  we may experience on any day  or over short periods of time  a game deficit where the total aggregate amount of prizes paid exceeds aggregate game revenues 
if we have to make any excess payments to customers or experience a game deficit over any statistically relevant period of time  we are contractually entitled to adjust the rates of prize payout to end users in order to recover any deficit 
we cannot assure you that  in the future  we will not miscalculate our statistical assumptions or for other reasons experience abnormally high rates of jackpot prize wins which may materially and adversely affect our cash flow on a temporary or long term basis and which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
any disruption in our network or telecommunications services could affect our ability to operate our games  which would result in reduced revenues and customer down time 
if we lose the services of one or more of our telecommunications providers for any reason  we could experience disruption in our network availability and our games may experience down time as a result 
this disruption to our business could result in a decrease in our revenue from the loss of play 
our network is susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  break ins  cyber attacks and similar events 
we have multiple site back up for our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme weather conditions  often deter our end users from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent the sites where our games are installed 
if any of the sites where our games are installed were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if the sites in oklahoma where a significant number of our games are installed were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business 
the demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers disposable incomes  and thus a decline in general economic conditions may lead to our end users having less discretionary income with which to wager 
this could cause a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our products and services class ii games and systems 
we provide the class ii native american gaming market with linked  interactive electronic games and related online systems and player stations 
these games  systems and eps include n flexible gaming platforms that enable us to operate and regularly launch new game engines  n flexible game engines that enable us to display the same underlying bingo game in a variety of ways  n high speed  interactive class ii bingo games designed and developed by us that are intended to provide our end users with an entertaining gaming experience  n eps that are linked via betnet  thereby enabling us to rapidly communicate our games to end users  broaden end user participation in the same game throughout the country and monitor the performance of our network in real time  and n information services that allow our customers to monitor their gaming activities and to improve service to our end users 
to keep our product offerings fresh and take advantage of advances in technology that improve the quality of our systems and the level of revenues generated  we regularly introduce new high speed  interactive class ii bingo games into the market 
since our inception  we have produced megabingo  a live  minute paper bingo game featuring a live bingo ball draw 
megabingo is televised two to three times per week to multiple bingo halls throughout the us the game enables players to simultaneously view the live bingo ball draw on television monitors located in the bingo hall and compete with players in other halls in the same live bingo game to win a large jackpot prize 
in may  we introduced our legacy platform and its related family of game engines with the launch of megamania  the first high speed  interactive bingo game played on eps linked with one another via nationwide  online telecommunications network 
when first introduced  a game of megamania was approximately two to three minutes in duration 
we used rotating shifts of teams of employees  working twenty four hours per day  to manually draw bingo ball numbers from a bingo ball blower 
these numbers were keyed into the network to appear simultaneously on player station monitors linked to the network and logged onto that game 
today  a game of megamania is approximately one minute in duration  and we use an electronic random number generator to key bingo numbers into the network 
this method has added to the speed and reliability of the game  improved security and significantly reduced overhead 
in january  we introduced our new generation platform and its related family of game engines with the launch of megananza  which has significantly increased our revenues 
several games of megananza can be played in the same amount of time as one game on our legacy platform 
we believe the faster pace permitted by our new generation platform enhances the entertainment and gaming experience of our end users  resulting in an overall increase in the number of end users playing our games and in a higher spending rate per end user 
in june  we introduced reel time bingo  a standard sequence bingo game played on our new generation platform 
over time  we intend to replace megananza with reel time bingo and successor eps in response to competitive and regulatory pressures  and to take advantage of improved technologies 
our current offering of high speed  interactive class ii bingo games consists of n our legacy platform of games  which includes megamania  flash bingo  big cash bingo and people s choice  and n our new generation platform of games  which presently comprises megananza  reel time bingo  and their related family of games 
we currently offer megabingo as part of our class ii product offering  although its contribution to revenues has significantly decreased as customers have migrated to the high speed  interactive market  which produces significantly greater revenue per square foot of gaming hall floor space than megabingo and other forms of paper bingo 
we may discontinue providing megabingo in fiscal year to focus more resources on our other strategic initiatives 
megamania continues to be popular with some end users who  we believe  enjoy paper bingo and therefore prefer the paper bingo like graphics and pace that megamania offers 
we currently offer a variety of class ii eps models within each of our gaming platforms 
each eps has a screen that at all times displays the bingo cards being played and the bingo numbers drawn 
depending upon the end user s entertainment preference  an additional display can be selected that minimizes the size of the bingo card display and shows other graphics that can take many forms  including graphics that simulate spinning reels similar to video slot machines 
some of our eps also use displays adapted from game themes we license from wms and bally 
the screen also serves as a touch pad that allows end users to make game decisions  such as choosing to play or drop bingo cards  and declaring a winning bingo 
the eps house computer terminal equipment that allows end users to communicate with betnet 
eps vary according to height  width and depth to accommodate  in part  the differing space needs of our bingo hall customers  screen size and other features affecting appearance and the visual appeal to end users 
our class ii games are linked via betnet  which provides several important benefits to us  our customers and our end users n a larger numbers of end users can compete in a single game  which increases the size of the prize pool  n class ii gaming requires there to be more than one end user participating in a game  and betnet enables end users to link with each other more quickly  thereby increasing the number of games that can be played at any time  n we are able to introduce technological enhancements via betnet without the need for location by location down time  thereby eliminating lost revenues to our customers  n we are able to monitor network performance in real time which allows us to quickly identify and respond to network problems and avoid significant down time  and n since the frequency of prizes and its related effect upon the popularity of a game depends in part on the total number of end users participating in the same game  we are able to launch new games broadly  thereby enhancing the chance that the new game will become popular with end users 
in addition  our back office system provides information services to our customers  who are able to monitor all aspects of their gaming activities by player station  by game and by bingo hall 
our back office system includes a database server that archives details of distribution and sales  as well as end user information used by the gaming facilities for marketing and player tracking  and a management terminal that can monitor game system operation and generate system reports 
our player tracking system allows us to track the playing preferences of those individual end users who have elected to participate in our player tracking program  thereby gaining potentially valuable design insight into game features that appeal to end users 
it also serves as a marketing tool for our customers  who are made aware  in real time  of end users playing in their facility 
we continuously monitor betnet from a central location in our austin  texas headquarters  which enables us to identify network distribution problems as well as to gather valuable insights into the playing habits of end users that are then utilized in our game design efforts 
class iii games and systems 
we sell or lease linked class iii video lottery systems to native american customers in the state of washington  and receive back office fees based on a share of the hold per day generated by the player stations 
class iii video lottery gaming in the state of washington is allowed pursuant to a compact between the state and certain native american tribes in that state 
the compacts contain the specifications for permissible video lottery systems including n only those video lottery terminals within the same gaming facility may be linked with one another  and n the system must be cashless 
an end user who wishes to play our class iii video lottery terminals in the state of washington must open an account with the cashier in the facility and receive a card encoded with an account number and a personal identification number 
the end user can then use the card to buy an electronic ticket at a video player terminal  add money to the account at a point of sale terminal  or cash out the account 
electronic replicas of scratch tickets are shown on the video lottery terminals  with the results of the wager displayed in a variety of graphical game formats that entertain the end user with motion and sound before revealing the value of the scratch ticket 
we have license agreements with wms and bally that allow us to use several of their popular game themes in the state of washington 
our class iii video player terminals are available in a variety of freestanding and bar top styles having a look and feel that is consistent with traditional video slot machines 
our class iii systems in the state of washington comprise all the software and hardware necessary for operation  and are designed to be readily adaptable to the video lottery requirements of jurisdictions outside that state 
our hardware includes multiple servers that generate sets of electronic lottery tickets and distribute them on demand to end users sitting at terminals networked throughout a casino 
as with our class ii gaming systems  our class iii back office system allows us to maintain details of ticket manufacture  distribution and sales  end user information and the ability to monitor game system operation and generate system reports 
new york video lottery project 
new york recently adopted legislation authorizing the placement of video lottery terminals at new york state racetracks 
the new york lottery conducted a competitive procurement process in which we participated against several competitors 
in may  the new york lottery notified us that we had been selected as the winning vendor to provide the central operating system for its video lottery system 
we believe we were selected over our competition primarily on the basis of the technological superiority of our proposal  as well as price and other factors 
on december   we executed a definitive agreement to provide the central system  which agreement remains subject to various levels of approval by new york state officials before it becomes effective 
gaming contracts virtually all of our class ii and class iii gaming revenues are derived through contracts with our native american customers 
we do not have a written contract with our largest customer 
our contracts typically run from year to year or over multiple years  and can be terminated earlier under certain specified conditions 
the contracts specify the quantity and type of eps to be installed and the terms of the rental or participation arrangement 
there is also a limited waiver of sovereign immunity by each tribe that typically provides for the arbitration of any dispute under the contract  and the right to enforce any decision of the arbitrator by application to a federal or state court having jurisdiction 
under these contracts  we are also granted the right to enter the land of the native american tribe for the purpose of removing our property under certain circumstances 
see risk factors enforcement of remedies or contracts against native american tribes could be difficult 
the terms of our agreements with the various hall operators that conduct megabingo provide for a prize reserve account where a fixed percentage of gross game receipts from megabingo are deposited into an account from which prizes are paid 
end users are not permitted to play for the jackpot prize until sufficient funds are in the prize reserve account to purchase an annuity for the prize or to pay the present value of the prize 
marketing  advertising and promotion we try to arrange national and local news coverage of our games  and provide press releases to local newspapers regarding recent jackpot wins 
we also arrange advertising for the introduction of new games into existing network halls and for new halls added to the network 
in addition  we use a variety of focused advertising and promotion methods  including direct mailings in localities near network halls  discount coupons for new players  advertising in specialized bingo newsletters  the players passport club  and other promotions unique to each hall 
our games typically are prominently featured in participating halls program materials  such as calendars and flyers  and on outdoor billboards near certain participating halls 
while we consult with our customers on advertising and promotion  we pay most of the costs 
we have agreed with substantially all of our customers to set aside approximately of the gross daily revenue of our legacy and of the daily hold of our new generation games  in part to pay these costs and the costs of incrementally new advertising and promotion 
intellectual property we rely to a limited extent upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  license agreements and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights and technology 
since these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection  we rely more upon proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
insofar as we rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how  and innovation  there is no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technology or that secrecy will not be breached 
patents  trademarks and tradenames 
we have three patents issued and ten patents pending in the us our trademarks and tradenames include betnet  players passport  megabingo  megamania  flashcash  big cash bingo  flash bingo  and peoples choice 
all references herein to those trademarks and tradenames are deemed to include the applicable tradename or trademark designation 
see risk factors we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or avoiding claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
licenses we are licensed by the state of washington to conduct class iii gaming in that state  and we are licensed by the states of texas  colorado  and mississippi  and the district of columbia as a manufacturer of charitable gaming equipment 
for class ii gaming  we are licensed by all of the relevant native american gaming commissions that grant licenses pursuant to their gaming ordinances 
we have sought and obtained determinations that our new generation games are class ii gaming from each tribe s gaming commission prior to the installation of the games in their facilities 
competition we currently compete in the native american class ii and class iii gaming markets 
in the class ii market  our existing installed base of linked eps accounts for a significant portion of the installed base of all linked eps in that market 
linked eps in turn account for the great majority of all eps in the class ii market 
with our three largest customers  our linked eps constitute a significant portion of all eps of any kind in their facilities 
we compete in native american class ii gaming markets with companies that are generally smaller than us 
the miami business development authority  a subsidiary of the miami tribe of oklahoma  is our only competitor that offers linked class ii games and eps 
after our own linked games and eps  pull tab dispensers are the next largest category of eps in the class ii gaming market 
in this market  we also compete with vendors of paper bingo and card minders 
in the native american class iii gaming market in the state of washington  we compete primarily against a privately owned company that has the majority of the class iii video lottery market in the state of washington 
employees at september   we had full time and part time employees  including engaged in field operations  in game design  in computer operations relating to bingo activities  in accounting functions  in the design and assembly of eps  in sales and marketing activities  and in other general administrative and executive functions 
we do not have a collective bargaining agreement with any of our employees 
we believe our relationship with our current employees is good 
governmental regulation general 
we are subject to federal  state and native american laws and regulations that affect both our general commercial relationships with our native american customers as well as the products and services we provide them 
the following is only a summary of those laws and regulations and not a complete recitation of all applicable law 
native american gaming 
the operation of gaming on native american lands is subject to igra  which created the nigc to promulgate regulations to enforce certain aspects of igra 
igra classifies games that may be played on native american land into three categories 
class i gaming includes traditional native american social and ceremonial games and is regulated only by the tribes 
class ii gaming includes bingo and  if played at the same location where bingo is played  pull tabs  lotto  punch boards  tip jars  instant bingo  certain card games played under limited circumstances  and other games similar to bingo 
class iii gaming consists of all forms of gaming that are not class i or class ii  such as video casino games  slot machines  most table games and keno 
igra provides that native american tribes may engage in class ii gaming  if n the state in which the native american reservation is located permits such gaming for any purpose by any person  n the gaming is not otherwise specifically prohibited on the native american reservation by federal law  n the gaming is conducted in accordance with a native american ordinance which has been approved by the nigc  and n several other requirements are met  including the requirement that the native american tribe have the sole proprietary interest and responsibility for the conduct of gaming  and that primary management officials and key employees be licensed by the tribe 
under igra  the nigc has the power to inspect and examine all native american gaming facilities  to conduct background checks on all persons associated with class ii gaming  to inspect  copy and audit all records of native american gaming facilities  and to hold hearings  issue subpoenas  take depositions and adopt regulations in furtherance of its responsibilities 
igra authorizes the nigc to impose civil penalties for violations of its regulations or of igra  and also imposes federal criminal sanctions for illegal gaming on native american reservations and for theft from native american gaming facilities 
igra also regulates the terms of gaming management contracts with native americans  which must be approved by the nigc before taking effect 
the nigc has determined that the agreements pursuant to which we provide our class ii games  equipment and services are service agreements and not management contracts  thereby allowing us to obtain terms that might otherwise not be permitted 
under existing regulations  management contracts can have a maximum term of seven years  and limit the amount payable to the manager to of the net revenue from the related gaming activity 
however  the nigc  on occasion  has required that both a shorter term and a reduced percentage of the net revenue be accepted by a manager as a condition of its approval of a management contract 
there is no assurance that further review of our agreements by the nigc or alternative interpretations of applicable laws and regulations will not require substantial modifications to our agreements in a manner that could materially and adversely affect our business 
see risk factors changes in regulation or regulatory interpretations could require us to modify the terms of our contracts with customers 
johnson act 
class ii gaming is defined by igra as including the game of chance commonly known as bingo whether or not electronic  computer or other technological aids are used in connection therewith 
however  the definition of class ii gaming expressly excludes electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind 
prior to june   regulations adopted by the nigc defined electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind as being equivalent to gambling devices as defined and prohibited by the johnson act 
the johnson act defines an illegal gambling device as any machine or mechanical device designed primarily for gambling and that  when operated  delivers money to a player as the result of the application of an element of chance 
courts that have considered the scope of the johnson act in relation to igra have generally determined that the johnson act does not prohibit the use of electronic and technological aids to bingo that operate to broaden the participation of players to play against one another rather than against a machine 
in the four federal courts that have specifically addressed the question of the eps used by us in the play of our games  all four courts have held that our eps are legal technological aids to the game of bingo  and therefore outside the scope of the johnson act 
on june   the nigc adopted new regulations defining the terms electronic  computer or other technological aids that can legally be used in class ii gaming  and of electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of a game of chance that may not be legally used in class ii gaming 
the nigc essentially did away with using the johnson act definition of gambling device as the method of identifying electronic or electromechanical facsimiles  and relied instead upon existing court cases which have identified legal technological aids as those that broaden the participation levels of players in the same game  facilitate communication between and among gaming facilities and allow players to play a game with or against other players rather than with or against a machine 
these new nigc regulations are not binding upon the doj  the agency charged with enforcing the johnson act 
the doj has asserted in the past and continues to assert that n any electronic or mechanical device used in gaming  such as the eps used to play our class ii games  are illegal gambling devices  and in violation of the johnson act  and n the spinning reel design used as a graphic in many of our class ii games is a facsimile of a slot machine  and therefore cannot be used in a class ii game 
see risk factors we face legal and regulatory uncertainties that threaten our ability to conduct our business  increase our cost of doing business and divert substantial management time away from our operations 
class iii video lottery games in the state of washington are permitted and provided pursuant to a compact between the state of washington and certain native american tribes in that state 
native american regulation of gaming 
igra requires that native american tribes adopt and submit for nigc approval gaming ordinances that regulate the conduct of gaming by the tribe 
while these ordinances vary from tribe to tribe  they commonly provide for the following n native american ownership of the gaming operation  n use of gaming net revenues for native american government  economic development or related purposes  n independent audits  including specific audits of all contracts for amounts greater than  n native american background investigations and licenses  n adequate safeguards for the environment and the public health and safety  and n dispute resolution procedures 
megamania litigation 
in late  we became subject to litigation initiated against us by the doj that challenged the legality of our megamania game and the eps used by us in the play of that game 
this litigation was resolved in our favor in decisions by two federal district courts and two federal courts of appeal 
we believe the decisions clarified several important legal issues  such as what constitutes the game of bingo and whether our eps are legal technological aids to the play of bingo  these decisions were in part used by the nigc in adopting its june  regulations 
prior to the megamania litigation  we had received and relied upon opinions and determinations by the nigc that megamania was legal class ii gaming 
notwithstanding these favorable nigc determinations  the doj initiated its own action against us that shut our business down for a short period of time and was very costly and time consuming to litigate 
we face continued uncertainty as to whether we can obtain or rely upon nigc opinions and determinations on the legality of our activities 
regardless of whether we obtain opinions and determinations from the nigc or native american agencies  we face the continued threat of actions initiated by the doj 
see risk factors we face legal and regulatory uncertainties that threaten our ability to conduct our business  increase our cost of doing business and divert substantial management time away from our operations 
megananza litigation 
we are also subject to a pending legal challenge to our megananza bingo game 
see item litigation 
other 
existing federal and state regulations may also impose civil and criminal sanctions for various activities prohibited in connection with gaming operations  including false statements on applications and failure or refusal to obtain necessary licenses described in the regulations 
item properties we do not own any real property 
as of september   we lease the following properties square feet monthly rent expiration date austin  texas corporate offices july assembly facilities july tulsa  oklahoma operations and sales offices february warehouse august  dallas  texas computer programming offices february kent  washington warehouse july the aggregate annual rentals under these leases are approximately  we believe that these leases will be renewed as they expire or that alternative properties can be leased on acceptable terms 
during july  management initiated a plan to relocate the corporate offices in austin  texas as a result of our continued growth and planned expansion 
not included in the above schedule is our existing corporate office lease  which continues through july  with a monthly rent of  item litigation megananza litigation 
on april   we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma against the nigc seeking a judicial declaration that two versions of our megananza family of games are class ii games 
both versions operate in what is called nonstandard sequence  meaning that the ball draw occurs before bingo cards are sold to players 
on june   the nigc  represented by and acting through the doj  filed a motion to dismiss the case  claiming the court lacked jurisdiction on various procedural grounds 
after the nigc commissioner issued an nov to our largest customer on june   the case was expanded to include the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the nigc from taking any enforcement actions against any of our customers for playing megananza 
on september   the court granted the motion of the doj to dismiss our case for lack of jurisdiction 
as a consequence of the dismissal  the temporary restraining order was dissolved and the nigc was no longer prohibited from issuing additional novs or from taking further enforcement actions 
however  by september  the term of the nigc chairman who had issued the nov to our largest customer had expired  and no commissioner had taken his place 
so  under the terms of igra  the nigc  in the absence of a chairman  had no one with the authority to issue a nov 
no new novs have been issued through the date of filing of this annual report 
we have filed an appeal with the tenth circuit seeking a reversal of the district court s ruling to dismiss our action against the nigc 
no action has been taken on our appeal to date  and we are not able to predict what the outcome of the appeal will be 
our major customer that received the nov is currently appealing the issuance of the nov before the nigc under an appeal process established by rules and regulations under igra 
we cannot predict what the outcome of this appeal process will be or what further action  if any  may be taken by the customer or the nigc once the appeal process is completed 
if megananza is ultimately determined to be a class iii game  our customers would likely discontinue the play of megananza and seek alternative games and systems from us or our competitors 
oneida litigation 
on june   the oneida indian nation filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the western district of washington alleging infringement by us of two patents owned by the oneida nation 
discovery is at a very early stage and we are not able to predict what the outcome of the litigation will be 
other litigation 
in addition to the threat of litigation relating to the class ii or class iii status of our games and equipment  we are the subject of various pending and threatened claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
we believe that any liability resulting from these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

we design and develop networks  software and content that provide our customers with a comprehensive gaming system 
historically  we have focused our efforts on class ii gaming systems and class iii video lottery systems used primarily by native american tribes 
we derive our class ii gaming revenues primarily from participation arrangements with our customers 
under these arrangements  we retain ownership of eps installed at our customers bingo halls and receive revenue based on a percentage of the hold per day generated by each eps 
the hold per day is reported by us as gaming revenue and represents the total amount wagered by end users on our eps less the total amount of prizes paid to end users 
payments made to the halls for their share of the hold per day are recorded in our results of operations as allotments to hall operators  and are deducted from our total revenues to arrive at our net revenues 
as competition for class ii gaming revenues increases  our competitors may offer to allocate a greater share of the hold per day to the hall operators 
if this happens  we may need to reduce our share of the hold per day to effectively compete  which would result in lower revenues from our eps 
a comparatively small and declining share of our class ii gaming revenue is from the sale of class ii eps under lease purchase arrangements 
under these arrangements  we receive a series of lease payments based on a percentage of a customer s revenue generated from the leased eps 
at the end of the lease period  we transfer ownership of the eps to the customer 
due to the pace at which we introduce new technology into our games and systems  we believe our class ii customers generally prefer to rent our eps under participation arrangements rather than to incur the capital cost of purchasing an eps that may rapidly be lost to obsolescence 
our reporting of revenues from our television bingo game show  megabingo  which accounts for the balance of our class ii gaming revenues  differs from this model 
we record revenues from megabingo prior to the payment of prizes to end users and prior to an allotment to the hall operator of its share of megabingo revenues 
our recent revenue growth has been driven primarily by our technological innovations and the increase in the installed base of our eps 
our gaming platforms enable us to regularly launch new games that we believe provide end users with greater levels of entertainment 
we believe that this leads to a greater number of end users and to increased end user spending rates 
our new generation gaming platform operates at considerably faster speeds than our legacy platform  generally resulting in end users playing a greater number of games on our new generation platform than they otherwise could have on our legacy gaming platform in the same amount of time 
as a result of the faster speed of play and higher payout ratios  we believe that end users derive a higher level of satisfaction from playing our new generation platform games 
we believe that this enhanced satisfaction results in end users playing games for longer periods of time than they would have played on our legacy platform  resulting in a higher hold per day on our new generation platform eps 
since our inception  we have produced megabingo  a live paper bingo game featuring a live bingo ball draw that we televise to multiple bingo halls throughout the us megabingo enables players in participating halls to compete with players in other halls in a single live bingo game to win a large jackpot prize 
for the year ended september   megabingo revenues were million  and represent a declining percentage of our total revenues 
we may discontinue the megabingo business altogether during fiscal year in may  we introduced our class ii megamania game  the first in a series of high speed  interactive bingo games based on our legacy platform and played on eps linked with one another via a nationwide  online telecommunications network 
in january  we introduced our class ii megananza game  based on our new generation platform  which plays faster than our legacy games and has generated increased revenues for us and our customers 
in june   we introduced reel time bingo  a new generation based high speed standard sequence bingo game  in which the cards are purchased before the balls are drawn 
over time  we intend to replace megananza with reel time bingo and successor player stations in response to competitive and regulatory pressures  and to take advantage of improved technologies 
the majority of our class iii video lottery systems are sold for an up front purchase price 
in addition  we also receive back office fees based on a share of the hold per day 
back office fees cover our service and maintenance of the back office server installed in each hall to run our class iii games and the related player tracking systems 
for those video lottery systems sold to our customers  the back office fees are considerably smaller than the revenue share we receive from class ii eps being rented under participation agreements  and generally only cover our operating costs 
accordingly  we derive our revenues from class iii gaming to a greater extent from the sale of player stations as compared to the class ii market 
we also enter into either participation or lease purchase arrangements for our class iii video lottery systems that are similar to those for our class ii systems 
in june  we first installed class iii video lottery terminals in the state of washington  which was the first state where class iii video lottery systems were permitted by native american state compact 
our sales of class iii video lottery terminals peaked in  as initial sales were made pursuant to newly adopted native american state compacts with the state of washington which limited the number of installed class iii video lottery terminals permitted on native american land 
during  we had an average of  class iii video lottery terminals in service  compared to  units in we have license agreements with wms and bally to use certain trademarks  logos and graphics in connection with our class iii games 
we  in turn  resell these licenses to our customers in connection with the installation of our class iii video lottery terminals using these licenses 
revenues from these license fees are included in other revenues in our results of operations 
we also have a similar license agreement for the class ii market with bally  wms  and mikohn 
we do not resell class ii licenses  as we generally install our class ii games and eps with our customers on a participation arrangement basis 
in addition to bingo prizes and related costs and allotments to hall operators  our next largest expense directly related to our class ii and class iii gaming revenue is amortization and depreciation 
we own approximately of our class ii eps and we generally depreciate the cost of these eps over three years 
with certain class iii customers  we sell eps under lease purchase agreements  and depreciate these eps over the term of the lease  which is generally one to three years 
we also capitalize certain costs related to the design and development of our gaming products and systems 
we generally amortize internally developed games over an eighteen month period  and gaming platforms over a three year period 
during the year ended september   we capitalized  of internal software costs 
our cost of eps sold is the smallest component of our expenses as a percentage of our total revenues  and is commensurate with the contribution made by eps sales to our total revenues 
recent developments 
during the last half of fiscal  we faced several legal  regulatory and market challenges to megananza  our most popular class ii game  which accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the most recent fiscal year 
on april   we received an advisory opinion from the deputy general counsel of the nigc  stating that megananza and its related family of games were class iii games as defined by igra 
by april   we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma against the nigc  seeking a judicial declaration that two versions of our megananza family of games are class ii games 
both versions operate in the same way as megananza  in what is called nonstandard sequence  meaning that the ball draw occurs before bingo cards are sold to players 
on june   the nigc and the doj filed a motion to dismiss the case  claiming the court lacked jurisdiction on various procedural grounds 
after the nigc commissioner issued an nov to our largest customer on june  for playing megananza  the case was expanded to include the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the nigc from taking any enforcement actions against any of our customers for playing megananza 
as a result of the issuance of the nov  our largest megananza customer and certain other customers discontinued playing megananza and requested that we install reel time bingo  a class ii bingo game operated on our new generation platform and played in standard sequence  meaning that the ball draw occurs after the bingo cards are sold 
on september   the court granted the doj s motion to dismiss our case for lack of jurisdiction 
as a consequence of the dismissal  the temporary restraining order was dissolved and the nigc was no longer prohibited from issuing additional novs or from taking further enforcement actions 
however  by september  the term of the nigc chairman who had issued the nov to our largest customer had expired  and no commissioner had taken his place 
so  under the terms of igra  the nigc  in the absence of a chairman  had no one with the authority to issue a nov 
no new novs have been issued through the date of filing of this annual report 
we have filed an appeal with the tenth circuit seeking a reversal of the district court s ruling to dismiss our action against the nigc 
no action has been taken on our appeal to date and we are not able to predict what the outcome of the appeal will be 
our major customer that received the nov is currently appealing the issuance of the nov before the nigc under an appeal process established by rules and regulations under igra 
we cannot predict what the outcome of this appeal process will be or what further action  if any  may be taken by the customer or the nigc once the appeal process is completed 
if megananza is ultimately determined to be a class iii game  our customers would likely discontinue the play of megananza and seek alternative games and systems from us or our competitors
