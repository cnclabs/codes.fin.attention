critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes contingent percentage lease revenue when each hotel achieves annual specified room revenue hurdles  effectively deferring the recognition of contingent percentage lease revenue from the first and second quarters to the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
there are no significant estimates involved in the recognition of revenue 
due to the timely remittance of payments  no significant allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded 
joint ventures the company has a interest in three joint ventures 
the company has determined that it does not have a controlling interest in any of the joint ventures and therefore uses the equity method to recognize its share of net income or loss from the joint ventures and adjusts the carrying value of the investment accordingly 
the joint ventures assets  liabilities  and equity are not recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the company receives current financial information from the joint ventures and performs an analysis to determine its share of income 
this analysis includes the review of operational data  significant assets and liabilities  and results of operations to ensure that the company s interests are realizable 
the company considers the operating trends and expectations for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that these joint venture operations presently support the carrying value of the investments in joint ventures 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the hotel properties 
the company performs an analysis of the operating results of the assets and trends and prospects of the local hotel and lodging market 
key company and industry statistics include occupancy rates  average daily room rates  and revenue per available room revpar 
significant changes in the hotel and lodging market could affect the analysis 
during the second half of  the industry and the company experienced a decline in revpar 
the company expects the negative trend in revpar to continue through the second quarter of the company will continue to analyze the operating results of each hotel and evaluate the potential for impairment 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
derivatives are used primarily to fix the interest rate on debt based on floating rate indices and to manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
further  the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
on december   the company completed an interest rate swap on  of its outstanding variable rate debt under its  line of credit the line 
the company s interest rate swap qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes  and therefore is reported at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the company s amounts due to banks could affect the hedge determination 
the interest rate swap effectively replaces the company s variable interest rate based on day libor on  of the line with a fixed interest rate of until december   which is two years prior to the expiration of the line  at which time the variable rate debt will no longer be fixed 
the company plans to continue to monitor its interest rate risk and to manage and limit this risk in accordance with its established interest rate risk management policies

seasonality the company s operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher revpar during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality and the structure of the percentage leases  which provide for a higher percentage of room revenues above the minimum equal quarterly levels to be paid as percentage rent  can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s receipt of quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
sab  which requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until the lessee has achieved annual specified hurdles  effectively defers recognition by the company of a significant portion of percentage lease revenue from the first and second quarters to the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year

the terrorist attacks of september  and the effects of the economic recession have led to a substantial reduction in business and leisure travel throughout the united states  and industry revpar generally  and revpar at our hotels specifically  has declined substantially since september while revpar at our hotels has improved from the depressed levels in the weeks immediately following the events of september  revpar at our hotels remains below pre september levels and may remain at such depressed levels 
we cannot predict the extent to which the events of september and the economic recession will continue to directly or indirectly impact the hotel industry or our operating results in the future 
continued depressed revpar at our hotels which we expect in the near term could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our debt instruments  our ability to fund capital improvements and renovations at our hotels and our ability to make dividend payments necessary to maintain our reit tax status 
additional terrorist attacks could have further material adverse effects on the hotel industry and our operations 
we may not have access to financing for acquiring or developing additional hotels 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy depends  in part  on our ability to finance additional hotel acquisitions and development 
we are subject to restrictions that may limit our ability to take advantage of expansion opportunities that we believe are attractive 
our existing million line of credit limits our borrowing availability to a percentage of the value of the hotels provided as collateral  with the value determined in part by the cash flow generated by those hotels 
as a result  as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our line of credit  of which million was outstanding 
if we need to borrow funds under the line of credit in excess of our current borrowing availability  we must provide additional collateral  which may not be available  to increase our borrowing availability to the total amount of debt we need  up to a maximum amount million 
in addition  our articles of incorporation limit our debt to of the cost of our investment in hotel properties 
our ability to raise additional equity capital will depend on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds through a public or private offering at a time when we need access to funds 
we may seek alternative methods of funding expansion  such as joint venture development  however  we cannot assure you that such opportunities will be available when we need them or on acceptable terms 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders depends upon the ability of our lessees to make rent payments under our leases  particularly the ability of one lessee that accounts for most of our revenue 
our income depends upon rental payments from lessees of our hotels 
any failure or delay by the lessees in making rent payments would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our lessees ability to make rental payments depends on their ability to generate sufficient revenues from our hotels in excess of operating expenses 
our leases require the lessees to pay us the greater of a base rent or percentage rent and other additional charges 
as a result  we participate in the economic operations of our hotels through our share of room revenues which exceed threshold amounts specific to each hotel 
the lessees ability to pay on time or at all could be negatively affected by reductions in revenue from the hotels or in the net operating income of the lessees or otherwise 
our lessees also will be affected by factors beyond their control  such as changes in the level of demand for rooms and related services of our hotels  their ability to maintain and increase gross revenues at our hotels and other factors 
forty eight of our hotels are leased to capstar winston company  llc  a subsidiary of meristar hotels and resorts  inc for  approximately of our percentage lease revenue was generated by lease payments from capstar winston 
therefore  any operating difficulties or other factors specifically affecting capstar winston s ability to maintain and increase gross revenues at our hotels and to pay rent to us could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our returns depend on management of our hotels by third parties 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot operate any hotel or participate in the decisions affecting the daily operations of any hotel 
either our lessees  or an operator under a management agreement with a lessee  controls the daily operations of our hotels 
under the reit modernization act of the rma  which became effective january   reits are permitted to lease their hotels to wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries of the reits trs lessees 
even under the rma  trs lessees may not operate the leased hotels and must enter into management agreements with eligible independent contractors that will manage the hotels 
we do not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel eg  setting room rates 
thus  even if we believe our hotels are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in anticipated rent payments under existing leases  we cannot require a change to the method of operation 
in particular  if the hotels leased by capstar winston were operated in an inefficient or ineffective manner  we would not be able to require changes in the operation of those hotels  and the rent from those hotels constitutes most of our revenue 
we can only seek redress if a lessee violates terms of its lease  and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the lease 
in addition  our growth strategy contemplates additional hotel acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and selective development of hotels as market conditions warrant 
our ability to grow depends  in part  upon the ability of our lessees and any third party managers to manage our current and future hotels effectively 
if the lessees or the third party managers are not able to operate additional hotels at current staffing levels and office locations  they may need to hire additional personnel  engage additional third party managers and or operate in new geographic locations 
if the lessees or the managers fail to operate the hotels effectively  our ability to generate revenues from the hotel leases could be diminished 
we have a significant level of debt that may limit our ability to take certain actions 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit and winston spe  llc  a special purpose financing subsidiary of winn limited partnership a partnership of which we are the sole general partner  had million outstanding under a fixed rate loan 
as of december   the total liabilities of our three joint ventures were million million of which represented long term debt 
our proportionate share of such total liabilities and long term debt equated to million and million 
our level of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes in the future  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing our funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic  industry and business conditions 
if we or our financing subsidiary do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt at maturity  it may be necessary for us to refinance our debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities or additional equity offerings 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancings  increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and  consequently  cash available for distribution to shareholders 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we or our financing subsidiary may be forced to dispose of hotels or other assets on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses and adverse effects on cash flow from operating activities 
if we are unable to make required payments of principal and interest on debt secured by our hotels  one or more of those properties could be foreclosed upon by the lender with a consequent loss of revenue and asset value 
the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 
the terms of our line of credit impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests  including leverage ratios  maximum unsecured and secured debt ratios  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  paying dividends in excess of of our funds from operations over the most recent four quarters  making capital expenditures and other investments  creating liens on our assets  and engaging in mergers  consolidations or the sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our line of credit 
furthermore  our line of credit provides that any default under  or acceleration of  any of our other debt  any debt of winn limited partnership or any debt of our subsidiaries  including any default by our financing subsidiary under its fixed rate loan or otherwise  will constitute a default under the line of credit 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under our line of credit 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it  in which case we would not be able to make distributions to our shareholders 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our cash flow decreases  we may be required to provide additional collateral under our line of credit or take other actions that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have pledged hotel properties as collateral to secure the line of credit and our financing subsidiary has pledged hotel properties to secure the fixed rate loan 
both loan agreements prohibit pledging any hotel pledged as collateral under that facility to secure other debt 
our line of credit limits our borrowing availability to a percentage of value of the hotels provided as collateral  with the value determined in part by the cash flow generated by those hotels 
our current cash flow from the hotels securing the line of credit limits our borrowing availability under the line of credit  which as of december   was million 
if we need to borrow funds under the line of credit in excess of our borrowing availability  we must provide additional collateral to increase our borrowing availability to the total amount of debt we need  but not to exceed million 
if our cash flow decreases to such a level that our borrowing availability is less than the amount outstanding under the line of credit  we must either repay the excess of the amounts outstanding over our borrowing availability or with the unanimous consent of the lenders  provide additional collateral to increase our borrowing availability 
if we were unable to repay the excess debt over our borrowing availability or provide additional collateral  the resulting payment default would entitle our lenders to exercise one or more remedies  including foreclosing on one or more of the properties pledged as collateral 
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow 
our borrowings under our line of credit bear interest at a variable rate 
our line of credit requires that we maintain at least of our total debt at a fixed rate of interest 
although we have entered into agreements that limit our interest rate exposure on a portion of the outstanding debt under our line of credit  outstanding debt of up to million under our line of credit remains subject to variable interest rates 
we may incur debt in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher interest rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow 
we may not be able to complete development of new hotels on time or within budget 
we intend to develop additional hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise 
new project development is subject to a number of risks that could cause increased costs or delays in our ability to generate revenue from any development hotel  reducing our cash available for distribution to shareholders 
these risks include construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  competition for suitable development sites  receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  and substantial development costs in connection with projects that are not completed 
we may not be able to complete the development of any projects we begin and  if completed  our development and construction activities may not be completed in a timely manner or within budget 
we also intend to rehabilitate hotels that we believe are underperforming 
these rehabilitation projects will be subject to the same risks as development projects 
hotels that we develop have no operating history and may not achieve levels of occupancy that result in levels of percentage rent that provide us with an attractive return on our investment 
the new hotels that we develop have no operating history 
we will negotiate the percentage rent formula for these hotels based on projections of occupancy and average daily room rates for the area in which each hotel is or will be located and the type of hotel under development 
however  these hotels may not achieve anticipated levels of occupancy or average daily room rates 
similarly  during the start up period  room revenues may be less than required to result in the payment of rent at levels that provide us with an attractive return on our investment 
property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit our control of those investments 
joint ventures or partnerships other than winn limited partnership involve risks not otherwise present for investments we make on our own 
it is possible that our co venturers or partners may have different interests or goals than we do at any time and that they may take actions contrary to our requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investment include impasses on decisions  because no single co venturer or partner has full control over the joint venture or partnership 
each of our venture partners for our three existing joint venture properties has the right  after the first twelve months of the hotel s operation  to sell the hotel developed by the joint venture to us  or  if we elect not to purchase  to sell such hotel to a third party 
in addition  future joint ventures may include other restrictions on us  including requirements that we provide the joint venture with the right of first offer or right of first refusal to acquire any new property we consider acquiring directly 
our business could be disrupted if we need to find a new lessee upon termination of an existing lease 
if our lessees fail to materially comply with the terms of a hotel lease including failure to pay rent when due  we have the right to terminate the lease  repossess the applicable hotel and enforce payment obligations under the lease 
if capstar winston defaults under any lease  the default will constitute a default under all of our leases with capstar winston and its affiliates 
thus  we will have the right to terminate all of those leases 
upon termination  we would have to find another lessee or establish or identify a trs lessee to lease the property 
in either case  we cannot operate the hotels directly due to federal income tax restrictions 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another lessee or operator or that  if another lessee or operator were found  we would be able to enter into new leases or management contracts favorable to us 
there would be disruption during any change of hotel management that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  it is possible that we would not be able to enforce the payment obligations under the leases following termination 
if we decide to sell hotels  we may not be able to sell those hotels on favorable terms and may be required to pay termination fees to the lessees of those hotels 
we have contracts to sell our durham  north carolina hampton inn hotel and our clearwater  florida comfort inn hotel 
if the sale of our hampton inn hotel in durham  north carolina closes  we will recognize a gain on the sale of approximately  subject to final negotiations of a lease termination payment with the lessee 
if the sale of our comfort inn hotel in clearwater  florida closes  we will recognize a loss on the sale of approximately  each of the purchasers under these two contracts is in a due diligence period during which that purchaser may terminate its contract without penalty 
if either purchaser elects not to terminate its contract  we would anticipate closing the sale of that hotel within days 
although none of our other hotels is currently under contract to sell  we may decide to sell hotels in the future 
we may not be able to sell such hotels on favorable terms  and such hotels may be sold at a loss 
furthermore  under our leases  upon the sale of a hotel  we must either pay a termination fee to our lessee or offer to lease another suitable property to the lessee 
the amount of the termination fee would depend on the revenue from the hotel and the remaining term of the lease 
alternatively  we may negotiate with our lessee to waive the lease provision and arrange for the lessee to continue to lease the property from the buyer 
if we were not able to successfully negotiate such a continuation of the lease  we would be required to pay a termination fee  lease another suitable property or abandon the sale transaction 
we may face conflicts of interest relating to sales of hotels acquired from affiliates 
we have acquired hotels in the past from related parties of our affiliates  which include robert winston  our chief executive officer  and charles winston  our chairman of the board 
the limited partners of winn limited partnership  including robert winston and charles winston  may have unrealized gain associated with their interests in these hotels 
our sale of any of those hotels may cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners 
therefore  our interests could conflict with the interests of the limited partners in connection with the disposition of one or more of those hotels  including the limited partners who may be in a position to exert influence over other board members who will determine whether we sell these hotels 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our president  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller and executive vice president of development to drive our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
the loss of any of their services could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our borrowers may fail to repay all or a portion of the mezzanine loans owed to us 
we face special risks in connection with our mezzanine loans to borrowers for the purpose of building and owning hotels 
we are subject to risks of borrower defaults  bankruptcies  fraud and losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance 
we expect that each mezzanine loan will be made to a single purpose entity whose sole asset would be a hotel being built or renovated 
our present mezzanine loans are not  and we do not expect that any of our future mezzanine loans will be  collateralized by the hotel being built by the single purpose entity 
mezzanine loans will be subordinate to any debt collateralized by the hotel being built or any other debt of the single purpose entity 
mezzanine loans involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage lending that is secured by income producing real property for a variety of reasons including  among other things  dependency on the success of a project which a third party controls and that a foreclosure by the holder of the senior loan could result in a mezzanine loan becoming uncollectible 
additionally  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional term loans 
the borrowers may not be able to repay their obligations under their senior loans or our mezzanine loans  in which case we could suffer a total or partial loss on our mezzanine loans 
the borrower under a mezzanine loan in which we have a  participation interest is currently in default of its payment obligations under the loan and other existing or future borrowers may become in default on our mezzanine loans 
if third parties for whom we develop hotels default on their loans  we may be required to complete the development of those hotels at our own expense 
in certain cases where we are offering third party hotel development services in exchange for fees  we may elect to provide the hotel owner developer with a construction completion guaranty on the particular hotel under development 
in those cases  if the owner developer were in default under the terms and conditions of its senior loans  its senior lenders might seek to compel us to complete the development of the particular hotel with our own funds  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our industry our performance and the value of our stock are subject to risks associated with the hotel industry 
our hotels are subject to operating risks of the hotel industry that could reduce our revenue and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
our hotels are subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of our lessees to generate revenues and to make payments to us and therefore affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
these risks include competition for guests from other hotels  faster growth in room supply than in room demand growth in our markets  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  seasonality  with higher hotel revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorist incidents  which may also deter traveling  and adverse effects of general and local economic conditions 
we may incur higher costs as a result of the proximity of our hotels to the coast 
several of our hotels are located near the atlantic ocean and are exposed to more severe weather than hotels located inland 
these hotels are also exposed to salt water and humidity  which can increase or accelerate wear on the hotels weatherproofing and mechanical  electrical and other systems 
as a result  we may incur additional expenditures for capital improvements 
conditions of franchise agreements could adversely affect us 
all of our hotels are operated pursuant to franchise agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands 
in addition  hotels in which we subsequently invest may be operated pursuant to franchise agreements 
a hotel s failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement could result in the loss or cancellation of its franchise license 
the franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for  and restrictions and limitations on  the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor s system 
these standards are subject to change over time  in some cases at the discretion of the franchisor  and may restrict our ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor 
in addition  compliance with these standards could require us to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
our cash available for distribution could be adversely affected if we or our lessees must incur substantial costs to maintain a franchise license 
in connection with termination of a franchise license or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel  we may have to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
moreover  the loss of a franchise license could have a material adverse effect on the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise because of the loss of association  name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation system provided by the franchisor 
any of these events could have a negative effect on our distributions to shareholders 
the franchise agreements covering the hotels expire or terminate  without special renewal rights  at various times and have different remaining terms 
operating costs and capital expenditures could adversely affect our cash flow 
hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  particularly in older structures  including periodic replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
under the terms of our leases  we are obligated to pay the cost of certain capital expenditures at the hotels and to pay for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
franchisors also may require periodic capital improvements to our hotels as a condition of retaining the franchise licenses 
in addition  we intend to invest selectively in hotels that require significant renovation 
renovation of hotels involves certain risks  including the possibility of environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovation  and the emergence of unanticipated competition from other hotels 
if any of these costs exceed our estimates  the additional costs could have an adverse effect on our cash available for distribution 
we must compete with larger entities for acquisition opportunities 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
these entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a hotel operator or the geographic proximity of its investments 
competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the bargaining power of sellers 
in addition  other potential buyers who do not need to use a lessee or a third party operator to operate the hotel may be able to offer a higher price for a property than we are able to pay 
our performance and value are subject to the condition of the real estate industry 
we may not be able to sell hotels when appropriate 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic and other conditions 
because we are a reit  federal income tax laws limit our ability to sell properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so 
as a result  returns to our shareholders could be adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the market value of any of our hotels will not decrease in the future  and therefore we may not be able to sell our hotels on favorable terms 
liability for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  originating at or in the property  including fixtures  structures and other improvements located on the property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or should have known of  or caused  the presence of contaminants 
clean up costs and the owner s or operator s liability generally are not limited under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or the aggregate assets of the owner or operator 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to properly remediate  contaminants may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the clean up costs of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
environmental  health and safety laws and common law principles also govern the presence  effects  maintenance and removal of hazardous substances  including asbestos containing materials  or acms 
asbestos has been found in two of our hotels and asbestos or other hazardous substances may be found in other hotels we own or acquire in the future 
many such laws permit third parties  including employees and independent contractors  to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances  including acms 
in connection with the ownership of the hotels  we may be considered an owner or operator and therefore may be potentially liable for any such costs  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
liability for uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment 
certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes  floods  hurricanes  and other acts of god  may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
in addition  we may not be able to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property as a result of changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations or other factors 
in these circumstances  any insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the damaged or destroyed property and we would be required to seek separate financing for repair and replacement costs  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  or face a loss on our investment 
the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other changes in governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
in addition  other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of the hotels could change  including changes to building codes and fire and life safety codes 
if we are required to spend money to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our ability to make distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected 
increases in property taxes could adversely affect our cash flow 
real and personal property taxes on our current and future hotel properties may increase as property tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities 
an increase in property taxes could have an adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
risks relating to our capital stock the price of our securities may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
one of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock or preferred stock in public trading markets is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock or preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
thus  an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
shareholder approval is required to change certain policies  limiting the ability of our board of directors to take certain actions in response to changing conditions 
we cannot change our policy of limiting consolidated debt to of the cost of our investment in hotel properties without approval of the holders of a majority of our shares of common stock entitled to vote 
in addition  the approval of the holders of two thirds of our shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to change our policy of seeking to maintain qualification as a reit 
as a result  our board of directors could not change either of these policies without first receiving shareholder approval at an annual or special meeting  even if the change in policy would be advantageous to us 
the ability of our shareholders to effect a change in control is limited 
stock ownership limitations could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation provide that no shareholder may own  directly or indirectly  more than of any class of our outstanding stock 
this limitation may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control by a third party without the approval of our board of directors even if a change in control were in your best interest 
our ability to issue preferred stock could inhibit changes in control 
our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares of preferred stock issued 
currently  there are  shares of preferred stock outstanding 
issuing additional preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control were in our shareholders interest 
risks relating to reit status 
we are subject to tax risks as a result of our reit status 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our continuing ability to meet various requirements concerning the ownership of our outstanding stock  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income  and the amount of distributions to our shareholders 
in order to qualify as a reit  we generally are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income  other than any net capital gain 
to the extent that we meet the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be required to pay income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount we pay out to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the federal tax laws 
the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on future acquisitions  unanticipated capital expenditures or repayment of debt  which would require us to borrow funds or to sell assets to fund the costs of such items 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  distributions to our shareholders to comply with the current distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
our income consists of our share of the income of winn limited partnership  and our cash available for distribution consists of our share of cash distributions from the partnership  less capital expenditures and principal debt payments 
differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the receipt of cash available for distribution due to the seasonality of the hotel industry could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the current distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year  we would not be allowed to deduct our distributions to our shareholders in computing our taxable income 
furthermore  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
unless we are entitled to relief under the federal income tax laws  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification 
as a result  our cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved 
although we currently operate and intend to continue to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause our board of directors  with the consent of shareholders holding at least two thirds of the common stock entitled to vote  to revoke the reit election 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in thousands as of december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates related solely to debt outstanding under the line 
debt outstanding under the line totaled  at december  the line  which expires in january  bears interest generally at rates from day libor plus to day libor plus  based on the company s consolidated debt leverage ratio 
the company s current interest rate is day libor plus 
during  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to eliminate the exposure to increases in day libor over  and therefore from its exposure to interest rate increases over under the line on a principal balance of  for the period of march  through march  in addition  on december   the company completed an interest rate swap on  of its outstanding variable rate debt under the line 
the agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate interest payments for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
this transaction effectively replaces the company s variable interest rate based on day libor on  of the line with a fixed interest rate of until december  the line s interest rate spread is currently  equating to an effective fixed rate of on  until december  the differential paid or received on interest rate agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the weighted average interest rate on the line for was 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had  of variable rate debt outstanding under the line that was exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest 
the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk under the line is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest at december  the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities of the company s ge capital corporation fixed rate debt principal and interest rates by maturity dates at december  maturity date fixed rate debt interest rate thereafter
