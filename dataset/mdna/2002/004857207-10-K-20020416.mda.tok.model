item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements below 
overview we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of non powered lawn and garden tools 
we are a holding company with no business operations of our own 
our only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of uniontools  inc founded in  we completed an initial public offering in we used a portion of the proceeds of such offering to repay debt associated with a leveraged buyout 
since  we have implemented a business strategy designed to transform us from a manufacturing oriented industrial company into a marketing oriented consumer products and service company 
the central elements of our approach include a market segmentation strategy based primarily on brand management and a merchandising strategy based on attractive and informative product displays and labeling 
we have structured the organization toward and have maintained sufficient inventory levels such that we deliver on time and in full to our customers on over of our shipments 
in fiscal  we focused on strategically rationalizing our business model to restore profitability 
this included discontinuing the manufacture and sale of watering products and an emphasis on profitable products and relationships with customers 
since fiscal  improvements in our forecasting and planning processes  we believe  have allowed us to consistently provide the highest service levels in the industry 
we experienced manufacturing inefficiencies during the first half of fiscal  primarily due to the effects of consolidating manufacturing facilities in the second half of calendar those issues have now been addressed and resolved  with the focus in fiscal on cost savings opportunities 
we have also decreased the cost of our logistical processes  reducing the number of distribution locations from three to one in columbus  ohio 
these reductions were accomplished during fiscal with minimal effect on service level performance 
the net result is that we believe that we have been able to correct the problems that arose in calendar and contributed to the operating losses during that time period 
the discontinuation of watering products and cost management on sales support and other overhead expenses allowed us to lower our selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal this was partially offset late in the year by our decision to outsource all information system functions and support to acxiom corporation 
the transition was completed in fiscal  with no disruption to our business and resulting in a strengthened technology platform and resources available to us 
in fiscal  we were able to see the results of our cost savings efforts across all areas of the business 
margins were up and overhead costs were down versus the prior year 
we were able to make favorable changes in the employee benefit programs  including the termination of certain retiree medical and life benefits 
during fiscal  we were able to leverage our strong relationship with employees to negotiate one year extensions of our current agreements at our injection molding and distribution center operations  in addition to a three year contract with the union representing the workers at our primary manufacturing facility in frankfort  new york 
while we made significant progress in fiscal in terms of improved operating profitability primarily through cost reductions  this was dampened due to the effect of the ongoing retail consolidation within our industry 
we had several top customers file for bankruptcy or liquidation during fiscal  with the resulting loss of business and bad debt negatively affecting our financial performance 
during fiscal  we were able to extend our credit facility through april the extension was expensive in terms of both fees and the requirement that we explore strategic alternatives for the sale or disposition of the company or its assets 
during the second half of fiscal  we evaluated many strategic alternatives  including the possibility of an outright sale of the company 
however  at the end of the process  we chose to pursue the alternative that clearly provided the highest return to stockholders 
in february  we announced our intention to pursue a recapitalization transaction with our majority stockholders 
in essence  the recapitalization provides that the majority stockholders would invest up to million in cash and convert million of debt into an equity interest in the company 
additionally  upon completion of the recapitalization  the holders of our common stock  other than the principal holders and their affiliates  would receive rights at the rate of rights per shares of our common stock held as of a record date to be established to purchase one share of our common stock at per share for each right received 
in addition to the reduction of our debt obligations to our majority stockholders  we believe this transaction will also provide us with the ability to execute a new credit facility on terms more favorable to us in the timeframe required under our existing credit agreement 
as of april   we have been unable to obtain a financing commitment to support the recapitalization transaction or to execute a definitive purchase agreement 
as a result  we are currently in default of our existing credit facility 
while we are working diligently to complete the recapitalization and the subsequent new credit facility  though possibly in a form different than that outlined in our february announcement  and thereby cure the default  we believe our existing bank group will continue to fund our operations 
however  there can be no assurance as to when and if an agreement will be reached 
if we are unable to reach an agreement  it will impact our principal sources of liquidity and our ability to meet future cash requirements 
this shortfall could force us to consider alternatives that may include negotiating further amendments to our existing credit facility  attempting to obtain loans from third party sources  asset sales  a sale of the company  or other remedies appropriate to the circumstances 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain components of our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal calendar year ended months unaudited net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense amortization of intangibles asset impairment other expenses  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss five month period ended unaudited net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense amortization of intangibles asset impairment other expenses  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes benefit loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in net sales was driven by a drop in the sale of long handled tools  caused by soft demand during the spring season and the credit condition of a few key customers  limiting our ability to ship their full demand in fiscal we believe the soft demand has been industry wide and resulted from customer actions to manage to lower retail inventories  as well as  a longer winter weather pattern across the country that negatively effected spring season purchases 
the discontinuation of the sale and manufacture of watering products and the ongoing rationalization of customers and products within our custom injection molding product line also contributed to the decline in net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to cost improvements partially offset by lower sales volume and the related loss of overhead absorption from lower production levels 
included in the cost improvements are the net favorable effect of changes in certain employee benefit plans  including the termination of certain retiree medical and life benefits  which resulted in a one time gain of million less related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal versus million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to cost reductions in sales support costs and administrative overhead in response to lower sales volume  including the effect of the discontinuation of watering products 
operating profit 
operating profit gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  to a profit of million for fiscal compared to a profit of million in fiscal the increase in operating profit was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for fiscal compared to million in the comparable period of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and debt levels partially offset by costs incurred to extend our credit facility 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in amortization is due to the lower amount of goodwill to be amortized  as a result of asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal asset impairment charge 
an asset impairment charge of million was recognized in fiscal based on management review of the recoverability of goodwill given the completion of our evaluation of strategic alternatives and our agreement to enter into a transaction which valued the common stock of the company at per share 
there was an asset impairment charge of million in fiscal based on our review of the net realizable value on certain long lived assets primarily goodwill related to the manufacture and sale of watering products 
other expenses  net 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the improvement is primarily due to the absence of costs associated with the sale of certain assets related to the manufacturing and sale of watering products 
in fiscal  we spent million  primarily in financial consulting and legal fees  to pursue and evaluate strategic alternatives leading up to the recapitalization transaction 
loss before income taxes 
loss before income taxes deteriorated to a loss of million for fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the deterioration was due primarily to the goodwill writedown discussed above 
net loss 
net loss was million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal net loss per share was basic and diluted for fiscal based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net loss per share of basic and diluted for fiscal  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
fiscal compared to calendar net sales 
net sales decreased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the decline in net sales was caused primarily by lower watering product sales 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold assets related to the manufacturing and sale of watering products 
the sales of long handled tools were slightly lower than a year ago due to the rationalization of unprofitable customers and products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar gross margin increased to for fiscal compared to for calendar the increase in gross profit and margin were driven by several factors improved customer service levels  shipment fulfillment processes  and consolidation of distribution centers 
in addition  we continued to focus on cost reductions and improvements in logistical and manufacturing process controls to drive year to year gains in fiscal an emphasis on profitable products and relationships with customers has also favorably influenced margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal versus million in calendar as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to in calendar the improvement reflects the elimination of sales and administrative support for the sale of watering products  as well as  productivity gains and cost reductions  including lower sales expenses and a reduction in personnel 
operating income loss 
operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses improved million  to a profit of million for fiscal compared to a loss of million in calendar the improvement in operating income was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher market rates libor and borrowing costs  as a result of the most current amendment to our loan agreement  and higher borrowing levels during the year 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the reduction in amortization is due to the lower amount of goodwill to be amortized  resulting from the asset impairment charges recognized during these time periods 
asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recognized in fiscal and a similar charge of million was recorded in calendar we recognized these charges based on our review of the net realizable value on certain long lived assets related to the manufacture and sale of watering products 
other expenses  net 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the improvement is primarily due to the absence of costs associated with the manufacturing consolidation program that we executed in calendar and lower management restructuring costs 
in fiscal  the improvements were partially offset by a loss incurred on the sale of certain assets related to the manufacturing and sale of watering products 
for purposes of comparison  all costs associated with management restructuring have been classified in other expenses 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million to a loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in calendar the decreased loss was primarily due to the items discussed above 
net loss 
net loss decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar net loss per share basic and diluted was for fiscal  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net loss per share of basic and diluted for calendar  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
transition compared to the comparable period in net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in transition compared to million in the comparable period of the increase in net sales was caused by higher gross sales of long handled tools  partially offset by lower gross sales of molded products and an increase in allowances and deductions 
strong customer demand  including gains from reduction of order backlog  drove the increase in sales of long handled tools 
the decrease in gross sales of molded products was primarily due to the loss of one significant customer 
the increase in allowances and deductions was primarily a result of continued difficulties in manufacturing and logistical control 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million in transition compared to million in the comparable period of gross margin decreased to in transition from in the comparable period of the declines in gross profit and margin were driven primarily by several factors 
logistical and manufacturing control issues identified in fiscal continued to negatively affect customer service levels and related costs and higher distribution and freight expenses 
unfavorable absorption variances were incurred due to lower production levels resulting from difficulties related to the manufacturing consolidation and due to the timing of expense recognition resulting from changing our fiscal year to a calendar year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for transition compared to million in the comparable period of as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in transition from in the comparable period of the increase was due to investments in marketing related activities and information system infrastructure and associate related expenses  including workers compensation and group benefit costs 
operating income loss 
operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  to a loss of million for transition from breakeven for the comparable period of the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or million  to million for transition compared to million in the comparable period of the increase in interest expense was due to higher debt levels and interest rates  consistent with the change in terms resulting from the amendment of our credit agreement  effective october  amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill remained flat at million in transition and in the comparable period of asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recognized in transition based on our review of the net realizable value on certain long lived assets 
there was no asset impairment charge in the comparable period of other expenses  net 
other net expenses including special charges increased to million in transition from million in the comparable period of the increase was due primarily to costs associated with our manufacturing consolidation program and management restructuring costs offset by the absence of acquisition related costs incurred in the comparable period of the cost of our manufacturing consolidation was higher than anticipated due to inefficiencies in initial production  including training  scrap  and machine repair costs 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes increased million to a loss of million in transition compared to a loss of million in the comparable period of the increased loss was primarily due to the items discussed above 
net loss 
net loss was million in transition compared to a loss of million in the comparable period of net loss per share basic and diluted was in transition  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net loss per share of basic and diluted in the comparable period of  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  impact of weather the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during those months 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
weather is the single most important factor in determining market demand for our products and also is the least predictable 
for example  springtime flooding unfavorably affects the sale of most types of lawn and garden equipment  while moderate to heavy snowfall during winters usually results in a surge in demand for snow shovels 
bad weather during the spring gardening season can adversely affect overall annual sales  but if the weather is favorable during construction projects  such as new housing starts and government spending on highways  this usually represents an increase in demand for long handled tools 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited data for each of the quarters in fiscal and fiscal the financial data for each of these quarters is unaudited but includes all adjustments which we believe to be necessary for a fair presentation 
all quarters include normal recurring adjustments 
these operating results  however  are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal quarter ended unaudited in thousands net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     selling  general and administrative expenses sg a     gross profit less sg a     net sales as a percentage of full year net sales gross profit as a percentage of full year gross profit fiscal quarter ended unaudited in thousands net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     selling  general and administrative expenses sg a     gross profit less sg a   net sales as a percentage of full year net sales gross profit as a percentage of full year gross profit does not include amortization of intangibles and other expenses  each of which generally are non seasonal in nature 
liquidity and capital resources we are substantially dependent upon borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary cash needs are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
we have financed our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   approximately million was available under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
indebtedness outstanding bears interest at either the bank prime rate plus a margin of or  at our option  the libor rate plus a margin of 
net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by operations of million in fiscal the net loss increased by million in fiscal  but the non cash addbacks  including the asset impairment charge and the loss on sale of assets  improved million versus the prior year 
inventory levels remained relatively flat in fiscal in fiscal  the liquidation of excess and obsolete inventory plus the sale of watering product inventory created a million source of cash 
continued improvement in inventory levels in fiscal were offset late in the year by an increase needed to support new business commitments for the first quarter of fiscal other liabilities was a stronger use of cash in fiscal  primarily due to the reduction in the post retirement medical accrual resulting from the termination of certain benefits 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in transition and million during fiscal the capital expenditures relate primarily to ongoing improvements of property  plant and equipment  manufacturing process improvements  increased manufacturing capacity and system technology infrastructure upgrades or enhancements 
capital requirements were lower in fiscal and fiscal due to the activity levels and expenditures made during transition and fiscal the focus on the core business the last two years combined with a stronger emphasis on sourcing products or components has also lessened capital requirements 
on july   the company entered into a sixteenth amendment to its amended and restated credit facility the sixteenth amendment  the terms of which it believes will be sufficient to fund operations through april   the revised term of the facility 
the sixteenth amendment provides for a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility from january through july million from july through october  million from november through december 
available borrowings under the revolving facility are based on specified percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the sixteenth amendment provides for scheduled loan payments to be applied on a pro rata basis to the outstanding balances under our acquisition loans and revolving facility 
the scheduled loan payments are as follows date payment july   september   december   march   april  entire remaining principal balance of the acquisition loans  together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon  and all other obligations  shall be due and payable in full 
the sixteenth amendment contains certain covenants  which  among other things  require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain tests  including maintaining cumulative ebitda above specified levels  and places limits on future capital expenditures 
the sixteenth amendment also maintains the negative covenants that existed under the previous credit facility 
in addition  in compliance with the requirements of the sixteenth amendment  we engaged investment bankers to identify strategic alternatives  including the sale of the company 
borrowings under the sixteenth amendment bear interest at either the bank prime rate plus a margin of or  at our option  the libor rate plus a margin of 
interest is due and payable monthly in arrears 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee of per year on the unused portion of the revolving facility 
the sixteenth amendment also includes a success fee of approximately  the success fee can be reduced to a minimum of  based upon satisfaction of certain provisions within the sixteenth amendment 
on october   we entered into a seventeenth amendment to the amended and restated credit facility the seventeenth amendment  the terms of which extended certain of the covenants covered in the sixteenth amendment through the term of the credit facility 
in december  the credit facility was also amended to allow us to keep the manufacturing facility and assets that produce and sell custom injection molding products 
we believe these assets are more valuable supporting our core business than if sold separately 
we have evaluated the various strategic alternatives presented to us and have concluded that the optimal choice was to agree to and exercise the letter of intent put forth on february   to recapitalize the debt and equity of the company 
under this arrangement  the majority stockholders  tcw funds and ocm principal opportunities funds  have agreed to invest up to million in cash and convert approximately million in subordinated debt into equity at a value of per share 
additionally  upon completion of the recapitalization  the holders of our common stock  other than the principal holders and their affiliates  would receive rights at the rate of rights per shares of our common stock held as of a record date to be established to purchase one share of our common stock at per share for each right received 
this represents the highest value for the equity of any of the strategic alternatives considered 
the proposed recapitalization is contingent upon  among other things  obtaining new financing for the company s operations 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility 
however  subsequent to that date we fell in default of the credit facility because we have been unable to obtain a financing commitment to support the letter of intent transaction or to execute a definitive purchase agreement 
while we are working diligently to complete the transaction  though possibly in a form different than that outlined in the original letter of intent  and thereby cure the default  we believe our existing bank group will continue to fund our operations 
given the critical nature and timeframe of these issues  we believe significant progress and clarification can be made prior to the expiration of our credit facility on april  however  there can be no assurance as to when and if an agreement will be reached 
if we are unable to reach an agreement  it will adversely impact our principal sources of liquidity and our ability to meet future cash requirements 
this shortfall could force us to consider alternatives that may include negotiating further amendments to our existing credit facility  attempting to obtain loans from third party sources  asset sales  a sale of the entire company  or other remedies appropriate to the circumstances 
if we are successful in consummating the letter of intent and obtaining new financing  then we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to operate over the term of the new facility 
in addition  we believe that our improved profitability in tandem with lower interest costs as a result of a less leveraged capital structure will also provide us sufficient liquidity to move through our operating cycle 
this would include all lease and debt principal payments  as well as  any rollover or incremental letter of credit requirements as further described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
however  if future financial results do not meet our expectations or the recapitalization transaction is not completed  we will activate contingency plans  further reducing expenditures  and take other actions to operate within the resources and alternatives available 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  customer programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  pensions and post employment benefits 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with regard to criterion  we recognize revenue when our customer takes title to the goods 
if the customer relationship is such that we arrange and pay for the shipping and delivery fob destination  the revenue is not recognized until the customer takes title and physical possession of the goods at their location 
if the responsibility for shipping and delivery rests with the customer  revenue is recognized when the goods and title are transferred to their carrier 
customer programs 
to promote our business within a competitive industry  we selectively offer programs to customers such as cooperative advertising or volume rebates 
we accrue for these programs monthly  based on the amount earned at that point in time  typically as it relates to year to date sales volume 
in addition  customers will take deductions unexpectedly for operational errors such as shortages  pricing  and defectives 
we recognize these costs immediately in the month that the customer takes a deduction from payment 
in addition  we set up a reserve against accounts receivable for deductions that we can reasonably estimate will occur when the outstanding receivables are paid  ie  an incurred but not reported reserve based on current run rate of operational deductions 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentives  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue or increase in costs at the time the incentive is offered 
in addition  if actual customer deductions exceed the amounts projected by us  additional reserves would be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due ranging from for amounts one to thirty days past due to for amounts more than days past due based on our historical experience 
if circumstances change ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimations of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
every month we update our sales forecast and production plan on a rolling twelve month basis 
we evaluate our inventory against that forecast 
items that are inactive or active with on hand quantities exceeding twelve months usage in the sales forecast or production plan are reviewed for value deterioration and an appropriate obsolescence reserve is recognized 
this review is of particular importance due to the inventory builds required during an operating cycle to deal with the seasonality of the business 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
effects of inflation we are adversely affected by inflation primarily through the purchase of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and higher interest rates 
we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have not been material in recent years 
forward looking statements statements in the foregoing discussion that indicate our intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations  or predictions of the future are forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to  among other risks and uncertainties inherent in our business  the following important factors weather is the most significant factor in determining market demand for our products and is inherently unpredictable 
inclement weather during the spring gardening season and lack of snow during the winter may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during those months 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with either excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
our ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of gross sales in fiscal a substantial reduction or cessation of sales to these or other major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
certain retail distribution channels in the lawn and garden industry  such as mass merchants and home centers  are experiencing consolidation 
there can be no assurance that such consolidation will not have an adverse impact on certain customers or result in a substantial reduction or cessation of purchases of our products by certain customers 
in addition  we are facing increasing pressure from retailers with respect to pricing  cooperative advertising  and other rebates as the market power of large retailers continues to grow 
there can be no assurance that such pressures will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
a key element of our growth strategy is to increase sales in certain distribution channels that we believe are growing more rapidly than the overall industry  such as home centers and mass merchants through retailers such as sears and home depot 
there can be no assurance that retailers in such distribution channels will continue to open a significant number of new stores or  if opened  that we will be chosen to supply our products to all or a significant portion of such stores 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such stores will generate significant additional sales for us or that such stores will not result in a reduction of sales to our other customers  whether through consolidation or otherwise 
our future growth and development is largely dependent upon the services of a 
corydon meyer  our president and chief executive officer  as well as our other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
meyer s services  or the services of one or more of our other executive officers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our products require the supply of raw materials consisting primarily of steel  plastics  and ash wood 
although we have several suppliers for most of our raw materials  there can be no assurance that we will not experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply 
in addition  there can be no assurance that prices for such materials will remain stable 
any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
all aspects of the lawn and garden industry  including attracting and retaining customers and pricing  are highly competitive 
we compete for customers with large consumer product manufacturers and numerous other companies that produce specialty home and garden products  as well as with foreign manufacturers that export their products to the united states 
many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than us 
there can be no assurance that increased competition in the lawn and garden industry  whether from existing competitors  new domestic manufacturers  or additional foreign manufacturers entering the united states market  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
most of our hourly associates are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements 
we currently are a party to four such agreements one of which expires in  two expire in  and one expires in there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating new labor contracts on terms satisfactory to us or without work stoppages or strikes 
a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations governing  among other things  emissions to air  discharge to waters  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with these environmental requirements and regularly review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws 
we also have been involved in remediation actions with respect to certain facilities 
amounts expended by us in such compliance and remediation activities have not been material to us 
current conditions and future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  may  however  give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
furthermore  as is the case with manufacturers in general  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of our properties  we may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material 
new housing starts often represent an addition to the overall number of consumers in the lawn and garden tool market and  accordingly  an increase in demand 
similarly  government spending on highways  bridges  and other construction projects often represents an increase in demand for long handled tools 
a decline in housing starts or government spending on construction projects could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
adverse changes in general economic conditions in the united states  including the level and availability of consumer debt  the level of interest rates  and consumer sentiment regarding the economy in general  could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our inability to successfully extend our credit facility ongoing  or to extend the credit facility on terms and conditions favorable to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our inability to complete the recapitalization could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the factors set forth above are not exhaustive 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we will not undertake  and specifically decline  any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or un anticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors  nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements
