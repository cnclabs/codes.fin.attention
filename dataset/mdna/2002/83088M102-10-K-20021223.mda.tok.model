item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on december   alpha  conexant and washington sub  inc washington  a wholly owned subsidiary of conexant  entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of conexant s wireless business with alpha 
under the terms of the agreement  conexant would spin off its wireless business into washington  including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in newbury park  california  but excluding certain assets and liabilities  to be followed immediately by the merger of this wireless business into alpha with alpha as the surviving entity in the merger 
the merger was completed on june  following the merger  alpha changed its corporate name to skyworks solutions  inc immediately following completion of the merger  the company purchased the mexicali operations for million 
for financial accounting purposes  the sale of the mexicali operations by conexant to skyworks was treated as if conexant had contributed the mexicali operations to washington as part of the spin off  and the million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to conexant 
accordingly  our consolidated financial results include the assets  liabilities  operating results and cash flows of the washington business and the mexicali operations for all periods presented  and also include the results of operations of alpha from june   the date of acquisition 
the washington business and the mexicali operations are collectively referred to as washington mexicali 
references to the company refer to washington mexicali for all periods prior to june  and to the combined company following the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby washington was treated as the acquirer and alpha as the acquiree  primarily because conexant shareholders owned a majority  approximately percent  of the company upon completion of the merger 
under a reverse acquisition  the purchase price of alpha was based upon the fair market value of alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the merger and the fair value of alpha stock options 
the purchase price of alpha was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by washington  as the acquiring company for accounting purposes  based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date 
because the merger was accounted for as a purchase of alpha  the historical financial statements of washington mexicali became the historical financial statements of the company after the merger 
because the historical financial statements of the company after the merger do not include the historical financial results of alpha for periods prior to june   the financial statements may not be indicative of future results of operations or the historical results that would have resulted if the merger had occurred at the beginning of a historical financial period 
skyworks fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september fiscal years  and each comprised weeks and ended on september  september and september  respectively 
for convenience  the consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month 
accordingly  references to september   and contained in this discussion refer to the actual fiscal year end of the company 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries skyworks is a leading wireless semiconductor company focused on providing front end modules  radio frequency subsystems and complete system solutions to wireless handset and infrastructure customers worldwide 
we offer a comprehensive family of components and rf subsystems  and also provide complete antenna to microphone semiconductor solutions that support advanced g and g services 
we have entered into various agreements with conexant providing for the supply of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to conexant  initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by conexant from washington mexicali 
we have also entered into agreements with conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by conexant and silicon based wafer fabrication services by jazz semiconductor  inc  a newport beach  california foundry joint venture between conexant and the carlyle group to which conexant contributed its newport beach wafer fabrication facility 
historically  washington mexicali obtained a portion of its silicon based semiconductors from the newport beach wafer fabrication facility 
pursuant to our supply agreement with conexant  we are initially obligated to obtain certain minimum volume levels from jazz semiconductor based on a contractual agreement between conexant and jazz semiconductor 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
our operating results have been  and our operating results may continue to be  negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as changes in demand for end user equipment  the timing of the receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  availability and cost of products from suppliers  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  intellectual property disputes  the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions 
in the past  average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  warranties  restructuring costs and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title  in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete 
certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or a right of return on unsold products 
a reserve for sales returns and allowances for non distributor customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and has not been significant for any of the periods presented 
inventories we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those excess inventories 
we sell our products to communications equipment oems that have designed our products into equipment such as cellular handsets 
these design wins are gained through a lengthy sales cycle  which includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
moreover  once a customer has designed a particular supplier s components into a cellular handset  substituting another supplier s components requires substantial design changes which involve significant cost  time  effort and risk 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
consequently  when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the net realizable value of such inventories is generally estimated to be zero 
the amount of the write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  are continually monitored and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
deferred income taxes we have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial united states deferred tax assets 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance may be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
the portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the merger is approximately million 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
in fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 
a valuation allowance has not been established because the company believes that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carry forward period 
warranties reserves for estimated product warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to rework or replace defective products 
should actual product failure rates or costs differ from estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce our gross margins 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
results of operations general in fiscal  our revenues from product sales to third parties increased approximately from fiscal  as a result of renewed demand for our wireless product portfolio 
the increased demand is partially due to reduction in the level of excess channel inventories that had adversely affected the digital cellular handset markets during fiscal revenues attributable to alpha  post merger  included in fiscal were approximately million 
during the company consolidated facilities  reduced its work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives 
in addition  increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to an improvement in operating results in fiscal cost of goods sold for fiscal was adversely affected by a charge of million in connection with expected losses for certain wafer fabrication commitments made under a supply agreement with conexant whereby we are initially obligated to obtain certain minimum volume levels from jazz semiconductor  inc cost of goods sold for fiscal also reflects approximately million of additional costs related to the merger 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries during fiscal  we like many of our customers and competitors were adversely impacted by a broad slowdown affecting the wireless communications sector  including most of the end markets for our products 
our net revenues for fiscal reflected deterioration in the digital cellular handset market resulting from excess channel inventories due to a slowdown in demand for mobile phones and a slower transition to next generation phones 
the effect of weakened end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of component inventories among manufacturer  subcontractor and distributor customers 
the overall slowdown in the wireless communications markets also affected our gross margins and operating income 
cost of goods sold for fiscal was adversely affected by the significant underutilization of manufacturing capacity 
cost of goods sold for fiscal also reflects million of inventory write downs across our product portfolio resulting from the sharply reduced end customer demand for digital cellular handsets 
expense reduction and restructuring initiatives during fiscal  the company reduced its workforce through involuntary severance programs and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities 
the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation  facility sales  and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 
in fiscal  we implemented a number of expense reduction and restructuring initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the then current business environment 
the cost reduction initiatives included workforce reductions  temporary shutdowns of manufacturing facilities and significant reductions in capital spending 
through involuntary severance programs and attrition  we reduced our workforce in fiscal by approximately employees principally in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  we periodically idled our newbury park  california wafer fabrication facility and  for a portion of fiscal  implemented a reduced workweek at our mexicali facility 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in fiscal related to the workforce reductions completed through september  the restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction actions resulted in a quarterly reduction of operating expenses of approximately million for the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared with the second quarter of fiscal asset impairments during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility in mexicali  mexico 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in the market for test and assembly services for non wireless products and the related impact on our current and projected outlook 
the company experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at its mexicali facility for non wireless products and projected decreasing revenues and new order volume 
management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the mexicali facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase out of services sold to conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the business  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows 
we believe the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our may acquisition of philsar semiconductor inc philsar 
philsar was a developer skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries of radio frequency semiconductor solutions for personal wireless connectivity  including emerging standards such as bluetooth  and radio frequency components for third generation g digital cellular handsets 
management determined that the company would not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business 
accordingly  this product line has been discontinued and the employees associated with the product line have either been severed or relocated to other operations 
as a result of the actions taken  management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition had been impaired 
goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the merger will be tested for impairment following the guidelines established in sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we will adopt sfas in the beginning of our fiscal year  and are required to perform a transitional impairment test for goodwill upon adoption 
we may be required to record a substantial transitional impairment charge as a result of adopting sfas the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  subject to the transitional impairment test  is approximately million at september  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million charge for the impairment of the manufacturing facility and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at the company s newbury park  california facility 
this impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for wireless communications products and the related impact on the then current and projected business outlook of the company 
through the third quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at the newbury park wafer fabrication facility and decreasing revenues  backlog  and new order volume 
management believed these factors  together with its decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures for advanced process technologies and capacity beyond the then current levels  indicated that the value of the newbury park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the newbury park facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the industry  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management s decision to focus on existing products based on the current technology 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected cash flows 
the company believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets

we recognize revenues from product sales directly to our customers and to distributors upon shipment and transfer of title 
provision for sales returns is made at the time of sale based on experience 
an insignificant portion of product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or a right of return on unsold products 
revenues from product sales to customers other than conexant  which represented  and of total net revenues for the fiscal years  and  respectively  increased in principally reflecting increased sales of gsm products  including power amplifier modules and complete cellular systems 
we also experienced increased demand for our power amplifier modules for cdma and tdma applications from a number of our key customers 
revenues attributable to alpha  post merger  included in fiscal were approximately million 
revenues from product sales to customers other than conexant decreased when comparing fiscal to fiscal principally resulting from the significant decrease in demand throughout the industry during this period 
revenues from wafer fabrication and semiconductor assembly and test services provided to conexant represented  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in when compared to the prior years is primarily attributable to lower demand for assembly and test services from conexant s mindspeed technologies and broadband access businesses due to the broad slowdown affecting most of the communications electronics end markets for conexant s products 
gross margin years ended september  in thousands gross margin third parties    of net revenues from third parties conexant    of net revenues from conexant gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  royalty and other intellectual property skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries costs  warranties and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
cost of goods sold also includes allocations from conexant through june  of manufacturing cost variances  process engineering and other manufacturing costs which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as incurred 
the improvement in gross margin from third party sales for fiscal  compared with fiscal  reflects increased revenues  improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the write down of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets in the third quarter of fiscal and the mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of the effect of the write down of the newbury park wafer fabrication assets and the mexicali facility assets on fiscal gross margin was approximately million and million  respectively 
although recent revenue growth has increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities  these facilities continue to operate below optimal capacity and underutilization continues to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross margin 
gross margin for fiscal was also adversely impacted by additional warranty costs of million 
the additional warranty costs were the result of an agreement with a major customer for the reimbursement of costs the customer incurred in connection with the failure of a product when used in a certain adverse environment 
although we developed and sold the product to the customer pursuant to mutually agreed upon specifications  the product experienced unusual failures when used in an environment in which the product had not been previously tested 
the product has since been modified and no additional costs are expected to be incurred in connection with this issue 
in addition  under a wafer fabrication supply agreement with conexant  we are initially obligated to obtain certain minimum volume levels from jazz semiconductor  inc based on a contractual agreement between conexant and jazz semiconductor 
we originally estimated our obligation under this agreement would result in excess costs of approximately million when recorded as a liability and charged to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated this obligation and reduced our liability and cost of sales by approximately million in the quarter 
gross margin for the year ended september  benefited by approximately million as a result of the sale of inventories having a historical cost of million that were written down to a zero cost basis during fiscal year  such sales resulted from sharply increased demand beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal that was not anticipated at the time of the write downs 
gross margin for fiscal was adversely affected by inventory write downs of approximately million  partially offset by approximately million of subsequent sales of inventories written down to a zero cost basis 
the inventory write downs recorded in fiscal resulted from the sharply reduced end customer demand we experienced  primarily associated with our radio frequency components  as a result of the rapidly changing demand environment for digital cellular handsets during that period 
as a result of these market conditions  we experienced a significant number of order cancellations and a decline in the volume of new orders  beginning in the fiscal first quarter and becoming more pronounced in the second quarter 
during fiscal  we sold an additional million of inventories previously written down to a zero cost basis 
as of september   we continued to hold inventories with an original cost of approximately million which were previously written down to a zero cost basis 
we currently intend to hold these remaining inventories and will sell these inventories if we experience renewed demand for these products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  if we are able to sell a portion of the inventories that are carried at zero cost basis  our gross margins will be favorably affected 
to the extent that we do not experience renewed demand for the remaining inventories  they will be scrapped as they become obsolete 
approximately million and million of inventories that were carried at zero cost basis were scrapped during fiscal and  respectively 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries under supply agreements entered into with conexant in connection with the merger  we will receive wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor s newport beach  california foundry  and we will provide wafer fabrication  wafer probe  final test and other services to conexant at our newbury park facility  in each case  for a three year period after the merger 
we will also provide semiconductor assembly and test services to conexant at our mexicali facility 
during the term of one of our supply agreements with conexant  our unit cost of goods supplied by jazz semiconductor inc s newport beach foundry will continue to be affected by the level of utilization of the newport beach foundry joint venture s wafer fabrication facility and other factors outside our control 
pursuant to the terms of this supply agreement with conexant  we are committed to obtain a minimum level of service from jazz semiconductor  inc  a newport beach  california foundry joint venture between conexant and the carlyle group to which conexant contributed its newport beach wafer fabrication facility 
we estimate that our obligation under this agreement will result in excess costs of approximately million and we have recorded this liability in the current period 
in addition  our costs will be affected by the extent of our use of outside foundries and the pricing we are able to obtain 
during periods of high industry demand for wafer fabrication capacity  we may have to pay higher prices to secure wafer fabrication capacity 
research and development years ended september  change change in thousands research and development    of net revenues research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 
research and development expenses also include allocated costs for shared research and development services provided by conexant through june   principally in the areas of advanced semiconductor process development  design automation and advanced package development  for the benefit of several of conexant s businesses 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects the opening of a new design center in le mans  france and higher headcount and personnel related costs 
subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal  we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the cdma  gsm  general packet radio services  or gprs  and third generation  or g  wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets 
during fiscal  the company focused its research and development investment principally on wireless communications applications such as next generation power amplifiers  radio frequency subsystems and cellular systems 
in particular  the company has focused a significant amount of research and development resources in developing complete network protocol stacks and user interface software in support of its cellular systems initiative 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal primarily reflects higher headcount and personnel related costs to support the company s expanded development efforts and the accelerated launch of new products 
the higher fiscal research and development expenses also include costs of approximately million resulting from the acquisition of philsar in fiscal under transition services agreements with conexant entered into in connection with the merger  conexant will continue to perform various research and development services for us at actual cost generally until december   unless the parties otherwise agree 
to the extent we use these services subsequent to the expiration of the specified term  the pricing is subject to negotiation 
selling  general and administrative years ended september  change change in thousands selling  general and administrative    of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower headcount and personnel related costs resulting from the expense reduction and restructuring actions initiated during fiscal and lower provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable 
under the transition services agreement  conexant will continue to perform various services for us at actual cost until december   unless the parties otherwise agree 
to the extent we use these services subsequent to the expiration of the specified term  the pricing is subject to negotiation 
amortization of intangible assets years ended september  change change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   nm  of net revenues nm not meaningful in  the company recorded million of intangible assets related to the merger consisting of developed technology  customer relationships and a trademark 
these assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives principally ten years 
we will adopt sfas in the beginning of our fiscal year  and are required to perform a transitional impairment test for goodwill upon adoption 
we may be required to record a substantial transitional impairment charge as a result of adopting sfas the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  subject to the transitional impairment test  is approximately million at september  in connection with the fiscal acquisition of philsar  we recorded an aggregate of million of identified intangible assets and goodwill 
these assets have been amortized over their estimated useful lives principally five years 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the philsar bluetooth business 
management has determined that the company will not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business 
accordingly  this product line has been discontinued and the employees associated with the product line have either been severed or relocated to other operations 
as a result of the actions taken  management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition had been impaired 
the philsar write off resulted in a decrease in amortization expense in fiscal the increase in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the philsar acquisition in and the associated amortization of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets that were related to this transaction 
purchased in process research and development in connection with the merger in the third quarter of fiscal  million was allocated to purchased in process research and development and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition as a charge not deductible for tax purposes because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
prior to the merger  alpha was in the process of developing new technologies in its semiconductor and ceramics segments 
the objective of the in process research and development effort was to develop new semiconductor processes  ceramic materials and related products to satisfy customer requirements in the wireless and broadband markets 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of the alpha in process research and development ipr d at the time of acquisition 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries estimated costs to discount rate in millions date acquired iprd complete projects applied to iprd alpha june  the semiconductor segment was involved in several projects that have been aggregated into the following categories based on the respective technologies power amplifier power amplifiers are designed and manufactured for use in different types of wireless handsets 
the main performance attributes of these amplifiers are efficiency  power output  operating voltage and distortion 
current research and development is focused on expanding the offering to all types of wireless standards  improving performance by process and circuit improvements and offering a higher level of integration 
control products control products consist of switches and switch filters that are used in wireless applications for signal routing 
most applications are in the handset market enabling multi mode  multi band handsets 
current research and development is focused on performance improvement and cost reduction by reducing chip size and increasing functionality 
broadband the products in this grouping consist of radio frequency rf and millimeter wave semiconductors and components designed and manufactured specifically to address the needs of high speed  wireline and wireless network access 
current and long term research and development is focused on performance enhancement of speed and bandwidth as well as cost reduction and integration 
silicon diode these products use silicon processes to fabricate diodes for use in a variety of rf and wireless applications 
current research and development is focused on reducing the size of the device  improving performance and reducing cost 
ceramics the ceramics segment was involved in projects that relate to the design and manufacture of ceramic based components such as resonators and filters for the wireless infrastructure market 
current research and development is focused on performance enhancements through improved formulations and electronic designs 
the material risks associated with the successful completion of the in process technology are associated with the company s ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips  masks and manufacturing processes required 
the company expects to benefit from the in process projects as the individual products that contain the in process technology are put into production and sold to end users 
the release dates for each of the products within the product families are varied 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the products incorporating the in process research and development  if successful 
the projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair value 
the discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflects the stage of completion and other risks inherent in each project 
the weighted average discount rate used in the valuation of in process research and development was percent 
the ipr d projects were expected to commence generating cash flows in fiscal special charges asset impairments during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility in mexicali  mexico 
the impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in the market for test and assembly services for non wireless products and the related impact on the company s current and projected outlook 
the company has experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at its mexicali facility for non wireless products and projected decreasing revenues and new order volume 
management believes these factors indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the mexicali facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase out of services sold to conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the business  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices are consistent with historical trends and management s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows 
the company believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our fiscal acquisition of the philsar bluetooth business 
management has determined that the company will not support the technology associated with the philsar bluetooth business 
accordingly  this product line will be discontinued and the employees associated with the product line have either been severed or relocated to other operations 
as a result of the actions taken  management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the philsar acquisition had been impaired 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an million charge for the impairment of the manufacturing facility and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at the company s newbury park  california facility 
this impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for wireless communications products and the related impact on the then current and projected business outlook of the company 
through the third quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at the newbury park wafer fabrication facility and decreasing revenues  backlog  and new order volume 
management believed these factors  together with its decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures for advanced process technologies and capacity beyond the then current levels  indicated that the value of the newbury park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed 
in performing the analysis for recoverability  management estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the newbury park facility over a ten year period 
the estimated future cash flows were based on modest volume increases consistent with management s view of the outlook for the industry  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
the declines in average selling prices are consistent with historical trends and management s decision to focus on existing products based on the current technology 
since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value approximately million based on historical cost of the related assets  it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized 
the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value 
the fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of  which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected cash flows 
the company believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets 
the write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets 
restructuring charges during fiscal  the company reduced its workforce through involuntary severance programs and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities 
the charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease cancellation  facility sales  and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 
during fiscal  washington mexicali reduced its workforce by approximately employees  including approximately employees in manufacturing operations 
restructuring charges of million were recorded for such actions and were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for the affected employees 
substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one year 
activity and liability balances related to the fiscal and fiscal restructuring actions are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal workforce facility closings actions reductions and other total charged to costs and expenses  cash payments  restructuring balance  september  charged to costs and expenses   cash payments   restructuring balance  september  in addition  the company assumed approximately million of restructuring reserves from alpha in connection with the merger 
on september  this balance was million and substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid within one year 
other income expense  net other income expense  net is comprised primarily of interest expense  interest income on invested cash balances  gains losses on the sale of assets  foreign exchange gains losses and other non operating income and expense items 
the decrease to million of other expense  net in fiscal from million of other income  net in fiscal is principally the result of skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries approximately million of additional interest expense related to the short term note to conexant for the mexicali facility purchase 
provision for income taxes the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits relating to the historical operations of washington mexicali were retained by conexant in the spin off transaction  and will not be available to be utilized in our future separate tax returns 
as a result of our history of operating losses and the expectation of future operating results  we determined that it is more likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future deductions associated with mexicali in the post spin off period 
consequently  no united states income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the us operating losses 
as of september   we have established a valuation allowance against all of our net us deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during the carry forward period 
the provision benefit for income taxes for fiscal  and consists of foreign income taxes incurred by foreign operations 
we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the united states until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in  the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately million related to the impairment of our mexicali assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at september   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
working capital at september  was approximately million compared to million at september  annualized inventory turns were approximately for the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  days sales outstanding included in accounts receivable for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately days 
cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  reflecting a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges depreciation and amortization  asset impairments and an in process research and development charge of million and a net increase in the non cash components of working capital of approximately million 
during the company consolidated facilities  reduced its work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives 
in addition  increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal cash provided by investing activities for fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million and dividends to conexant of million offset by cash received of million as a result of the merger and million from the sale of short term investments acquired in the merger 
the capital expenditures for fiscal reflect a significant reduction from annual capital expenditures in fiscal  a key component of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal cash provided by financing activities for fiscal principally consisted of net transfers from conexant  pre merger  of million and million of proceeds from borrowings against the revolving credit facility with conexant 
on september   the company had million in short term promissory notes payable to conexant pursuant to a financing agreement entered into in connection with the purchase of the mexicali operations 
the notes were secured by the assets and properties of the company 
unless paid earlier at the option of the company or pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions contained in the financing agreement with conexant  fifty percent of the principal portion of the short term promissory notes was due on march   and the remaining fifty percent of the notes was due on june  interest on these notes was payable quarterly at a rate of per annum for the first ninety days following june   per annum for the next ninety days and per annum thereafter 
because the company refinanced these notes  the principal amount was classified on september  as a long term note payable 
in addition  on september  the company had available a short term million loan facility from conexant under the financing agreement to fund the company s working capital and other requirements 
million of this facility became available on or after july   and the remaining million balance of the facility would have become available if the company had more than million of eligible domestic receivables 
the entire principal of any amounts borrowed under the facility was due on june  there were million of borrowings as of september  under this facility 
because the company refinanced the amounts borrowed under this loan facility  the principal amount was classified on september  as a long term note payable 
on november   skyworks successfully closed a private placement of million of percent convertible subordinated notes due these notes can be converted into shares of common stock per  principal balance  which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately per share 
the net proceeds from the note offering were principally used to prepay debt owed to conexant skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries under the financing agreement 
the payments to conexant retired million of the million note relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations and repaid the million principal amount outstanding as of november  under the loan facility  dissolving the million facility and resulting in the release of conexant s security interest in all assets and properties of the company 
in connection with the prepayment by the company of million of the million note owed to conexant relating to the purchase of the mexicali operations  the remaining million principal balance of the note was exchanged for new convertible debt securities with a maturity date of june  these notes can be converted into the company s common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price  which is subject to adjustment based on  among other things  the market price of the company s common stock 
based on this adjustable conversion price  the company expects that the maximum number of shares that could be issued under the note is approximately million shares  subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences 
in addition to the retirement of million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to conexant  skyworks also retained approximately million of net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs 
cash used in operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
operating cash flows for fiscal and reflect net losses of million and million  respectively  offset by non cash charges depreciation and amortization  asset impairments and an in process research and development charge of million and million  respectively  and a net decrease in the non cash components of working capital of approximately million and a net increase of million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures for fiscal reflect a significant reduction from annual capital expenditures in fiscal  a key component of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal cash used in investing activities for fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million partially offset by cash received of million in the acquisition of philsar 
the capital expenditures for fiscal reflect a significant reduction from annual capital expenditures in fiscal  a key component of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal cash provided by financing activities consisted of net transfers from conexant of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
historically  conexant has managed cash on a centralized basis 
cash receipts associated with washington mexicali s business were generally collected by conexant  and conexant generally made disbursements on behalf of washington mexicali 
during fiscal years through  we made a series of capital investments which increased the capacity of our newbury park gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility 
we made these investments to support then current and anticipated future growth in sales of our wireless communications products  such as power amplifiers  that use the gallium arsenide process 
during the same period  we made a series of capital investments at our mexicali facility to expand our integrated circuit assembly capacity  including the addition of assembly lines using surface mount technology processes for the production of multi chip modules  which the mexicali facility principally produces for us 
the capital investments also increased the mexicali facility s test capacity  including radio frequency capable equipment for testing wireless communications products 
we invested in the mexicali facility to support then current and anticipated future growth in sales of our wireless communications products and to support increasing demand for assembly and test services from conexant 
capital investments for the newbury park wafer fabrication facility totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a significant portion of the fiscal capital investments were made to continue or complete capital investment programs that we had initiated during fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to the broad slowdown affecting the wireless communications sector  including us and conexant  we sharply curtailed our capital expenditure programs 
although reduced capital expenditures are a key component of the cost reduction initiatives  a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries following is a summary of consolidated debt and lease obligations at september  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements  in thousands obligation total years years thereafter debt    operating leases     total debt and operating lease obligations     under supply agreements entered into with conexant in connection with the merger  the company s expected minimum purchase obligations will be approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these agreements are related to wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services the company will receive from jazz semiconductor s newport beach  california foundry 
with the exception of million related to fiscal purchase obligations  which has been accrued in fiscal  we currently anticipate meeting each of the annual minimum purchase obligations under the three year supply agreement with conexant 
based on the closing of the private placement  the debt refinancing with conexant and current trends  the company expects to generate sufficient operating cash to meet our short term and long term cash requirements 
other matters inflation did not have a significant impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended september  in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and eliminates the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations 
sfas no 
also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of october  the company will then have up to six months from october  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
we may be required to record a substantial transitional impairment charge as a result of adopting sfas no 
management is assessing the impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s financial statements 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  subject to the transitional impairment test  is approximately million at september  in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
adoption of sfas no 
is required no later than the beginning of fiscal management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of long lived assets 
in april the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
s   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  effective for fiscal years beginning may  or later 
it rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt  sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt to satisfy sinking fund requirements  and sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we do not believe the impact of adopting sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we are assessing the impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries forward looking statements this report and other documents we have filed with the sec contain forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terms such as believes  expects  may  will  should  could  seek  intends  plans  estimates  anticipates or other comparable terms 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
we urge you to consider the risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in the other documents filed with the sec in evaluating our forward looking statements 
we have no plans to update our forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
certain business risks we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and anticipate future losses 
our operating results have been adversely affected by a global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions 
as a result  we incurred substantial operating losses during the twelve month period ended september  we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  changes in our revenue mix and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term 
in order to become profitable  we must achieve substantial revenue growth and we will face an environment of uncertain demand in the markets for our products 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will become profitable or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
we operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time these and other factors  together with changes in general economic conditions  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry 
periods of industry downturns  as we experienced through most of calendar year  have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
these factors  and in particular the level of demand for digital cellular handsets  may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations 
we have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the future 
during the late s and extending into  the wireless communications semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth  benefiting from the rapid expansion of wireless communication services worldwide and increased demand for digital cellular handsets 
during calendar year  we were adversely impacted by a global economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our respective wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions  particularly digital cellular handsets 
the impact of weakened end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of inventories among our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  subcontractor and distributor customers 
we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term 
we are subject to intense competition 
the wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are intensely competitive 
we compete with us and international semiconductor manufacturers that are both larger and smaller than us in terms of resources and market share 
we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue 
this competition has resulted and is expected to continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
we also anticipate that additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our market include  among others time to market  new product innovation  skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries product quality  reliability and performance  price  compliance with industry standards  strategic relationships with customers  and protection of intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors 
many of our competitors have advantages over us  including longer presence in key markets  greater name recognition  ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property  and greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical or other resources 
as a result  certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect customers purchasing decisions 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner 
the markets into which we sell demand cutting edge technologies and new and innovative products 
our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis 
successful product development and introduction depends on numerous factors  including the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards  the ability to define new products that meet customer and market requirements  the ability to complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis  the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors  and overall market acceptance of our products 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner 
we will be required continually to evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost effective manner  that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors 
in addition  prices of established products may decline  sometimes significantly  over time 
we believe that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive 
we may not be able to keep abreast of the rapid technological changes in our markets 
the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate 
our markets generally exhibit the following characteristics rapid technological developments  rapid changes in customer requirements  skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries frequent new product introductions and enhancements  short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product  and evolving industry standards 
our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or in market demand for products based on a particular technology  particularly due to the introduction of new technology that represents a substantial advance over current technology 
currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change  which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products 
our success could be negatively affected if key personnel leave 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our key technical personnel represent a significant asset 
the competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products 
we may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance  given  among other things  the use of equity based compensation by us and our competitors 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
if oems of communications electronics products do not design our products into their equipment  we will have difficulty selling those products 
moreover  a design win from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer 
our products will not be sold directly to the end user but will be components of other products 
as a result  we will rely on oems of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
without these design wins from oems  we would have difficulty selling our products 
once an oem designs another supplier s product into one of its product platforms  it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that oem product platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that oem 
also  achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer 
even after a design win  the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products  for example  if its own products are not commercially successful  or for any other reason 
we may be unable to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales 
because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products  we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products 
our customers may need three to six months to test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
the lengthy period of time required increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products  and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if our customer cancels or changes its product plans 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales will typically be made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term supply arrangements with our customers 
our customers may cancel orders prior to shipment 
additionally  we will sell a portion of our products through distributors  some of whom will have rights to return unsold products 
we may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products  or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize  could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in inventory write downs 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
a significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we lost one or more of these major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of our products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
sales to samsung electronics co 
and to motorola  inc represented approximately and  respectively  of net revenues from customers other conexant during fiscal on a historical basis such sales representing washington mexicali sales for the fiscal year through june   and sales of skyworks  the combined company  for the post merger period from june  through the end of the fiscal year 
our future operating results will depend on the success of these customers and other customers and our success in selling products to them 
we face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it 
we may need to obtain sources of financing in the future 
after giving effect to the net proceeds we received in our private placement of percent convertible subordinated notes due and our debt refinancing with conexant  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditure  working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
conditions existing in the us capital markets when the company seeks financing will affect our ability to raise capital  as well as the terms of any financing 
the company may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all 
failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources 
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future 
our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized 
our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption due to causes beyond our control 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps 
it requires production in a highly controlled  clean environment 
minor impurities  errors in any step of the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer not to function 
our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields 
our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors 
these disruptions may include electrical power outages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor 
in the event of these types of delays  we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity  particularly wafer production capacity  would be available on a timely basis or at all 
even if alternative wafer production capacity is available  we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms  which could result in higher costs and or a loss of customers 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others 
due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process  in the event of a disruption at the newbury park  california or woburn  massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities  alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be immediately available from third party sources 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries we may not be able to achieve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability 
minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss  and in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing  and typically increase as we bring the product to full production 
our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and  as a result  material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability 
the difficulty of forecasting manufacturing yields accurately and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products 
our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles  which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without  in many cases  reaching the longer term  high volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs 
we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture  assembly and test of our products 
we rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities  called foundries  to provide silicon based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on third party foundries  including the lack of ensured wafer supply  potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  production costs and product quality  and the inaccessibility of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
although we have long term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity  the third party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers 
if we choose to use a new foundry  it will typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
the foundries may experience financial difficulties  be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities  particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones 
if any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs  we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available 
we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products  which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we also intend to utilize subcontractors to package  assemble and test a portion of our products 
because we rely on others to package  assemble or test our products  we are subject to many of the same risks as are described above with respect to foundries 
we are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components 
we believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world 
however  we are currently dependent on two suppliers for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities 
nevertheless  while we historically have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining an adequate supply of raw materials  including epitaxial wafers  and components necessary for our manufacturing operations  we cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
under a supply agreement entered into with conexant in connection with the merger  we receive wafer fabrication  wafer probe and certain other services from jazz semiconductor  inc  a newport beach  california foundry joint venture between conexant and the carlyle group 
pursuant to our supply agreement with conexant  we are initially obligated to obtain certain minimum volume levels from jazz semiconductor based on a contractual agreement between conexant and jazz semiconductor 
our expected minimum purchase obligations under this supply agreement are anticipated to be approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and we estimate that our minimum purchase obligation under this agreement will result in excess costs of approximately million and we have recorded this liability and charged cost of sales in fiscal skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally 
historically  a substantial majority of the company s net revenues from customers other than conexant were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily countries located in the asia pacific region and europe 
in addition  we have suppliers located outside the united states and third party packaging  assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the asia pacific region 
our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad 
these include  but are not limited to  risks regarding currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  disruptions of capital and trading markets  restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  the laws and policies of the united states and other countries affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and import or export licensing requirements  tax laws  and limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property 
because our international sales are denominated in us dollars our products could become less competitive in international markets if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies 
moreover  we may be competitively disadvantaged relative to our competitors located outside the united states who may benefit from a devaluation of their local currency 
we cannot assure you that the factors described above will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our international sales 
our operating results may be negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues  earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others changes in end user demand for the products principally digital cellular handsets manufactured and sold by our customers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from our suppliers  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  new product and technology introductions by competitors  changes in the mix of products produced and sold  market acceptance of our products and our customers  intellectual property disputes  seasonal customer demand  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  and the timing and extent of product development costs 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries our gallium arsenide semiconductors may not continue to be competitive with silicon alternatives 
we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components  principally power amplifiers and switches 
the production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits 
as a result  we must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance to that of silicon for specific applications to be competitive with their respective silicon products 
if we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
it is expected that the costs of producing gallium arsenide integrated circuits will continue to exceed the costs associated with the production of silicon circuits 
the costs differ because of higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes 
silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance superior to that offered by silicon solutions 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology 
at the present time  we are in discussions with a third party who claims we are infringing certain of their intellectual property rights 
the third party has filed a complaint in this matter but has not yet served skyworks with the complaint 
although we believe that these claims are without merit  we are in discussions with this party to avoid litigation 
the third party has indicated its willingness to resolve these claims without litigation if this third party were to proceed with litigation  we are prepared to vigorously defend against these claims 
moreover  we believe that the patent infringement claims that were asserted would impact only a limited number of our rf ic product line which presently accounts for less than of our annualized revenues 
any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe these rights  including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
regardless of the merits of any specific claim  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if litigation were to result in an adverse ruling  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  import  use  sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes  discontinue the use of infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  it may harm our ability to compete 
we rely on patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies  devices  algorithms and processes 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties into our designs  and we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such third party intellectual property 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take to prevent misappropriation  infringement  dilution or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers  suppliers or other third parties will be successful  any existing or future patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
if any of our patents fails to protect our technology  it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products  potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to effect suitable investments  alliances and acquisitions  and we may have difficulty integrating companies we acquire 
skyworks merger with the wireless business of conexant presents such risks 
although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities  the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own 
on an ongoing basis  we intend to review investment  alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment  alliance or acquisition transactions in the future 
moreover  if we consummate such transactions  they could result in issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders  large one time write offs  the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities  the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company  amortization expenses related to intangible assets  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
additionally  in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult  expensive  time consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful 
we may be responsible for payment of a substantial amount of us federal income and other taxes upon certain events 
in connection with conexant s spin off of its wireless business prior to the merger  conexant sought and received a ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that certain transactions related to and including the spin off qualified as a reorganization and as tax free for us federal income tax purposes 
while the tax ruling generally is binding on the internal revenue service  the continuing validity of the ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
in connection with the merger we entered into a tax allocation agreement with conexant that generally provides  among other things  that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on various persons including conexant as a result of either the failure of certain spin off transactions to qualify as a reorganization for us federal income tax purposes  or the failure of certain spin off transactions to qualify as tax free to conexant for certain us federal income tax purposes  if such failure is attributable to certain actions or transactions by or in respect of skyworks including our subsidiaries or our stockholders  such as the acquisition of stock of skyworks by a third party at a time and in a manner that would cause such failure 
in addition  the tax allocation agreement provides that we will be responsible for various other tax obligations and for compliance with various representations  statements  and conditions made in the course of obtaining the tax ruling referenced above and in connection with the tax allocation agreement 
our obligations under the tax allocation agreement have been limited by a letter agreement dated november  entered into in connection with our debt refinancing with conexant 
nevertheless  if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with the requirements imposed as a result of the spin off and related transactions and our responsibilities under the tax allocation agreement  we might inadvertently trigger an obligation to skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries indemnify certain persons including conexant pursuant to the tax allocation agreement or other obligations under such agreement 
in addition  our indemnity obligations could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire skyworks 
if we were required to pay any of the taxes described above  the payment could be very substantial and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  it is expected that the interest payments we are required to make on the million principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due june  issued to conexant will not be deductible for us federal income tax purposes 
our inability to offset our interest expense from these obligations against other income may increase our tax liability currently and in future years 
further  the terms of the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  issued to conexant require us to pay the principal due at the maturity date or upon certain acceleration events in a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal due at such time divided by the applicable conversion price on such date 
if the fair market value of our common stock on such date is less than the applicable conversion price of such notes  we may recognize cancellation of indebtedness income for federal income tax purposes equal to the excess of the principal amount of such notes due at such time over the fair market value of the common stock issued by us to satisfy our obligations under the notes 
certain provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us 
we have certain anti takeover measures that may affect our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and the delaware general corporation law contain several provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions such as the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis  one class each year  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by laws or the provision of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by laws  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors  the classified board or the right to act by written consent  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors and  in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of or more of our shares  a majority of the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of or more of our shares  a fair price provision  and a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision 
in addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  section of the delaware general corporation law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder  unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met 
we may be liable for penalties under environmental laws  rules and regulations  which could adversely impact our business 
we have used  and will continue to use  a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the united states 
while we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations as a result of such regulations  we cannot assure you that current or future regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action regardless of fault 
consequently  it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters  including potential liabilities 
we cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities  to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries we will adopt new accounting policies in fiscal that could negatively impact our earnings for that year 
in our fiscal year  which began on september   we must adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this policy will require us to evaluate the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives that we report on our balance sheet for potential impairment using a fair value method 
if we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired  we will be required to report non cash charges to our earnings in fiscal year in the amount of such impairment 
at september   we reported goodwill and intangible assets of  as a result  the adoption of sfas no 
may result in asset write downs on our balance sheet and significant non cash charges to earnings in fiscal management is assessing the impact that adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 
this price may be influenced by many factors  including our performance and prospects  the performance and prospects of our major customers  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate  changes in earnings estimates or buy sell recommendations by analysts  general financial and other market conditions  and domestic and international economic conditions 
public stock markets have experienced  and are currently experiencing  extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in the technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
for so long as the percent convertible subordinated notes we issued in a private placement in november remain outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately  per year in interest payments 
in addition  we have extended the maturity of certain outstanding debt under a financing agreement with conexant  as amended  which bears interest at a rate of per year 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other long term debt  lines of credit and other financing 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  skyworks solutions  inc and subsidiaries limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our long term debt consists of a ten year  loan from the state of maryland under the community development block grant program 
quarterly payments are due through december and represent principal plus interest at of the unamortized balance 
our short term debt on september  consists of the current portion of this loan 
in addition  because we refinanced the note payable to conexant for the acquisition of the mexicali operations and our loan facility with conexant  the principal amount of million was classified as long term debt on september  we do not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our short term or long term debt
