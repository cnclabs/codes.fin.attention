business overview we are the world leaders in developing and manufacturing compound semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from sic and a leading developer and manufacturer of optoelectronic and electronic devices made from gan and related materials on sic substrates 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of near ultra violet  or uv  blue and green light emitting diodes or leds 
we currently offer leds at three brightness levels xbright tm uv  blue and green products  mid brightness uv  blue and green products  which include megabright tm  ultrabright tm and high brightness ingan devices  and standard brightness blue products 
our led devices are utilized by end users as a lighting source for wireless handsets  automotive dashboard lighting  indicator lamps  miniature white lights  indoor and outdoor full color displays and signs  traffic signals and other lighting applications 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract 
when our inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized when our customer pulls products for their use 
led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue came from the sales of rf and microwave devices from our cree microwave segment 
these rf power transistors are the semiconductor content for power amplifiers that are used in base stations for cellular networks 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advanced materials made from sic that are used for manufacturing leds and power devices by our customers  or for research and development for new semiconductor applications 
sales of sic material products represented of our revenue in fiscal and approximately during fiscal we received no significant revenues from sales of power devices or sic based rf devices in fiscal or fiscal the balance of our revenue  for fiscal and in fiscal is derived from contract funding 
under various programs  us government entities further the development of our technology by funding our research and development efforts 
contract revenue includes funding for direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract  we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses 
fiscal overview we completed the introduction of our megabright tm led line during fiscal with the commercial release of three new products the megabright tm uv device  the traffic signal green device and the true green device used for display signs and other lighting applications 
the megabright tm blue device was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the uv device offers an alternative path to white light compared to the megabright tm blue led 
some customers prefer a blue led covered with a yellow emitting phosphor to create white light 
other customers believe the uv led with red  green and blue emitting phosphors provides a preferable white light emission 
combining a red  green and blue led  or a blue and yellow led  in an appropriate package are other means of creating white light solid state lamps 
a traffic signal made of green leds offers lower power consumption at watts versus watts for an incandescent bulb in certain cases 
consequently  municipalities and other government organizations are choosing to install led traffic signals due to reduced energy consumption resulting in lower electricity bills and reduced maintenance costs due to the longer lifetimes of leds 
applications for the true green device target full color indoor and outdoor video displays including sports stadiums and large advertising panels 
the use of blue and green leds in full color outdoor signs is a well established market  and one of the primary applications for nitride leds 
the megabright tm product line was an important revenue stream for fiscal and has replaced some demand for our older high brightness products 
our high brightness product line had the biggest percentage decline in revenue compared to fiscal for fiscal  we will combine results for our megabright tm  ultrabright tm and high brightness devices for reporting purposes and reflect these sales as our mid brightness products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our mid brightness chips comprised of led sales 
we also introduced the xbright tm family of leds during fiscal this new product family delivers to our customers increased brightness by approximately percent over the megabright tm family of leds 
target applications for the xbright tm devices include miniature white lights  traffic signals and video screens 
the xbright tm led technology incorporates a flip chip design and utilizes the optical benefits of sic while maintaining the vertical structure advantages of a single top contact 
this allows for a standard size chip similar to our other devices 
we offer a complete product family of xbright tm leds uv  blue  traffic green and true green 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we continued to work through packaging difficulties encountered by some of our customers in using our xbright tm products 
as a result  xbright tm leds comprised only of led revenue in the quarter 
we modified the chip after its initial introduction in response to customer packaging suggestions  and we target to increase the sales volume of this product in the first half of fiscal customer interest in the product remains strong  as we believe the xbright tm chip is the brightest which is defined as the optical power output from a chip at milliamps of drive current based on our internal measurement nitride led currently available in the marketplace 
shipments of our standard brightness devices remained stable in fiscal in comparison to fiscal and were supported by automotive and indicator light designs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  standard brightness products were approximately of led revenue 
revenue from cree microwave was million during fiscal our biggest challenge for cree microwave will be to diversify our spectrian concentrated business 
however  due to the weak economic environment for microwave devices and the long qualification process for our products  we believe that this diversification will develop over many quarters 
in the near term  our goal is to complete qualification of the new laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor  or ldmos products during the first quarter of fiscal if we fail to attain this goal  revenue from this segment will likely decline in future quarters 
our supply agreement with spectrian  cree microwave s largest customer  allows the customer to reduce its purchase obligations significantly 
overall  for fiscal  materials revenue declined over the prior year due to a reduction in gemstone sales and a decrease in wafer sales 
sales of material for use in gemstones were lower in the current year as charles colvard  or c c  our sole customer for such materials  had built up inventory in fiscal as their sales slowed 
during fiscal  wafer volume for our material sales increased while average sales prices declined year over year due to greater sales to volume customers using our product for commercial applications 
government contract revenue increased in fiscal over the prior year as we received several new contract awards during fiscal our government contract backlog exceeds million as of june   and we target contract revenue to increase during fiscal due to these new awards  subject to the government s ability to terminate or reduce funding under the contracts 
during the past year  we utilized a greater proportion of our equipment and infrastructure to perform research and development work to support the commercialization of new products as reflected in the introduction of our megabright tm and xbright tm products 
we believe that  over the next several quarters  this production capacity will be required to support the growth in demand generated by our customers recent design wins incorporating our products 
during fiscal  we target to increase our throughput  subject to the acceptance of our products by our customers and market conditions 
as volume throughput rises  our cost of led chips and unit wafer costs are anticipated to decline as fixed costs are spread over more units 
critical accounting policies 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies include those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which potentially could produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of june   including approximately million related to fixed assets and million in long term investments held to maturity 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of our policy elections  including estimated useful lives  salvage values and in  impairment charges 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas  we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets have been impaired 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimations of the fair market value of the assets  and ii estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations and estimated salvage values 
during  we determined certain property and equipment was impaired under sfas and as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we completed an impairment analysis of the intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition of cree microwave 
this analysis was performed due to significant changes in business conditions at the operating segment 
first  cree microwave amended its supply agreement with spectrian effective march   which resulted in a significant reduction in quarterly revenue expectations 
in addition  cree microwave s outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term weakened due to the deteriorating economic conditions and long product qualification cycles 
also  many of the products that spectrian indicated it would purchase in the future have not yet been released to production 
under the amended supply agreement  if cree microwave is not able to produce ldmos devices qualified for spectrian s applications in a timely manner  revenue from spectrian may be significantly reduced after the june quarter 
as a result of this impairment analysis  the remaining balance of intangible assets and goodwill of million was deemed fully impaired and was written off 
accounting for marketable and non marketable equity securities 
we classify our marketable securities that are not trading or held to maturity securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized upon sale or disposition or when declines in value are deemed to be other than temporary in accordance with sfas accounting for certain debt and equity securities 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy requires  among other things  a review of each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance  liquidity  ability to raise capital and management ownership 
based on this review  if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in the value of one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value 
the related write down will then be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recorded an other than temporary investment loss of million related to our available for sale marketable securities based primarily on sustained reductions in stock price performance 
we also make strategic investments in the equity of privately held companies 
since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of these companies  these investment balances are carried at cost and accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
since the shares of stock we received in these investments are not publicly traded  there is no established market for these securities 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of such investments 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from the privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a write down of the investment 
this write down is estimated based on the information described above  and it is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recorded a write down on these investments of million  representing our best estimate of other than temporary declines in value based on a review of those factors described above 
estimating the fair value of non marketable investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities  impairment of value and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers  sales team and management estimates 
we generally reserve for inventories on hand that are greater than twelve months old  unless there is an identified need for the inventory 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions  which eliminate demand for existing products 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million reserve at our cree microwave segment for non ldmos and older ldmos devices as a result of contract negotiations with spectrian that identified these devices as obsolete 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of  related to our initial shipments of the xbright tm family of products due to a packaging issue identified by some of our customers 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
in some cases our inventory is maintained at a consigned location  in that situation  revenue is recognized as our customer pulls inventory for their use 
we provide our customers with a limited right of return 
revenue is recognized at shipment or when product is pulled from consigned inventory  and we record a reserve for sales returns 
we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
significant judgments and estimates made by management are used in connection with establishing the allowance for sales returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the allowance for sales returns at june  was accruals for liabilities and warranties 
at times  we must make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for general services  including legal and accounting fees  costs pertaining to our self funded medical insurance  warranty costs at cree microwave and other expenses 
many of these expenses are estimated based on historical experience or averages and information gained directly from the service providers 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
as of june   the company had million recorded as deferred tax assets 
these assets were recorded as a result of tax benefits associated with the million of significant charges taken in fiscal these charges were recorded for the write off of property and equipment  the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at cree microwave and other charges resulting from the downturn in business and the other than temporary charges taken on our investments 
we did not record a reserve against these deferred tax assets as we target a return to profitable operations over the next several periods and target being able to use the deferred tax assets in their entirety 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgement in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k which contain a discussion of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
results of operations the following table shows our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended june  june  june  revenue product revenue  net contract revenue  net total revenue cost of revenue product revenue  net contract revenue  net total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative 
intangible asset amortization in process research and development costs other expense loss income from operations other non operating expense income interest income  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to lower product revenue  which declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding results of cree microwave  due to its mid year acquisition in fiscal  revenue for fiscal would have decreased over the prior year comparative results 
much of the decrease in revenue from our traditional business resulted from lower average selling prices for our led and sic wafer products 
average led sales prices declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior year 
this decrease was related to contractual volume discounts given to customers and increasing price competitiveness in the marketplace due to weakness in the worldwide economy 
we believe that the overall demand for nitride leds declined during our fiscal however  our overall market share has recently increased as a result of our lower pricing and the introduction of higher brightness products 
for fiscal  our led chip volume increased over prior year shipments 
the introduction of the megabright tm uv  blue  and green products in fiscal has generated new design wins for our customers 
the megabright tm product is approximately two times brighter than our previous generation devices and is similar to the brightness that is currently offered by our primary competitors 
prior to the introduction of the megabright tm product line  our products were not as bright as those offered by our competition 
the megabright tm product line was not fully introduced until february  when our green devices were released 
these products have replaced some existing demand for our previous generation high brightness devices  however  due to the product s higher performance  it has also generated new demand  particularly in the mobile handset market 
we believe that volume shipments of the megabright tm product will increase in fiscal due to new design wins primarily in the mobile handset market 
several large wireless phone manufacturers have recently introduced new products that feature a blue backlight of the keypad and  at times  a blue color for the display 
in addition  newer designs now offer white backlighting for full color screens that require white leds 
we believe that our products are featured in several of these models of phones  and blue and white backlit phones have grown significantly as a percentage of handsets currently offered by major manufacturers 
we also believe that the blue and white leds have replaced a portion of the yellow green leds that have traditionally backlit mobile handsets 
our products will also target new automotive designs in fiscal as well as other consumer product applications 
during fiscal  we also introduced our new xbright tm families of leds  including uv  blue and green devices 
these products offer approximately higher brightness than our megabright tm products  and we believe they are currently the highest brightness uv  blue and green products available in the market place 
we completed the introduction of these devices in the second half of fiscal these devices did not contribute significantly to revenue in fiscal  as we continue to work with customers to optimize our chip design in packaged solutions 
we are targeting these products to be more significant to revenue in fiscal for high brightness applications such as display signs  traffic signals and lighting applications 
shipments of our standard brightness products were flat in fiscal in comparison to the prior year due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
we target that our led revenue may grow significantly in our first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to increased volume shipments 
we also believe that average sales prices for leds will decline in fiscal however  we are targeting unit shipments to grow at a faster rate than average sales price declines  and as a result  we target higher revenue in fiscal over fiscal led revenue visibility beyond the first quarter of fiscal is limited due to short lead times given to us by customers 
in addition  we must complete additional improvements to our chip design and performance in order to succeed with our led revenue targets for fiscal revenue from cree microwave increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue represents an additional six months of sales for the segment due to our mid year acquisition of cree microwave from spectrian in fiscal our average quarterly revenue in fiscal was lower than fiscal due to the current market environment for wireless infrastructure spending 
product mix shifted to ldmos during fiscal  which comprised of microwave revenue  an increase of from fiscal revenue attributable to bipolar devices was and related to other products during fiscal over of cree microwave revenues were derived from shipments to spectrian in fiscal as well as fiscal overall  our average sales prices for this business segment were fairly stable with quarterly average volume being reduced in fiscal as compared to fiscal cree microwave continues to work with spectrian to qualify and deliver new ldmos products for next generation wireless base station applications 
if we are unable to deliver qualified ldmos products to spectrian on a timely basis  the amount of our contractual supply agreement with spectrian may be reduced significantly 
specifically  until we complete the qualification of ldmos parts and the parts are accepted by spectrian  we anticipate minimal revenue from this segment of our business 
if our revenue is reduced substantially  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for this segment of business 
we continue to work on new customer design wins  however  due to long product qualification cycles in the rf industry  progress in this area will require a longer time commitment 
as a result of continued weakness in market conditions for wireless infrastructure spending  combined with a reduced supply agreement with spectrian that calls for a remaining million of revenue through june  we target revenue from this segment to decline in fiscal from fiscal overall  for fiscal  materials revenue declined over the prior year due to a reduction in gemstone sales and a decrease in wafer sales 
sic wafer sales decreased from the prior year due to lower pricing for wafers sold to corporate and research communities  including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production 
wafer units sold increased  while average sales prices declined due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers used in commercial production 
for fiscal  we target wafer sales revenue to be even with fiscal results 
sales of gemstone products declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a modest recovery in revenue from c c and target revenue improvement from this customer during fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies and non governmental customers increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to additional contract awards 
we anticipate that contract revenue will increase during fiscal as a result of new contract awards received in the second half of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior year  gross margins declined from to of revenue 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million charge relating to an inventory write off and other related costs that were recorded as a part of the downsizing of cree microwave s operations 
without this adjustment  gross profit and gross margin for fiscal would have been million and  respectively 
lower margins resulted from a combination of lower revenue and reduced profitability for led and wafer products and lower profitability at cree microwave related to weak demand for rf devices 
led margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs 
during fiscal  led average sales prices declined  which was in line with our plans  while costs were only lower 
led costs did not decline as quickly as revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for uv  blue and green led products  which put pressure on average sales prices and lowered our factory throughput 
because a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed  lower throughput typically results in higher costs per unit produced 
in addition  our led costs per unit were higher due to inefficiencies typically associated with new product introductions as we released both the megabright tm and xbright tm family of products during the year 
in our fourth quarter of fiscal  we had product returns and inventory write downs that netted to a  reduction in gross profit related to packaging issues identified by some customers after the release of the xbright tm family of products 
we have redesigned our xbright tm chips and are planning to manufacture the products in volume in the first half of fiscal despite the lower throughput of volume and new product inefficiencies  we were still able to reduce led costs by due to improved yield  cost cutting measures and other efficiencies 
gross margins at cree microwave were during fiscal and were impacted by the million write off of inventory discussed above 
excluding this write down  gross margin would have been of revenue for the cree microwave segment compared to in fiscal low factory throughput due to reduced sales volumes and the qualification of ldmos has significantly impacted our cost per unit 
our greatest opportunity to improve margins would be in yield improvements and the achievement of greater throughput levels in our factory 
for fiscal  we target gross margins to improve slightly as a result of higher throughput in our durham  north carolina facility as well as improved yields due to higher anticipated volume 
depending on our success with the introduction of the ldmos devices at cree microwave  our margins for that segment may increase  remain stable or may decline 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending supported our megabright tm and xbright tm product lines  our large chip led devices as well as new higher brightness led research programs 
in addition  we funded development of our next generation ldmos  sic and gan microwave devices  our schottky diode power program and our uv lasers 
while research and development spending increased  customer support of certain programs decreased  thereby further increasing costs 
finally  the mid year acquisition of cree microwave during fiscal also contributed to the higher spending variance 
without the impact of cree microwave  research and development spending would have increased over the prior year 
we believe our research and development during fiscal is critical to our future revenue growth 
for example  we target that more than of our revenue goal for fiscal will be met with technology developed in fiscal we believe that internal funding for the development of new products will stabilize during fiscal sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in expenses was due mostly to costs associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation 
in addition  costs were higher due to the mid year acquisition of cree microwave during fiscal  higher premiums for directors and officers insurance and greater spending to support the growth of the business 
without the impact of cree microwave  sales and general and administrative expenses would have increased by year over year 
for fiscal  we target that sales  general and administrative costs to remain stable depending on developments in our ongoing patent litigation 
intangible asset amortization and in process research and development costs 
intangible asset amortization increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal nine months of intangible asset amortization was included in fiscal and six months of amortization was included in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of cree microwave in december intangible asset amortization ceased during the fourth quarter of fiscal an analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas see other expense 
prior to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  we were amortizing these assets over periods ranging from five to ten years 
as a result of the acquisition of cree microwave in december  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal associated with acquired in process research and development costs 
other expense 
other expense increased to million during fiscal from  in fiscal this charge was primarily made up of a million charge for goodwill and intangible assets relating to cree microwave in response to several impairment indicators 
cree microwave amended its supply agreement with spectrian in the third quarter of fiscal  which reduced quarterly revenue expectations 
also  many of the products that spectrian indicated that it would purchase in the future have not yet been released to production 
under the amended supply agreement with spectrian  if cree microwave is not able to produce ldmos devices in a timely manner  revenue from spectrian may be significantly reduced after the june quarter 
in addition  the outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term has decreased due to the weakened economy and the long qualification cycles 
due to the change in outlook for business at cree microwave and the reduction in expected revenue per quarter  we performed an asset impairment analysis under sfas as a result of this analysis  the full amount of goodwill and intangible assets of million was written off and recorded as other expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
also included in other expense was  related to severance payments and other expenses related to the downsizing in the cree microwave business 
in addition  a million write off of property and equipment was recorded to reflect changes in technology that resulted in their obsolescence 
other non operating loss income 
other non operating loss income was a loss of million in fiscal compared to  of income in fiscal the fiscal loss was attributable to a million write down of investments made in publicly traded and privately held equity securities 
for publicly traded securities  we reclassified other comprehensive losses from equity to non operating losses in our consolidated statements of operations and recorded additional write downs for the other than temporary declines in the market value of these investments as the stock market has sustained significant declines in value 
in the case of privately held investments  many of the companies were experiencing deteriorating financial conditions and or an inability to raise additional capital  which represented significant indicators of value impairment 
the fiscal other non operating loss was partially offset by a  gain on the sale of marketable securities during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  a million write down was taken to establish a reserve for investments made in privately held companies that were considered to have an other than temporary impairment to value 
in addition  we made a one time pledge of a charitable contribution of million to the university of california at santa barbara to endow a cree chair in solid state lighting and displays and for other uses 
finally  a  charge was recorded related to one time charges for expenses incurred for the acquisition of nitres 
these charges were offset by a million gain on the sale of marketable securities during the year 
interest income  net 
interest income  net has decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to significantly lower interest rates available in fiscal in addition  slightly lower cash amounts were available as million was used to repurchase our own stock during fiscal income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit expense for fiscal was a benefit of million compared to an expense of million in fiscal the fiscal income tax benefit resulted from significant charges of million taken during the year 
these charges included the write off of property and equipment due to changes in technology  the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at cree microwave and other charges relating to the downturn in business  and an other than temporary decline in fair value of marketable and privately held securities 
our effective tax rate during fiscal was compared to in fiscal at june   we also maintained million of deferred tax assets that were not reserved for by us as we target to return to profitable operations over the next several periods and target being able to use the assets in their entirety 
the minimum amount of future taxable income that will be required to realize existing deferred tax assets is approximately million  million of which will need to occur within the next years to offset existing net operating losses 
the new tax act  the job creation and workers assistance act of will allow us to recover past alternative minimum tax that has been paid 
this amount has been recorded as a tax receivable 
the new legislation also allows us more favorable depreciation 
historically  reported taxable income has been significantly lower than income reported for financial reporting purposes 
the primary reasons for this difference are the timing differences for depreciation  stock option deductions for tax purposes  other tax planning strategies  and impairment charges expensed for financial accounting purposes  which are not tax deductible 
fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to higher product revenue  which rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal without the acquisition of cree microwave in december  revenue for fiscal would have increased over the prior year comparative results 
much of the increase in revenue from our traditional business resulted from demand for our led and sic wafer products 
led chip volume increased over units delivered in the prior year 
the largest increase occurred as a result of the introduction of our ultrabright tm product line in fiscal during fiscal only our high brightness and standard brightness product lines were available for sale 
our standard brightness products also increased in fiscal in terms of units shipped over the prior year due to strong demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
average led sales prices declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior year average due to expected contractual volume discounts given to customers 
sic wafer sales increased over the prior year due to demand from corporate and research customers  including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production 
wafer units sold increased  while average sales prices declined due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers used in commercial production 
sales of gemstone products declined during fiscal year as compared to fiscal due to inventory reduction efforts at c c 
revenue from cree microwave was million for fiscal this represents six months of sales for the unit as it was acquired in december and accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
since we acquired cree microwave in december  there were no sales for this unit in fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies and non governmental customers increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to additional contract awards 
seven new contract awards were received during fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior year  gross margins declined from to of revenue 
lower margins resulted from a combination of reduced profitability for led devices and the acquisition of cree microwave 
led margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs 
during fiscal average led costs declined while average sales prices were reduced 
led costs did not decline as quickly as revenue due to lower yields as a result of new product introductions and chip modifications made to our products in the second half of the year 
in addition  factory throughput was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in higher costs per chip 
the margins for cree microwave averaged as a percentage of revenue due to the competitive environment for ldmos chips 
cree microwave was of total revenue in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal much of this increase resulted from the acquisition of cree microwave  as well as greater investment made for research in the rf and microwave  power and optoelectronic programs 
without the acquisition of cree microwave  research and development expenses would have increased over the prior year 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this increase in expenses is due to the acquisition of cree microwave and greater spending to support the overall growth of the business  as well as costs associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation 
without the acquisition of cree microwave  sales  general and administrative expenses would have increased over the prior year 
intangible asset amortization and in process research and development costs 
the purchase of cree microwave generated goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition of cree microwave  we recorded a one time charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal associated with acquired in process research and development costs 
other expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures as of june   we maintain investments in equity securities that are treated for accounting purposes under sfas as available for sale securities 
these investments are normally carried at fair market value based upon the quoted market price of that investment at the end of the reporting period  with net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
it is our policy to write down these equity investments to their market value and record the related write down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations when the investment has an other than temporary decline in value 
at june   we believe that an other than temporary decline existed in our marketable equity securities and we recorded an other than temporary investment loss of million related to our available for sale marketable securities 
these investments are subject to market risk of equity price changes 
management views these stock holdings as an investment  therefore  the shares are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas the fair market value of these investments as of june   using the closing sale price as of june   was million 
these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 
our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq composite index has shown a decline over the past two years  therefore if there was a adverse change in the market prices  our portfolio would decrease in value by million 
an adverse movement of equity market prices would also have an impact on our portfolio of non marketable strategic equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in  their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales 
at june   our non marketable strategic equity securities had a carrying amount of million 
we have invested some of the proceeds from our january public offering into high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
at june   the company had million invested in these securities 
we currently have no debt outstanding 
qualitative disclosures our investments in publicly traded equity securities are subject to the market risk of equity price changes 
while we cannot predict or manage the future market price for such stock  management continues to evaluate our investment position on an on going basis
