forward looking statements and associated risks this report contains forward looking statements  which mean that suc h statements relate to events or transactions that have not yet occurred  ou r expectations or estimates for our future operations and economic performance our growth strategies or business plans or other events that have not ye t occurred 
such statements can be identified by the use of forward lookin g terminology such as might  may  will  could  expect  anticipate  estimate  likely  believe  or continue or the negative thereof or othe r variations thereon or comparable terminology 
the following paragraphs contai n discussions of important factors that should be considered by prospectiv e investors for their potential impact on forward looking statements included i n this report 
these important factors  among others  may cause actual results t o differ materially and adversely from the results expressed or implied by th e forward looking statements 
we have reported net losses of   an d  for the years ended december   december  an d december   respectively 
at december   we had an accumulate d deficit of  and negative working capital of 
thes e factors and other concerns have caused our accountants to include a goin g concern exception in their report in connection with their audit of ou r financial statements for the year ended december  we expect to continue to experience losses  in the near term  until suc h time as our cymedix r software products can be successfully deployed wit h customers and produce revenue 
the current operation of our business and ou r ability to continue to develop and market our cymedix software products wil l depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing 
at present  we are no t receiving any significant revenues from the sale of our cymedix softwar e products 
we are attempting to meet our current cash flow needs by raisin g capital in the private debt and equity markets and through the exercise o f currently outstanding warrants 
the development and marketing of the cymedi x software products require substantial capital investments 
there can be n o assurance that additional investments or financings will be available to us a s needed to support the development of cymedix products 
failure to obtain suc h capital on a timely basis could result in lost business opportunities  the sal e of the cymedix business at a distressed price or the financial failure of ou r company 
we have recently entered into a secured financing arrangement 
se e business recent developments 
the use of secured borrowings increases th e risk of loss of the assets used to secure the borrowing 
if an event of defaul t occurs under the security agreement  the lender will be able to foreclose on th e assets used to secure the borrowing and sell those assets to the highest bidder in addition  it is generally believed that foreclosure sales  which ar e distress sales  will not maximize the proceeds that are paid for the asset s being sold 
the loan we entered into is secured by the grant of a securit y interest in all medix s intellectual property  including its patent  copyright s and trademarks 
while medix can cure a payment default by the forced conversio n of the loan into its common stock  a bankruptcy or similar event of default wil l trigger the foreclosure provision of the security agreement 
we are still in the process of gaining experience in marketing softwar e products  providing software support services  evaluating demand for products financing a software business and dealing with government regulation of softwar e products 
while we are putting together a team of experienced executives  the y have come from different backgrounds and may require some time to develop a n efficient operating structure and corporate culture for our company 
we believ e our structure of multiple offices serves our customers well  but it does presen t an additional challenge in building our corporate culture and operatin g structure 
our products are in the integration and deployment stages  and have prove n their effectiveness with some sponsors 
we have not yet proven our technolog y with a significant number of physicians 
as a developer of software products  w e will be required to anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards and ne w technological developments 
the market for our software products i s characterized by continued and rapid technological advances in both hardware an d software development  requiring ongoing expenditures for research an d development  and timely introduction of new products and enhancements t o existing products 
the establishment of standards is largely a function of use r acceptance 
therefore  such standards are subject to change 
our future success if any  will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products  t o respond effectively to technology changes  and to introduce new products an d technologies to meet the evolving needs of its clients in the healthcar e information systems market 
the success of our products and services in generating revenue may b e subject to the quality and completeness of the data that is generated and store d by the physician or other healthcare professional and entered into ou r interconnectivity systems  including the failure to input appropriate o r accurate information 
failure or unwillingness by the healthcare professional t o accommodate the required information quality may result in the payor refusing t o pay medix for its services 
the introduction of software products in that market has been slow due t o the large number of small practitioners who are resistant to change  as well a s the financial investment or workflow interruptions associated with change particularly in a period of rising pressure to reduce costs in the market 
w e are currently devoting significant resources toward the development of products there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development o f these products in a timely fashion or that our current or future products wil l satisfy the needs of the healthcare information systems market 
further  ther e can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will no t adversely affect our competitive position or render our products or technologie s noncompetitive or obsolete 
certain of our products provide applications that relate to patien t medication histories and treatment plans 
any failure by our products to provid e accurate  secure and timely information could result in product liability claim s against us by our clients or their affiliates or patients 
we maintain insuranc e that we believe currently is adequate to protect against claims associated wit h the use of our products  but there can be no assurance that our insuranc e coverage would adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
the limits o f that coverage is  in the aggregate and  per occurrence 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage coul d have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial conditio n or business 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of fund s in litigation  as well as diversion of management time and resources 
we have been granted certain patent rights  trademarks and copyright s relating to its software business 
however  patent and intellectual propert y legal issues for software programs  such as the cymedix products  are comple x and currently evolving 
since patent applications are secret until patents ar e issued  in the united states  or published  in other countries  we cannot b e sure that we are first to file any patent application 
in addition  there can b e no assurance that competitors  many of which have far greater resources than w e do  will not apply for and obtain patents that will interfere with our abilit y to develop or market product ideas that we have originated 
further  the laws o f certain foreign countries do not provide the protection to intellectual propert y that is provided in the united states  and may limit our ability to market ou r products overseas 
we cannot give any assurance that the scope of the rights w e have are broad enough to fully protect our cymedix software from infringement 
litigation or regulatory proceedings may be necessary to protect ou r intellectual property rights  such as the scope of our patent 
in fact  th e computer software industry in general is characterized by substantia l litigation 
such litigation and regulatory proceedings are very expensive an d could be a significant drain on our resources and divert resources from produc t development 
there is no assurance that we will have the financial resources t o defend our patent rights or other intellectual property from infringement o r claims of invalidity 
we have been notified by a party that it believes ou r pharmacy product may infringe on patents that it holds 
we have retained paten t counsel who has made a preliminary investigation and determined that our produc t does not infringe on the identified patents 
at this time no legal action ha s been instituted 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology and no assurance can b e given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalen t proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclos e our proprietary technology or that we can meaningfully protect our rights i n such unpatented proprietary technology 
we will use our best efforts to protec t such information and techniques  however  no assurance can be given that suc h efforts will be successful 
the failure to protect our intellectual propert y could cause us to lose substantial revenues and to fail to reach our financia l potential over the long term 
the healthcare and medical services industry in the united states is in a period of rapid change and uncertainty 
governmental programs have bee n proposed  and some adopted  from time to time  to reform various aspects of th e us healthcare delivery system 
some of these programs contain proposals t o increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates an d otherwise change the operating environment for our customers 
particularly hipaa and the regulations that are being promulgated thereunder are causing th e healthcare industry to change its procedures and incur substantial cost in doin g so 
although we expect these regulations to have the beneficial effect o f spurring adoption of our software products  we cannot predict with any certaint y what impact  if any  these and future healthcare reforms might have on ou r software business 
see business governmental regulation 
in connection with our equity line of credit financing  we have registere d  additional shares with the sec for sale by the providers of th e financing  of which  shares remain available for issuance as of marc h  the resale of the common stock that may be issued by us under th e equity line of credit will substantially increase the number of our publicl y traded shares float 
if existing shareholders perceive that this increase d float is not accompanied by a commensurate increase in value to the company then shareholder value real or perceived will be diluted 
such dilution coul d cause holders of our shares of common stock to sell  thus depressing the pric e of our common stock 
therefore  the very existence of the equity line financin g could depress the market price of our common stock 
the resale of the common stock that will be issued by us under our equit y line of credit financing could depress the market price of our common stock 
th e terms of the equity line provide that we will sell shares of our common stock t o the providers of the financing at of the average of the three lowest of th e daily volume weighted average prices of our common stock during the tradin g day period immediately before our request for the advance 
therefore  since al l of the shares that are issued by us in connection with advances under the equit y line financing will have a built in discount of at least upon issuance this could produce an impetus for the providers of the equity line to resel l their shares sooner or in greater quantity than they would otherwise 
suc h resale could have the effect of depressing our share price 
at march  the company had issued  shares to the equity line providers  all o f which has been sold into the public market 
trading activity related to th e liquidation of these shares shown little correlation to downward movements i n share price 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding as of that date  approximately  shares were issuable upon the exercis e of outstanding options  warrants or other rights  and the conversion o f preferred stock 
most of these shares will be immediately saleable upon exercis e or conversion under registration statements we have filed with the sec 
th e exercise prices of options  warrants or other rights to acquire common stoc k presently outstanding range from per share to per share 
during th e respective terms of the outstanding options  warrants  preferred stock and othe r outstanding derivative securities  the holders are given the opportunity t o profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock  and the exercise o f any options  warrants or other rights may dilute the book value per share of th e common stock and put downward pressure on the price of the common stock 
th e existence of the options  conversion rights  or any outstanding warrants ma y adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional equity financing moreover  the holders of such securities are likely to exercise their rights t o acquire common stock at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain capita l on terms more favorable than could be obtained through the exercise o r conversion of such securities 
see also the impact of our equity line of credi t financing discussed in the following paragraphs 
as with any business  growth in absolute amounts of selling  general an d administrative expenses or the occurrence of extraordinary events could caus e actual results to vary materially and adversely from the results contemplated b y the forward looking statements 
budgeting and other management decisions ar e subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to incorrect decisions an d periodic revisions based on actual experience and external busines s developments  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing  capita l expenditures or other budgets  which may  in turn  affect our results o f operation 
assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respec t to  among other things  future economic  competitive and market conditions  an d future business decisions  all of which are difficult or impossible to predic t accurately and many of which are beyond our control 
although we believe th e assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of th e assumptions could prove inaccurate  and therefore  there can be no assuranc e that the results contemplated in the forward looking statements will b e realized 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward lookin g information included herein  the inclusion of such information should not b e regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives o r plans for the company will be achieved
