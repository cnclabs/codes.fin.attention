item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis by our management is provided to identify certain significant factors that affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies during january  the securities and exchange commission sec published a commission statement in the form of financial reporting release no 
which requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in the fourth quarter of with an effective date of january   implementing a change in accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition 
beginning january   nonrefundable fees received upon entering into collaborative agreements where the company has continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
payments received under the development  promotion  distribution and supply agreement the commercial agreement dated september  with bristol myers squibb company bms and er squibb sons  er  a delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of bms er squibb  relating to erbitux  are being deferred and recognized as revenue based upon the actual product research and development costs incurred to date by bms  er squibb and imclone systems as a percentage of the estimated total of such costs to be incurred over the term of the agreement 
of the  upfront payment we received from bms in september  approximately  was recognized as revenue during the year ended december  the methodology used to recognize revenue previously deferred involves a number of estimates and judgments  such as the estimate of total product research and development costs to be incurred under the commercial agreement 
changes in these estimates and judgments can have a significant effect on the timing of when revenue is recognized 
non refundable milestone payments  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  pursuant to collaborative agreements  other than the commercial agreement with bms  are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone 
research and development funding revenue is derived from collaborative agreements and is recognized in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts 
royalty revenue is recognized when earned and collection is probable 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in contingencies note to the financial statements and item of this k 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 no legal reserve has been established in our financial statements for these matters because we do not believe that a loss is probable at this time 
however  if we deem it probable that an unfavorable ruling in any such legal proceeding will occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the operating results of that period 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
assets are considered to be impaired and written down to fair value if expected associated undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying amounts 
fair value is generally the present value of the expected associated cash flows 
we recently built a product launch manufacturing facility and are building a second commercial manufacturing facility which are summarized in note to the financial statements 
the product launch manufacturing facility is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux and the second commercial manufacturing facility will be a multiuse production facility 
erbitux is currently being produced for clinical trials and potential commercialization 
we believe that erbitux will ultimately be approved for commercialization 
as such  we believe that the full carrying value of both the product launch manufacturing facility and the second commercial manufacturing facility will be recovered 
changes in business conditions in the future could change our judgements about the carrying value of these facilities which could result in the recognition of material impairment losses 
manufacturing contracts as summarized under contract services in commitments  note to the financial statements  we have entered into certain development and manufacturing services agreements with lonza biologics plc lonza for the clinical and commercial production of erbitux 
we have commitments from lonza to manufacture erbitux at the  liter scale through december on december   the estimated remaining future commitments under the amended commercial manufacturing services agreement with lonza were  in and  in if erbitux were not to receive regulatory approval when anticipated it is possible that a liability would need to be recognized for any remaining commitments to lonza 
valuation of stock options we apply apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options and warrants 
accordingly  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant of an option to an employee or member of the board of directors only if the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of grant exceeded the exercise price 
had we applied the fair value based method as defined in sfas no 
instead of apb opinion no 
 our net loss to common stockholders in  and would have been increased by approximately   and  respectively 
in addition  we have granted options to certain scientific advisory board members and outside consultants  which are required to be measured at fair value 
estimating the fair value of equity securities involves a number of judgements and variables that are subject to significant change 
a change in the fair value estimate could have a significant effect on the amount of compensation expense recognized 
see note d 
production costs the costs associated with the manufacture of erbitux are included in research and development expenses when incurred and will continue to be so classified until such time as erbitux may be approved for sale or until we obtain obligations from our corporate partners for supply of such product 
in the event of such approval or obligations from our corporate partners  the subsequent costs associated with manufacturing erbitux for commercial sale will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold when sold 
if erbitux is approved by the united states food and drug administration fda  any subsequent sale of this inventory  previously expensed  will result in revenue from product sales with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company does not have any goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
in august the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for sale to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas overview and risk factors we are a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to advance oncology care by developing a portfolio of targeted biologic treatments  which address the unmet medical needs of patients with a variety of cancers 
our three programs include growth factor blockers  cancer vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors 
since our inception in april  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
we have not derived any revenue from commercial product sales 
as a result of our substantial research and development costs  we have incurred significant operating losses and we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception to december  we expect to incur additional operating losses  which could be substantial 
substantially all of our revenues were generated from collaborative arrangements with our partners 
such revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the status of development of our various product candidates  the time at which we enter into collaborative arrangements with corporate partners that provide for payments to us  and the timing and accounting treatment of payments to us under these agreements  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones  timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us  the addition or termination of research programs or funding support  variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period 
to be commercialized our product candidates will require additional development and clinical testing 
generally  to make a profit we will need to successfully develop  test  introduce and market our products 
it is not certain that any of our products will be successfully developed or that required regulatory approvals to commercialize them can be obtained 
further  even if we successfully develop a product  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture or market that product or that potential customers will buy it 
in december  we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa  a germany based drug company  relating to the development  marketing and sale of erbitux 
under the terms of this agreement which were subsequently amended in august  see below we retained the rights to develop and market erbitux within the united states and canada which we subsequently licensed to bms and er squibb pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement  we granted merck kgaa exclusive rights  except in japan  to develop and market erbitux outside of the united states and canada  we agreed to seek to supply merck kgaa  and merck kgaa agreed to purchase from us  erbitux for conducting clinical trials and the commercialization of the product outside of the united states and canada which we are now currently supplying to merck kgaa  and merck kgaa is currently purchasing from us we along with er squibb pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement will co develop and co market erbitux in japan with merck kgaa  and we granted merck kgaa an exclusive license outside of the united states and canada  without the right to sublicense  to certain of our patents to apply to a humanized antibody to the egf receptor on which merck kgaa currently has in development

this agreement may be terminated by merck kgaa in various instances  including at its discretion on any date on which a milestone is achieved in which case no milestone payment will be made  or for a one year period after first commercial sale of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory  upon merck kgaa s reasonable determination that the product is economically unfeasible in which case merck kgaa is entitled to receive back of up front fees and cash based milestone payments then paid to date  but only out of revenues received  if any  based upon a royalty rate applied to the gross profit from erbitux sales or a percentage of erbitux fees and royalties from a sublicensee on account of the sale of erbitux in the united states and canada 
in august  the company and merck kgaa amended this agreement to provide  among other things  that merck kgaa may manufacture erbitux for supply in its territory and may utilize a third party to do so upon the company s reasonable acceptance 
the amendment further released merck kgaa from its obligations under the agreement relating to providing a guaranty under a  credit facility relating to the build out of the product launch manufacturing facility 
in addition  the amendment provides that the companies have co exclusive rights to erbitux in japan  including the right to sublicense and merck kgaa waived its right of first offer in the case of a proposed sublicense by the company of erbitux in the company s territory

at december   the estimated remaining future commitments under the amended commercial manufacturing services agreement are  in and  in in april  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with merck kgaa with respect to bec and the recombinant gp antigen 
the agreement has been amended a number of times  most recently in december the agreement grants merck kgaa a license  with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec and gp outside north america 
the agreement also grants merck kgaa a license  without the right to sublicense  to use  sell  or have sold  but not to make bec within north america in conjunction with imclone systems 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement we have retained the rights  without the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec in north america in conjunction with merck kgaa and with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold gp in north america

an additional  can be received  of which  has been received as of december   assuming the achievement of further milestones for which merck kgaa will receive equity in imclone systems 
the equity underlying these milestone payments will be priced at varying premiums to the then market price of the common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones 
if issuing shares of common stock to merck kgaa would result in merck kgaa owning greater than of our common stock  the milestone shares will be a non voting preferred stock  or other non voting stock convertible into our common stock 
these convertible securities will not have voting rights 
they will be convertible at a price determined in the same manner as the purchase price for shares of our common stock if shares of common stock were to be issued 
they will not be convertible into common stock if  as a result of the conversion  merck kgaa would own greater than of our common stock 
this limitation is in place through december merck kgaa will pay us a royalty on future sales of erbitux outside of the united states and canada  if any

in consideration for the amendment  we agreed to a reduction in royalties payable by merck kgaa on sales of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory 
in december  we entered into an agreement with lonza to manufacture erbitux at the  liter scale for use in clinical trials by merck kgaa 
we had incurred approximately  for services provided under this agreement  of which  was received from merck kgaa 
the remaining  that is due from merck kgaa is included in the amounts due from corporate partners  in the consolidated balance sheet at december  on january  we executed a letter of intent with lonza to enter into a long term supply agreement 
the long term supply agreement would apply to a large scale manufacturing facility that lonza is constructing 
we expect such facility would be able to produce erbitux in  liter batches 
we paid lonza  for the exclusive rights to reserve and negotiate a long term supply agreement for a portion of the new facility s overall capacity 
under certain conditions  such payment shall be refunded to us 
if we enter into a long term supply agreement  such payment will be creditable to us against the  liter batch price  such credit to be spread evenly over the batches manufactured each year of the initial term of the long term supply agreement 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third party manufacturers on terms acceptable to us 
even if we are able to enter into such agreements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to produce or obtain sufficient quantities for commercial sale of our products 
any delays in producing or obtaining commercial quantities of our products could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have obligations under various capital leases for certain laboratory  office and computer equipment and also certain building improvements  primarily under and financing agreements with finova 
these agreements allowed us to finance the lease of equipment and make certain building and leasehold improvements to existing facilities

the sublease has a term of years  followed by two five year renewal option periods 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately  over the term of the sublease 
in order to induce the sublandlord to enter into the sublease  we made a loan to and accepted from the sublandlord a  note receivable 
the note is secured by a leasehold mortgage on the prime lease as well as a collateral assignment of rents by the sublandlord 
the note receivable is payable by the sublandlord over years and bears interest at in years one through five  in years six through ten  in years eleven through fifteen and in years sixteen through twenty 
in addition  we paid the owner a consent fee in the amount of  on may   we entered into a lease for an approximately  square foot portion of a  square foot building known as parkside avenue  brooklyn  new york and we have leased an adjacent  square foot building know as clarkson avenue  brooklyn  new york  collectively the premises to serve as our new chemistry and high throughput screening facility 
the term of the lease is for five years with five successive one year extensions 
for the year ended december   we have incurred approximately  for the retrofit of this facility to better fit our needs 
the total cost for the retrofit will be approximately  we built a new  square foot product launch manufacturing facility adjacent to the pilot facility in somerville  new jersey 
the product launch manufacturing facility was built on a acre parcel of land we purchased in december for approximately  the product launch manufacturing facility contains three  liter working volume fermenters and is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux 
the cost of the facility was approximately  excluding capitalized interest of approximately  the cost for the facility has come from our cash reserves  which were primarily obtained through the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the product launch manufacturing facility was ready for its intended use and put in operation in july and we commenced depreciation at that time 
we have completed conceptual design and preliminary engineering plans and are currently reviewing detailed design plans for  and proceeding with construction of  the second commercial manufacturing facility 
the second commercial manufacturing facility will be a multi use facility of approximately  square feet and will contain up to fermenters with a total capacity of up to  liters working volume 
the facility will be built on a acre parcel of land that we purchased in july for approximately  the cost of this facility  for two completely fitted out suites and a third suite with utilities only  is expected to be approximately  excluding capitalized interest 
the actual amount may change depending upon various factors 
we have incurred approximately  excluding capitalized interest of approximately  in conceptual design  engineering and construction costs through december  on january  we purchased a acre parcel of land located at route  which is the parcel immediately to the north of chubb way and immediately to the east of chubb way 
the parcel includes a  square foot building   square feet of which is warehouse space and  square feet of which is office space 
the purchase price for the property and improvements was approximately  we intend to use this property for warehousing and logistics for our somerville campus 
total capital expenditures made during the year ended december  were  and primarily included  related to the purchase of equipment for and leasehold improvement costs associated with our corporate office and research laboratories in our new york facility   related to engineering  construction and capitalized interest costs of the product launch manufacturing facility   related to the conceptual design  preliminary engineering plans and construction costs for a second commercial manufacturing facility   related to improving and equipping our pilot manufacturing facility   in computer hardware  software and design and configuration costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and  related to the purchase of land adjacent to the existing pilot manufacturing facility 
we believe that our existing cash on hand and amounts to which we are entitled should enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain marketing and research and development expenditures and certain other payments  some of which are payable upon the achievement of research and development milestones 
such amounts include  in cash based payments under our commercial agreement with bms and er squibb of which  was received on march  and  is payable on march   as well as up to  in equity based milestone payments under our erbitux development and license agreement with merck kgaa and up to  in cash based milestone payments under our bec development agreement with merck kgaa 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us  timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals  timing and cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements  level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and sales capabilities  costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  technological advances  status of competitors  our ability to maintain existing corporate collaborations and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities 
in order to fund our capital needs after  we will require significant levels of additional capital and we intend to raise the capital through additional arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources  including the proceeds of product sales  if any 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our planned operations 
below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than total one year years years after years long term debt    capital lease obligations including interest    operating leases      construction commitments    lonza    total contractual cash obligations      at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire at various dates from through at december  we had research credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates from through under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a corporation s ability to use net operating loss and research credit carryforwards may be limited if the corporation experiences a change in ownership of more than percentage points within a three year period 
since  we have experienced two such ownership changes 
as a result  we are only permitted to use in any one year approximately  of our available net operating loss carryforwards that occurred prior to february similarly  we are limited in using our research credit carryforwards 
we have determined that our november public stock offering  our february private placement of convertible subordinated notes  our august issuance of common stock to merck kgaa associated with an equity milestone payment under the erbitux development and license agreement and our september acquisition agreement with bms did not cause an additional ownership change that would further limit the use of our net operating losses and research credit carryforwards 
of our  in net operating loss carry forwards  we have approximately  available to use in  approximately  available to use in each year from through and approximately  available to use in any of the aforementioned net operating loss carryforwards which are not utilized are available for utilization in future years  subject to the statutory expiration dates of such net operating loss carryforwards
