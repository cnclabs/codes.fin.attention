item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of telecommunications network integration and management solutions in china 
our software products and network services enable our customers to build  maintain  operate  manage and continuously improve their internet and telecommunications infrastructure 
we commenced our operations in texas in and moved our operations from texas to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software solutions revenues in while we source hardware for our customers through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  we conduct the bulk of our business through our wholly owned operating subsidiary  asiainfo technologies china inc  or asiainfo technologies  which is a chinese company 
historically  our customer base was concentrated  with sales to china telecom and its provincial subsidiaries accounting for approximately  and of our revenues net of hardware costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  our customer base has diversified significantly and  at december   approximately of our backlog net of hardware costs was attributable to china telecom  while was attributable to china unicom  was attributable to china mobile and was attributable to china netcom 
in the years ended december  and  we entered into software and network solutions contracts with china netcom with a total contract sum including hardware pass through of approximately million and million  respectively 
edward tian  a director and major shareholder of our company  is the chief executive officer of china netcom 
revenue recognized in and from such contracts was approximately million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable due from china netcom as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe that there are opportunities for us to expand into new business areas and to grow our business both organically and through acquisitions 
on february   we completed our acquisition of bonson information technology holdings limited  or bonson  a leading provider of operation support system solutions to wireless telecommunications carriers in china 
the consideration paid to the former shareholders of bonson consisted of approximately million in cash and approximately million in shares of our common stock 
the cash we have paid and will pay in connection with the acquisition has been and will be paid out of our existing cash reserves 
on a stand alone basis in  we anticipate that bonson will generate net revenue of million to million  operating profit of million to million  and net income of million to million 
bonson s operating results will be consolidated with our operating results from february   and the acquisition is expected to add approximately to cents to our earnings per share 
in view of this acquisition and potential future acquisitions we may engage in  our historical operating results may not be an adequate basis on which to evaluate our prospects 
as of december   we had invested a total of million in our majority owned network security business  marsec system inc  or marsec  which focuses on high end security services for our customers 
marsec generated sales orders net of hardware costs of approximately million in the year ended december   and we anticipate that it will generate total sales orders net of hardware costs of approximately million in marsec s operating results are consolidated with our operating results for financial reporting purposes 
on april   we invested approximately million to acquire a equity interest in intrinsic technology holdings  ltd  or intrinsic  a company organized in the cayman islands and engaged in wireless internet application and development through its two wholly owned subsidiaries in china 
we account for our interest in intrinsic using the equity method 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and cost of revenues under customer contracts  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  investment in affiliate  goodwill and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ form these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and cost of revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  changes in our estimates would impact our future operating results 
warranty obligations 
we record our estimate of warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
while we obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  we record our obligations based on historical experience 
future warranty costs  which vary from our past experience  could require us to adjust our accrual for warranty obligations  thereby impacting our future operating results 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  changes to these allowances may be required  which would impact our future operating results 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
investment in affiliate 
we account for our interest in intrinsic using the equity method 
intrinsic has incurred operating losses since our investment in april sustained operating losses of this affiliate or other adverse events could result in our inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  which may require us to record an impairment charge in the future 
through december   we have not recorded an impairment charge for this investment 
goodwill 
we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge if the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its recorded amount 
through december   we have not recorded an impairment charge for goodwill 
beginning january   we will be required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
litigation 
we record contingent liabilities relating to litigation or other loss contingencies when we believe that the likelihood of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
changes in judgments of outcome and estimated losses are recorded  as necessary  in the period such changes are determined or become known 
any changes in estimates would impact our future operating results 
significant contingent liabilities  which we believe are at least possible  are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues at the beginning of  we reorganized our operations into three strategic business units network integration solutions  operation support system solutions  and service application solutions 
these strategic business units along with marsec  which offers network security solutions comprise our four product offerings 
notwithstanding this organizational structure  we continue to analyze our revenues on the basis of our two principal types of revenues network solutions revenues and software solutions revenues 
for practical reasons  we cannot reclassify and present our financial information to correspond to our four product offerings prior to although each of our strategic business units generates both network solutions revenues and software solutions revenues  in the network integration solutions unit is expected to generate approximately to of our total network solutions revenues net of hardware pass through and the operation support system solutions and service application solutions units are expected to generate approximately of our total software solutions revenues 
although we account for our network solutions revenues on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs that are passed through to our customers  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  which is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers with high value it professional services while gradually outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenues as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenues net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown by business line on this basis years ended december  sources of revenues network solutions net of hardware costs software solutions total revenues net of hardware costs as demonstrated by the foregoing table  software solutions revenues have accounted for an increasing portion of our total revenues net of hardware costs over the past several years  increasing from in to in and we anticipate that software solutions revenues will account for approximately to of our total net revenues for inclusive of bonson 
during  we included as a component of software revenues the software service revenue that had previously been included as a component of network solutions revenue 
such change in classification is consistent with our internal reporting structure through december  we have reclassified prior year amounts to conform with the current year presentation 
backlog 
most of our revenues are derived from customers orders under separate binding contracts for hardware  network solutions and software solutions 
these contracts constitute our backlog at any given time 
revenues for hardware  network solutions and software solutions are recognized during the course of the relevant project  as described in more detail below 
at december   our revenue backlog net of hardware costs was million  of which related to network solutions and of which related to software solutions 
at december  and our backlog net of hardware costs was million and million  respectively 
network solutions revenues 
network solutions revenues consist of hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors  as well as services for planning  design  systems integration and training 
we procure for and sell hardware to our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against letters of credit from our customers 
we believe that as the telecommunications related market in china develops our customers will increasingly purchase hardware directly from hardware vendors and pay us separately for the full value of our professional services 
we generally charge a fixed price for network solutions projects and recognize revenue based on the percentage of completion of the project 
we use labor costs and direct project expenses to determine the stage of completion  except for revenues associated with the procurement of hardware on behalf of the customer 
we recognize such hardware related revenues upon delivery 
since a large part of the cost of a network solutions project often relates to hardware  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenues to fluctuate significantly 
however  these fluctuations do not significantly affect our gross profit because hardware related revenues generally approximate the costs of the hardware 
network solutions projects generally have a life of nine to twelve months  during which there are three key milestones 
the first milestone occurs when the hardware is delivered  which is usually between three and four months after signing the contract 
the second milestone in a network solutions project is at primary acceptance  which usually occurs around five months after hardware delivery 
the third milestone is final acceptance  which occurs when the customer agrees that we have satisfactorily completed all of our work on the project 
software solutions revenues 
software solutions revenues include two types of revenues software license revenues and software service revenues 
software license revenues consist of fees received from customers for licenses to use our software products in perpetuity  up to a specified maximum number of users 
our customers must purchase additional user licenses from us when the number of users exceeds the specified maximum 
our software license revenues also include the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which are part of the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
software service revenues consist of revenues from software installation  customization  training and other services 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from both software licenses and software services has been contract related  meaning that it has been derived from customer orders requiring some modifications or customization of our software 
we recognize all software revenue that is contract related over the installation and customization periods  based on the percentage of completion of the project as measured by labor costs and direct project expenses 
the foregoing network solutions and software solutions revenue recognition policies result in our recognizing certain revenues even though we are not due to receive the corresponding cash payment under the relevant contract 
in the case of hardware sales  the customer typically holds back around to of the hardware contract amount at the time of delivery 
in the case of services  while there may be some down payment  most of the revenues becomes billable at the time of primary acceptance 
the unpaid amounts for hardware and services become payable at the time of final project acceptance  when payment of all unpaid contract amounts is due 
when we recognize revenues for which payments are not yet due  we book unbilled accounts receivable until the corresponding amounts become payable 
cost of revenues network solutions costs 
network solutions costs consist primarily of third party hardware costs  compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in designing and implementing projects  and hardware warranty costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in large projects we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we accrue hardware warranty costs when hardware revenue is fully recognized upon final acceptance 
we obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
we currently accrue of hardware sales to cover potential warranty expenses 
this estimate of warranty cost is based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
software solutions costs 
software license costs consist primarily of packaging and written manual expenses 
the costs associated with creating and enhancing software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
software services costs consist primarily of compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in modifying  customizing or installing our software products and in providing consultation  training and support services 
operating expenses our operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization expenses for goodwill and deferred stock compensation 
operating expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  which have risen as our business has grown and we have hired new personnel 
we review salaries on an annual basis in order to ensure that we remain competitive with the market  and do not foresee the need to make material increases in the near term 
however  we may be required to do so from time to time in the future 
research and development expenses relate almost entirely to the development of new software and the enhancement and upgrading of existing software 
we expense these costs as they are incurred 
we provide most of our officers  employees and directors with stock options 
in the past  we granted a number of options with exercise prices below the fair market value of the related shares at the time of grant  resulting in our incurring deferred compensation expenses 
most of the options granted with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant were issued prior to we do not  however  intend to issue options below fair market value in the future 
therefore  our deferred compensation expenses have been significantly higher historically than we expect them to be in future years 
the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the related shares is amortized over the vesting period of the options and reflected on our income statement as amortization of deferred stock compensation 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we make bad debt provisions for accounts receivable balances based on management s assessment of the recoverability of revenues in accordance with the aging of the accounts receivable 
because our client base is continually expanding to include smaller telecommunications and internet service providers  we revisit our estimates on collectibility on a periodic basis 
taxes except for hardware procurement and resale  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese operating subsidiaries 
our chinese subsidiaries are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
asiainfo technologies  our principal operating subsidiary  is classified as a high technology company for purposes of chinese tax law and  as such  is entitled to preferential tax treatment in china 
asiainfo technologies operated free of chinese state corporate income tax for three years  beginning with its first year of operation  and was entitled to a tax reduction for the subsequent three years 
the tax holiday for asiainfo technologies expired on december  and the tax reduction expired on december  however  asiainfo technologies received a continuation of its preferential tax treatment from the local tax authorities in china for an additional three years  expiring at the end of  which reduces our effective income tax rate to not less than 
in  the effective corporate income tax rate applicable to asiainfo technologies was 
changes in chinese tax laws may adversely affect our future operations 
sales of hardware in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our hardware sales are made through our us parent company and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass these taxes through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
sales of software in china are subject to a value added tax 
however  if the net amount of the value added tax payable exceeds of software sales  the excess portion of the value added tax can be refunded immediately 
we therefore enjoy an effective net value added tax burden of on software license revenues 
this policy is effective until we are also subject to us income taxes on revenues generated in the us  including revenues from our hardware procurement activities in the us and interest income earned in the us foreign exchange substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service component of our network solutions business and software business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of renminbi could reduce the us dollar equivalent of the value of the earnings from  and our investment in  our subsidiaries in china 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues  including hardware pass through  increased to million in  from million in revenues net of hardware costs increased approximately  to million in software solutions revenues were million in  representing of total revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software solutions revenues from the previous year 
we experienced significant net revenue growth in as the overall market for network infrastructure software and solutions continued to grow in china 
although our net revenues in each quarter of grew as compared to the comparable periods in  we experienced a sequential decline in net revenues during the fourth quarter of software solutions revenues were million  down as compared to the preceding quarter  and total net revenues were million  down approximately as compared to the preceding quarter 
this sequential decline was attributable to a slow down in network infrastructure spending resulting from the announcement of the restructuring of certain state controlled telecommunications companies in china  including china telecom 
although the planned restructuring caused some service providers to delay infrastructure expansion and improvement projects  we anticipate that spending will resume in the second half of  and that the restructuring will be a long term driver of telecommunications infrastructure projects in china 
for more information on the restructuring  please see the discussion above under the heading item business industry background 
looking forward  we anticipate that on a pro forma basis inclusive of bonson s operating results  our net revenues will increase to in  from pro forma net revenue of million in we expect software solutions revenues to account for to of total net revenues in cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues decreased to million in  primarily due to a decrease in total hardware costs to million 
this decrease in total hardware costs illustrates our continuing focus on high end solutions as opposed to hardware resale in our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million in while our revenues net of hardware cost increased 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  as compared to in  reflecting a large contribution from our higher margin software solutions revenues and our increasing focus on high end network solutions projects 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses  nearly half of which consisted of sales and marketing expenses  increased to million in sales and marketing expenses for the year grew at a slightly lower rate than total operating expenses  and decreased substantially to million in the fourth quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the immediately preceding quarter 
this decrease was a direct result of effective cost control measures we implemented in the fourth quarter to counteract the impact of the planned telecommunications industry restructuring in china 
research and development expenses increased to million in the growth rate in research and development in was slower as compared to that in because our previous research and development investments have reached a level of scalability 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  and are expected to continue to grow at a relatively low rate as our business continues to achieve economies of scale 
other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  decreased to income of million in from income of million in  primarily due to a decrease in our interest income attributable to lower interest rates and lower cash balances held during the year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to  in from approximately  in  primarily due to an increase in our net income for the year ended december  minority interest 
in  minority interest of  represented the portion of our income before minority interests attributable to the minority shareholders of two of our subsidiaries  marsec and guangdong wangying information technology co 
ltd  or guangdong wangying 
equity in loss of affiliates 
in april  we invested million in intrinsic technology holdings  ltd  or intrinsic  for a interest in that company 
our investment in intrinsic is recorded using the equity method because we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of intrinsic through representation on the company s board of directors 
our share of loss of  includes amortization of goodwill in the amount of approximately  net income loss 
net income increased to million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to a net loss of million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in  from million in network solutions revenues accounted for million of this increase due in large part to the uninet project  which we commenced in on behalf of china unicom 
the uninet project contributed million in hardware costs  which was of our total hardware costs for the year 
revenues net of hardware costs increased approximately  from million in to million in software solutions revenues were million in  representing of revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software solutions revenues of million in the growth in software solutions revenues reflected the overall growth of the internet related software market in china and our increased share of that market  which we believe was attributable to our investments in software related research and development and sales and marketing 
in addition  million of the increase in software solutions revenues was attributable to the value added tax rebates discussed above under the heading taxes 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the high hardware costs incurred in connection with the uninet project  as discussed above 
total hardware costs increased to million in  as compared to million in our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in our high end network solutions engineering personnel 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million in from million in as a partial result of high hardware costs related to the uninet project  gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in  as compared to in however  gross profit as a percentage of revenues net of hardware costs remained relatively constant for at  as compared to in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in  from million in sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of our aggressive marketing of our software products  which included the creation of a department devoted exclusively to software marketing 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased expenditure on research and development in the area of convergent billing software and the aggressive upgrading of our aiobs and aimc software products 
our strategy for was to accelerate spending in sales and marketing and research and development in order to scale our business quickly and take advantage of the rapid acceleration of the build out of china s internet infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in included in this amount was  in amortization of goodwill resulting from an acquisition we completed in the overall increase in general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to increased regulatory compliance and investor relations expenses related to our becoming a public company in march of amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased from million in to million in because deferred stock compensation arising from awards in had been completely amortized and no new deferred stock compensation has arisen since october of other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  increased to income of million in from income of  in  primarily due to interest income on the proceeds of our initial public offering in march of minority interest 
in  minority interest of  represented the portion of our loss before minority interests attributable to the other shareholders of marsec and guangdong wangying 
net loss income 
net loss decreased to million in from million in  because we began generating net income in the second quarter of for the second  third and fourth quarters of  we had net income of approximately   and million  respectively 
selected unaudited quarterly combined results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the four quarters ended december  and we believe this unaudited information has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the annual audited combined financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
we expect that our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly 
three months ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  amounts in thousands of us dollars consolidated statements of operations data revenues network solutions         software solutions         total revenues         cost of revenues         gross profit         operating expenses sales and marketing         general and administrative         research and development         amortization of deferred stock compensation total operating expenses         income loss from operations        net interest income       other income  net income loss before tax       income tax expense benefit  income loss before minority interest       minority interest equity in loss of affiliates net income loss       additional data total revenues net of hardware costs         our revenues and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in particular  our business is characterized by limited numbers of large projects 
as discussed above  the majority of revenues for a project are recognized at the point of hardware delivery 
thus  in any given quarter  we may recognize exceptionally large or exceptionally small amounts of revenue  depending on the timing of hardware delivery and size of the project 
in the fourth quarter of  we benefited from a change in regulations issued in that quarter by the department of finance of beijing  which reduced the contributions  effective the beginning of  we were required to make to the government for prc employee benefits 
as a result  during the fourth quarter we reversed  of costs accrued in the first three quarters of which had previously been expensed  in the first quarter   in the second quarter and  in the third quarter 
our actual results from year to year can vary considerably  particularly as our company grows 
we believe that our business is subject to a certain degree of seasonality 
in particular  orders tend to be slow in the first quarter because of two major chinese holidays during this period  including the chinese lunar new year 
in addition  the chinese government conducts its internal budgetary review and allocation process during this period  which has the effect of delaying project commitments by our customers 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are primarily working capital requirements related to hardware sales and costs associated with the expansion of our business  such as research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we have historically financed our working capital and other financing requirements through careful management of our billing cycle  private placements of our equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
we ended with a strong cash position which included cash and cash equivalent of million  short term investments of million and restricted cash of million for the purpose of securing local currency loans 
our short term investments feature fixed income  liquidity and low risk investments including bank deposits and us government obligations 
the cash equivalents include investments in cash management accounts to enhance our interest income 
our cash position  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  decreased by million as compared to the beginning of of this decrease  million was expended on operating activities  million was used in investment activities including equity investments in intrinsic  a pre acquisition bridge loan we extended to bonson  and purchases of property and equipment  and million was used to retire renminbi denominated borrowings 
in  we anticipate paying approximately million in cash in connection with our acquisition of bonson 
as of december   we had short term credit facilities totaling million  secured by bank deposits of million  expiring by june   for working capital purposes  of which unused short term credit facilities were million at that date 
at december   borrowings under these facilities totaled million  of which million had been used to issue a letter of credit 
additional borrowings of approximately million were secured by bank deposits of million 
all the borrowings were in renminbi  the currency of china 
the loans carry interest of per annum and are repayable within one year 
additional bank deposits of  were used for issuing a standby letter of credit 
bank deposits pledged as security for these bank loans and short term credit facilities totaled million as of december   and are presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we were committed under certain operating leases  requiring annual minimum rentals of approximately million   and  in  and  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
our billed receivables are based on revenue we have booked and billed 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
for example  we recognize revenues for hardware pass through at the time the hardware is accepted by the customer  based on the cost of the underlying hardware 
however  our contracts with our customers will often allow the customers to withhold to of the total contract payments until final project acceptance  which on average is eight to nine months after hardware delivery 
as a result  revenues from hardware pass through generally represent a significant portion of our unbilled receivables and can cause the aging of these receivables to be relatively long 
at the end of  our days sales outstanding were days  a day improvement compared to the end of the third quarter 
billed receivables were days sales outstanding and our unbilled receivables were days sales outstanding 
during  we expect days sales outstanding to decrease slightly from this level 
our inventory position at the end of was approximately million  down from million at the beginning of the year  demonstrating our well managed inventory control process 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
we plan to raise additional funds  if necessary  through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 
in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles such as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas no 
also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we are currently assessing but have not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  that addresses the accounting for the recognition of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas no

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for us on january  sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting requirements for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations 
sfas no 
applies to all recorded long lived assets that are held for use or that will be disposed of  but excludes goodwill and other intangible assets that are not amortized 
management does not believe that the adoption of sfas nos 
and will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government budgetary policy  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry and the internet in china 
virtually all of our large customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the state development and planning commission of china 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications and internet infrastructure 
despite the high priority currently accorded by the government to the development of china s telecommunications industry and internet infrastructure  and a high level of funding allocated by the government to these sectors  insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of china s telecommunications and internet industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
on december   in an effort to increase the efficiency of telecommunications service providers through competition  the state council of china announced that it would split china telecom geographically into a northern division comprising ten provinces and a southern division comprising provinces 
under the state council s plan  the northern division of china telecom will merge with china netcom and jitong communication  and will use the china netcom name  while the southern division will continue to operate under the china telecom name 
as a result of the planned restructuring  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects decreased in the third and fourth quarters of  adversely affecting our backlog and our rate of net revenue growth on a sequential basis 
although we expect that spending will resume in the second half of and that the restructuring will have a positive impact on growth in the telecommunications industry in china in the long term  similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers  such as china telecom  china unicom  china mobile and china netcom 
china telecom accounted for almost all of our revenues in and in  china telecom  together with china unicom  accounted for almost all of our revenues 
at december   china telecom and china unicom accounted for approximately of our backlog net of hardware costs 
the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
laws and regulations applicable to the internet in china remain unsettled and could have a material adverse effect on the internet s growth and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business 
growth of the internet in china could be materially adversely affected by government regulation of the industry 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services  new regulations have been and may continue to be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services 
in september  china s ministry of information industry promulgated the administrative measures on internet information services and related implementing regulations 
among other things  the administrative measures on internet information services 
require internet content providers to obtain approval from the ministry of information industry before they can list securities overseas or obtain foreign investment  
require internet content providers to obtain licenses from various ministries  depending on the nature of the content they provide  and 
require internet content providers to police their content in order to prevent restricted material from appearing on their websites 
because we are engaged in telecommunications and internet infrastructure development  we do not expect these regulations to have a direct impact on us 
however  we cannot guarantee that the adoption of these regulations or other regulations will not slow the growth of the internet or other online services in china 
in particular  the prohibitions against a broad but vague range of information on the internet such as information that is damaging to national security  national interest  and social order  the relevant monitoring  record keeping  reporting and other administrative burdens imposed on internet access and content providers  and the severe penalties for violations of these regulations could have a chilling effect on internet content providers and internet users and could lead to increased compliance costs for internet content providers 
any slowdown in the growth of the internet in china could in turn lead to reduced internet traffic  and a decrease in the demand for our network solutions and software products 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and an extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
other factors that may affect us include the following 
fluctuation in demand for our products and services as a result of the budgetary cycles of our large customers  particularly state owned enterprises  
the reduction  delay  interruption or termination of one or more infrastructure projects  and 
our ability to introduce  develop and deliver new software products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
a large part of the contract amount of a network solutions project usually relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of contract services revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than any corresponding decline in our operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries will require us to increase our working capital needs significantly 
our working capital requirements may also increase significantly in order to fund more rapid expansion and acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressure to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases or otherwise if our business grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
an increase in our working capital needs may require that we raise additional funds sooner than we presently expect 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we have recently achieved operating profitability and had net income in and  we sustained net losses in  and there are no assurances that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
any such developments could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our acquisition of bonson has been  and any acquisitions we undertake in the future may be  costly  and we may realize losses on our investments as a key component of our business and growth strategy  we have recently acquired bonson information technology holdings limited  or bonson 
in the future  we may acquire other companies or assets that we feel will enhance our revenue growth  operations and profitability 
such acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  dilutive issuances of our common stock and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
such acquisitions involve other significant risks  including 
the difficulties of integrating  assimilating and managing the operations  technologies  intellectual property  products and personnel of the acquired business  
the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  
the additional expense associated with acquired contingent liabilities  
the loss of key employees in acquired businesses  and 
the risk of being sued by terminated employees and contractors 
we will need to integrate and manage bonson and any other businesses we determine to acquire in the future 
our failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
management s ability to implement adequate control systems will be critical to the successful management of our future growth 
in recent years  we have been expanding our operations rapidly  both in size and scope 
our growth places a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
our ability to market our products successfully and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we will need to continue to improve our financial  managerial and operational controls and reporting systems  and to expand  train and manage our work force 
our future growth will be compromised if we cannot implement adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
each of our executive officers is responsible for an important segment of our operations 
although we believe that we have significant depth at all levels of management  the loss of any of our executive officers services could be detrimental to our operations 
to ensure continuity of management  we have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers 
we do not have  and do not plan to obtain  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
our failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
since our business has been evolving  our historical financial information may not be an appropriate basis on which to evaluate us or our prospects 
we founded our business in texas in  moved our operations from texas to china in  and began generating significant network solutions revenue in and significant software solutions revenues in we expect our business to continue to evolve as the internet and telecommunications markets in china change and expand 
as a result  our historical financial data may not provide a meaningful basis upon which investors may evaluate us and our prospects 
you should consider the risks and difficulties encountered by companies like ours in a new and rapidly evolving market 
our ability to sell products and our level of success depend  among other things  on the level of demand for telecommunications and internet related  professional it services and software products in china 
we extend warranties to our customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we cap the amounts our customers can recover for damages 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
the failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  that in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our large systems integration projects on a fixed price  fixed time basis which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell substantially all of our systems integration projects on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines of up to of the total contract value 
in large scale telecommunications infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liable for late completion fines 
our failure to complete a fixed price  fixed time project within budget and the required time frame would expose us to cost overruns and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
a part of our business is installing network hardware 
if we are unable to obtain access to such equipment in a timely manner or on acceptable commercial terms  our business  particularly our relationships with our customers  may be materially and adversely affected 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products or enhancements to our software products that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
we continually develop new services and proprietary software products 
unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of these products or services or any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
moreover  we cannot be sure that any of these products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret law and trademark law 
we have registered some marks and filed trademark applications for other marks with the united states patent and trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also registered copyrights with the state copyright bureau in china with respect to internet related software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states  which does not require registration for protection of copyrights 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited  and the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to control the ultimate destination of our products 
we do not own any patents and have not filed any patent applications  as we do not believe that the benefits of patent protection outweigh the costs of filing and updating patents for our software products 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future as we introduce services that require new technology 
there can be no assurance that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which could be substantial 
investors may not be able to enforce judgments by united states courts against us 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors  executive officers and principal shareholders live outside the united states  principally in beijing and hong kong 
as a result  you may not be able to 
effect service of process upon us or these persons within the united states  or 
enforce against us or these persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert these payments from renminbi  the currency of china  into foreign currencies 
in addition  loan agreements and contractual arrangements we enter into in the future may also restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between these two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between these currencies 
because of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
we report our financial results in us dollars  therefore  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the software and services component of our business and software business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value in our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of the renminbi could reduce the us dollar value of earnings from  and our investments in  our subsidiaries in china 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for telecommunications and internet infrastructure solutions in china is new and rapidly changing 
our competitors in the network infrastructure solutions market mainly include domestic systems integrators such as zoom networks and openet information technology shenzhen corporation 
although we are a leading player in this market  there are many large multinational companies with substantial  existing information technology operations in other markets in china  that have significantly greater financial  technological  marketing and human resources 
should they decide to enter the network infrastructure solutions market  this could hurt our profitability and erode our market share 
in the operation support system solutions market  we compete with both international and local software and solutions providers 
in the online billing segment  we compete primarily with portal software  mind cti ltd 
and zoom networks  and in the wireless billing segment  we compete with more than ten local competitors 
currently  due in part to a stringent approval system for providers of wireless billing software in china and competitive pricing offered by domestic companies  some multinational information technology companies have been deterred from entering this market 
in view of the gradual deregulation of the chinese telecommunications industry and china s entry into the wto  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors into the operation support system solutions market 
the service application solutions sector is highly competitive 
our principal competitor in this sector is openwave systems inc formerly software 
com 
in the network security solutions market  we mainly compete with information security one limited  nsfocus information technology co  ltd  and vianet china inc an increasing number of companies are devoting their resources to this sector in developing network security products 
through mergers and acquisitions  many information technology companies are entering the network security solutions market as part of their strategy of providing a full range of system integration services 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than us  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the people s republic of china in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the ministry of information industry  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and investment in the internet and the telecommunications industry in china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
there is no guarantee that the chinese government will not impose other economic or regulatory controls that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
uncertainties with respect to the chinese legal system could adversely affect us 
our principal operating subsidiary  asiainfo technologies  is a wholly foreign owned enterprise for chinese legal purposes  which means that it is incorporated in china and wholly owned by foreign investors 
asiainfo technologies  along with certain of our other subsidiaries  are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in china in general and laws applicable to wholly foreign owned enterprises in particular 
legislation and regulations over the past years have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in china 
however  since the chinese legal system is still evolving  the interpretations of many laws  regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws  regulations and rules involve uncertainties  which may limit remedies available to us 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to 
investor perceptions of us and investments relating to china and asia  
developments in the internet and telecommunications industries  
variations in our operating results from period to period due to project timing  and 
announcements of new products or services by us or by our competitors 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past  and we have recently become the subject of this type of litigation 
for more information on this litigation  see the discussion above under the heading item legal proceedings 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
future sales of shares by our company or existing shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
a small number of shareholders controls us 
our five largest shareholders  warburg pincus ventures  chinavest group  and their affiliates  as well as edward tian  james ding  our president and chief executive officer  and louis lau  our chairman  control over of our voting stock 
as a result  these shareholders collectively are able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a sale of our assets and the terms of future equity financings 
the combined voting power of our large shareholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control of asiainfo and prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of our common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board of directors to be not less than three nor more than nine directors 
the terms of the office of the eight member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on april  this classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our cash  short term investments and short term bank loans 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes  nor do we speculate in foreign currency 
however  we do maintain a significant portion of our cash deposits in us dollars to avoid currency risk related to renminbi 
a portion of these us dollar deposits are used to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
because substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service component of our network solutions business and software business are denominated in renminbi  we do not have significant exposure to either the us dollar or renminbi 
thus  we do not believe that it is necessary to enter into derivatives contracts to hedge our exposures to either currency 
there have been no significant changes in our exposure to changes in either interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  our exposure to interest rates is limited as we do not have variable rate and long term borrowings 
we are subject to variable interest rates on our bank deposits that are cash and short term investments 
as there are no significant market price movements  such investments are held at cost 
as of december   a hypothetical immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and income by approximately  and  respectively
