item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors 
a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  
the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and 
the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time 
in  we generated of our revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual radio station s local sales staff 
we generated of our revenues from national advertising in  which is purchased through independent  national advertising sales representatives by customers that want to advertise nationwide 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from promotional events and sales to broadcasting networks that purchase commercial airtime 
our operations are divided into three reportable segments  radio group one  radio group two  and radio group three 
the total assets  net revenues  broadcast cash flow and other financial information for these segments is contained in the notes to our financial statements included in item of this report 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase listenership and arbitron ratings 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly in most of our markets  any increased ratings  and therefore increased advertising revenues  tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our inventory  we minimize our use of trade agreements and during the five years prior to have held barter revenues under of our gross revenues and barter related broadcast cash flow under of our broadcast cash flow 
however  barter revenues increased as a percentage of our gross revenues and barter related broadcast cash flow increased as a percentage of our broadcast cash flow in fiscal and due to our investments in etour  inc and findwhat 
com 
as of december   we have completed our barter agreements with etour  inc and findwhat 
com 
we calculate same station results by comparing the performance of radio stations at the end of a relevant period to the performance of those same stations in the prior year s corresponding period  including the effect of barter revenues and expenses 
these results exclude six stations that were acquired during the first quarter of  two stations that were acquired during the second quarter of  and the results from november  to october  for one station that changed formats during the fourth quarter of broadcast cash flow consists of operating income loss before corporate general and administrative expenses  equity appreciation rights  format change expenses  employee and contract termination expenses  depreciation and amortization and impairment loss on long lived assets and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
same station broadcast cash flow is the broadcast cash flow of the radio stations included in our same station calculations 
for purposes of the following discussion  pro forma net income represents historical income before income taxes adjusted as if we were treated as a subchapter c corporation during all relevant periods at an effective tax rate of  applied to income before income taxes 
results of operations as of february   we acquired three fm radio stations in the las vegas market and two fm and one am radio stations in the new orleans market for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  plus a working capital adjustment of approximately million 
this acquisition contributed to higher net revenues and station operating expenses during on april   we acquired two fm radio stations in the augusta  georgia market for approximately million 
this acquisition contributed to higher net revenues and station operating expenses during on may   we received a letter from the management of etour  inc stating that etour  inc is in the process of winding down 
based on this information  we stopped placement of any further advertising air time for etour  inc and recorded a loss on investment of approximately million  the recorded cost of the  shares earned as of may  on october   we entered into a definitive agreement with wilks broadcasting llc to sell wrno fm and kmez fm in the new orleans market for approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
in connection with the definitive agreement  we entered into a time brokerage agreement  which allowed wilks broadcasting to operate wrno fm and kmez fm  beginning november  in exchange for a monthly fee and reimbursement of certain expenses 
on october   the carrying amount of wrno fm and kmez fm exceeded the sales price  therefore we recorded an impairment loss on long lived assets of million during the third quarter of in connection with the pending sale of wrno fm and kmez fm  we recorded employee and contract termination expenses of approximately million during the fourth quarter of on march   we terminated the time brokerage agreement and completed the sale of wrno fm and kmez fm to wilks broadcasting llc 
as consideration for the sale of these two stations we received million  subject to certain adjustments  including million in cash and million in the form of a note payable from wilks broadcasting llc 
the note accrues interest at per annum and the principal amount and all accrued interest are due on june  we used million of the net cash proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding term loan under our credit facility 
in  we entered into contracts for the radio broadcast rights relating to the miami dolphins  florida marlins and florida panthers sports franchises 
these contracts grant wqam am the exclusive  english language rights for live radio broadcasts of the sporting events of these franchises for a five year term which began in the contracts require us to pay fees and to provide commercial advertising and other considerations 
as of december   remaining payments of fees are as follows  in for the years ended december   and  the contract expense calculated on a straight line basis and other direct expenses exceeded related revenues by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during  we experienced a softer advertising environment due to slowing economic conditions 
in response to the reduction in net revenues we took significant steps to cut costs not vital to programming and sales and we continued consolidation of our operations 
in connection with this response  we recorded employee and contract termination expenses of approximately million during the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to our radio station acquisitions in the las vegas and new orleans markets during the first quarter of  in the augusta  georgia market during the second quarter of and the inclusion of net revenue for an entire year from our radio station acquisitions in the miami ft

other operating contracts include contracts for sports programming rights  on air personalities  and rating services 
other commercial commitments as of december   we had four interest rate collar agreements outstanding which currently require us to make interest payments based on the floor rate of interest and notional amount as stated in the collar agreements 
as of december   the notional amount upon maturity of these collar agreements was million 
due to the decline in interest rates during  the estimated fair value of these collar agreements decreased and we recorded a million liability for derivative financial instruments as of december  the estimated fair value of each interest rate collar agreement is based on the amounts we would expect to pay to terminate the agreement 
these amounts could become due and payable prior to the expiration of the agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions we consider reasonable at the time of making those estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or using different assumptions 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inpairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required 
we have recorded certain deferred tax assets  which we consider fully realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities that are anticipated to reverse during similar future periods 
accordingly  we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
if we were to determine that we would be unable to fully realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be recorded as an expense in the period such determination was made 
we have significant amounts of property and equipment and intangibles  including fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill  recorded in our financial statements 
we assess the recoverability of our property and equipment and intangibles on an on going basis using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows that we expect to generate from these assets 
our radio stations operate in competitive markets and as such could experience adverse changes in listenership and cash flows 
these adverse changes may result in an impairment of our property and equipment and intangibles in the future 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas we adopted the provisions of sfas upon issuance and the provisions of sfas effective january  sfas requires that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill and to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
as of the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million  and unamortized fcc broadcasting licenses  which we expect to qualify as identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  in the amount of approximately million  all of which were subject to the transition provisions of sfas and sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to fcc broadcasting licenses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas and sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long live assets 
sfas supersedes sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
sfas also amends portions of arb no 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not completed our evaluation of sfas  however  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our earnings or financial position upon adoption 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas amends sfas and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not completed our evaluation of sfas  however  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our earnings or financial position upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility incur interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus additional basis points depending on the outstanding principal balance under the credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest rates in the market place 
to manage interest rate risk associated with our credit agreement  we have entered into several interest rate collar agreements 
an interest rate collar is the combined purchase and sale of an interest rate cap and an interest rate floor so as to keep interest rate exposure within a defined range 
we have purchased four interest rate collars 
under these agreements  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate and our base libor cannot fall below our floor interest rate 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
as of december   the notional amount upon maturity of these collar agreements is million 
as of december   our collar agreements are summarized in the following chart estimated notional expiration fair agreement amount floor cap date value interest rate collar  may  interest rate collar  november  interest rate collar  november  interest rate collar  october
