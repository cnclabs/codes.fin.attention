item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
introduction our net broadcast revenue is derived primarily from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  tower rental income  ticket and other revenue related to special events we sponsor throughout the year 
our net broadcast revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
advertising rates are based primarily on 
a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by arbitron  
the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and 
the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
in  approximately of our net revenue was generated from local advertising and was generated from national spot advertising  including network advertising 
the balance of revenue was generated primarily from tower rental income  ticket and other revenue related to our sponsored events 
our significant broadcast expenses are i employee salaries and commissions  ii programming expenses  iii advertising and promotion expenses  iv rental of premises for studios  v rental of transmission tower space and vi music license royalty fees 
we strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems and the overall programming management function 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase our audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore the effect on advertising revenues tends to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures 
depreciation and amortization of costs associated with the acquisition of radio stations and interest carrying charges have historically been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
however  with the adoption of sfas and sfas  the impact of depreciation and amortization is expected to be greatly reduced in and future periods see liquidity recent accounting pronouncements below 
the performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net broadcast revenue  broadcast cash flow and ebitda  although broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not measures utilized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap see selected financial data non gaap measures 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda should not be considered in isolation from  nor as substitutes for  operating income  net income  cash flow  or other consolidated income or cash flow statement data computed in accordance with gaap  nor as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
despite their limitations  broadcast cash flow and ebitda are widely used in the broadcasting industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  particularly in the case of acquisitions 
by eliminating such effects  broadcast cash flow provides a meaningful measure of comparative radio station performance  and ebitda provides a meaningful measure of overall company performance after taking into account corporate operating expenses related to the employment of the senior management team and other overhead costs 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our spot inventory  we minimize the use of trade agreements and have reduced trade revenue to approximately of our gross revenue in  down from approximately in we calculate same station growth over a particular period by comparing performance of stations owned and or operated under a local marketing agreement during the current period with the performance of the same stations for the corresponding period in the prior year 
however  no station will be included in such a comparison unless it has been owned and or operated under a local marketing agreement for at least one month of every quarter included in each of the current and corresponding prior year periods

we anticipate that any future acquisitions and strategic investments will be financed through funds generated from operations  equity financings  permitted debt financings  debt financings through unrestricted subsidiaries or a combination of these sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if available  will be available on favorable terms 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt  and our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in  will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
in addition to debt service and the dividends related to our preferred stock  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital  continued business development  strategic investment opportunities and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
for  capital expenditures are expected to total approximately to million 
management believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  for the foreseeable future  cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to make required payments of interest on our indebtedness  to fund our pending acquisition  to pay dividends on our preferred stock  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to enable us to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
however  in order to finance future acquisitions or investments  if any  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  which is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  this pronouncement requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against this new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
we adopted this statement on july  also  in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement requires a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations but  instead  would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than their fair value 
we adopted the provisions of this statement  which apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june   on january  we adopted the provisions of this statement  which apply to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets acquired after june   on july  as a result of our adoption of sfas  we did not record amortization expense related to the blue chip broadcasting  inc acquisition 
amortization expense would have approximated million related to the goodwill and fcc licenses had we not adopted this non amortization approach 
the adoption of these accounting standards will eliminate the amortization of goodwill and fcc broadcast licenses commencing january  sfas will have a material impact on radio one s financial statements  as the amounts previously recorded for the amortization of goodwill and fcc broadcast licenses is significant 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization expense for goodwill of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization expense for fcc broadcast licenses of million  million and million  respectively 
we expect amortization expense to decrease by approximately million annually as a result of this pronouncement 
in august  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  and abp opinion no 
this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas that require radio one to test long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows  however  the statement eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to these long lived assets 
the statement also requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by a sale must be recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less the cost to sell the asset  and depreciation should cease to be recorded on such assets 
any loss resulting from the write down of the assets shall be recognized in income from continuing operations 
additionally  long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale may no longer be classified as discontinued until they are disposed of 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  radio one will apply this guidance prospectively
