overview the company is in the business of providing rapid and accurate technolog y deployment services and licensing software tools to support technology provider s and enterprises in the delivery of complex it solutions 
utilizing two regional staging and configuration centers and its own field deployment team o f approximately people operating out of offices  the company conduct s multiple simultaneous large scale deployments for organizations throughout th e united states and canada 
the company believes its consistent  rapid deploymen t model enables its enterprise customers to accelerate the assimilation o f networking technologies into their organizations and allows its technolog y providers to enhance the absorption of their products in the marketplace 
the company began utilizing software tools as the main driver of it s configuration and integration services when it acquired computer aided softwar e integration  inc casi in this acquisition brought with it iw  a suite of software tools used in the configuration and integration processes during fiscal the company began expanding its development of software tool s to incorporate several new applications in addition to iw and ha s incorporated them into a new product  edeploy tm 
these applications include preparation and design  configuration and integration  deployment management an d transition and maintenance 
during that year the company brought the activitie s of developing  marketing  selling and managing the licensing of its softwar e into its casi subsidiary 
the company then changed the name of casi t o edeploy

critical accounting policies the company s deployment services are generally provided at a fixed contrac t price pursuant to purchase orders or other agreements with its customers  whil e its software licensing is done on a per seat basis over a specified period o f time and its application service provider asp activities are based on usage services from deployment activities are performed primarily under long ter m contracts  but may be performed under short term workorders or time and materia l arrangements 
the company s typical long term contract contains multipl e elements designed to track the various services required under the arrangemen t with the customer 
these elements are used to identify components of progres s billings  but are combined for revenue recognition purposes 
the compan y recognizes revenue earned under long term contracts utilizing the percentage o f completion method of accounting by measuring direct labor costs incurred t o total estimated labor costs 
under the percentage of completion method o f accounting  revenue  costs and gross margin are recognized as work is performe d based on the relationship between direct labor incurred and total estimate d labor 
contracts are reviewed at least quarterly and if necessary  revenue  costs an d gross margin are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated tota l contract value and total estimated contract costs 
estimated losses ar e recognized when identified 
payment milestones differ according to the customer and the type of wor k performed 
generally  the company invoices customers and payments are receive d throughout the deployment process and  in certain cases  in advance of wor k performed if a substantial amount of up front costs is required 
in certai n cases payments are received from customers after the completion of sit e installation 
however  revenue and costs are only recognized on long ter m contracts to the extent of the contracts percentage of completion 
unbille d revenue  which is classified as a current asset  is recorded for the amount o f revenue earned in excess of billings to customers 
deferred revenue is recorde d as a current liability for the amount of billings in excess of revenue earned costs incurred in excess of percentage of completion are deferred and classifie d as a current asset  while accrued costs are classified as current liabilities 
the company s cost of deployment services consists of four main categories labor  materials  project expenses and allocated indirect costs 
the compan y estimates progress toward completion of its contracts by applying the percentag e of direct labor incurred to total estimated direct labor 
direct costs labor materials  and project expenses are charged directly to projects as they ar e incurred 
indirect costs are then applied to projects and a gross margin i s determined 
this enables management to track all costs associated wit h delivering services to its customers 
project managers and other fiel d supervisors manage and are evaluated  in part  on how projects actual direc t costs compare to their estimated direct costs 
operations management manages an d is evaluated  in part  on how projects actual gross margins compare to targete d gross margins 
labor consists of salaries and benefits of the company s field installatio n force as well as staging and configuration personnel 
the materials categor y includes all materials used in the installation process such as connectors  wal l plates  conduits  and data and electrical cable 
project expenses include trave l and living expenses for the installation teams  equipment rentals and othe r costs that are not labor or materials costs 
in addition  indirect costs  suc h as software amortization  warehouse expense  material handling costs  etc  ar e allocated to projects on bases that reflect management s estimate of absorption of these costs by each project generally direct labor hours 
the company capitalizes certain computer software costs incurred in accordanc e with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for th e costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
also  th e company capitalizes certain costs of computer software developed or obtained fo r internal use in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting fo r the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
onc e technological feasibility has been established  software development costs ar e captured in the company s job costing system under specific projects related t o the development effort 
costs related to software developed for external use ar e amortized using the greater of the ratio that current gross revenue for a product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues fo r the product  or a maximum of three years using the straight line metho d beginning when the products are available for general release to customers costs related to internal use software are amortized over a period not to excee d three years 
as of april   the company had net operating loss carryforwards fo r federal tax purposes of approximately million 
united states tax rules limi t the amount of net operating loss that companies may utilize in any one year i n the event of a shareholder having cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
the company does not believe that i t incurred a change of ownership that limits its ability to utilize its ne t operating loss carryforwards as of april   although ownership changes i n future periods may pose limitations on the company s use of net operating los s carry forwards 
during fiscal and  the company determined that it wa s unlikely that it would realize net operating loss carry forwards  and as such has provided a valuation allowance offsetting these carryforwards 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principle s generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimate s and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities an d disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financia l statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during th e reporting period 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidate d financial statements include estimated revenues under long term contracts estimated costs to complete long term contracts  recoverability of intangible s and other long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts and inventor y carrying values 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company elected to early adopt the provisions of sfas goodwill an d other intangible assets 
see note 
these provisions require that goodwil l no longer be subject to amortization but rather be reviewed periodically fo r impairment and that other identifiable intangibles be separated and those wit h finite lives be amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and intangibl e assets with indefinite lives must be assessed once a year for impairment  an d more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
based on it s evaluation  which  in part  was based on certain fair value assumptions  th e company determined that there is no impairment to its goodwill and othe r intangible assets 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with th e company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearin g elsewhere herein

its direct sales are mainly t o fortune customers which have significant numbers of geographicall y dispersed sites and where the technology being implemented is complex 
as such retail  insurance  hospitality and financial services are datatec s targe t market segments 
these market segments are highly challenging for most smal l sized integrators  but datatec s software tools  processes and nationa l operations allow it to operate successfully within these segments 
when datate c adopted an indirect model in by selling its service offerings throug h technology partners to their clients that fall within datatec s target marke t segments  datatec decided to reduce channel conflict by adopting a preservation strategy with its direct accounts and opted to grow it s operations primarily through its indirect channel 
therefore the revenue growt h within each market segment was not dependent upon the segment s relativ e economic environment  but was the result of the new strategy adopted by datatec revenue revenue for the year ended april  was million compared t o million for the year ended april   representing a decrease o f approximately 
deployment services revenue decreased to million i n fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of  while softwar e licensing revenue increased to million from million for the sam e period 
the decrease in revenue was attributed to the continued slowdown i n technology deployment across industries through the quarter ended january  which delayed business decisions until the company s fourth fisca l quarter 
revenue from technology providers decreased  going from million in to million in  as these companies were severel y impacted by the slowdown in technology spending 
revenue from enterpris e customers increased by million  going from million in to million in fiscal  as the slowdown in technology spending had less of a n impact on the retailing sector than on other sectors

the increase i n gross margin was primarily due to an approximate reduction in indirec t salary costs during fiscal year  a more efficient delivery of services an d lower materials costs 
these were partially offset by a decrease in revenue fo r the year ended april  from april  of approximately million 
labor costs as a percent of revenue for the years ended april  and were approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in direct labo r during fiscal was the result of personnel cutbacks started during fisca l caused by lower revenue 
materials costs as a percentage of revenue ove r the same periods were approximately and  respectively 
the decrease i n materials costs was directly related to the decrease in overall revenue 
projec t expense costs as a percentage of revenue over the same periods wer e approximately for both years 
these costs remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenue generated as the overall components of a typica l deployment contract remained unchanged 
occasionally  the materials component o f a contract may vary depending upon the deployment requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general an d administrative expenses for the years ended april  and were million and million respectively  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses represente d of revenue for the year ended april  compared to for the yea r ended april  the decrease in selling  general and administrativ e expenses was due to cost savings programs  primarily personnel reductions initiated during the fiscal year ended april  but fully realized in th e current year 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended april  was million  including  interest accreted in connection with the subordinate d secured convertible debentures and warrants  compared to million for th e year ended april  the increase is attributable to higher averag e borrowings and borrowing costs 
comparison of fiscal years ended april  and revenue revenue for the year ended april  was million compared t o million for the year ended april   representing an increase o f approximately 
deployment services revenue increased to million i n fiscal from million in fiscal  while software licensing revenu e increased to million from million for the same period 
the decrease i n revenue was attributed to the slowdown in technology deployment acros s industries 
revenue from technology providers more than doubled  going fro m million in to million in  as the company s focus on thi s segment began to show results 
revenue from enterprise customers decreased going from million in to million in fiscal  as the compan y changed its marketing focus towards technology providers

the decrease in gross margin wa s primarily due to higher labor costs  a more significant materials cost componen t and an approximate increase in indirect salary costs during fiscal yea r labor costs as a percent of revenue for the years ended april  and were approximately and  respectively 
the increase in direct labor wa s the result of hiring additional labor in anticipation of additional volume an d not reacting quickly enough to the dramatic reduction in orders that occurre d during the second half of fiscal materials costs as a percentage o f revenue over the same period were approximately and  respectively during fiscal the materials component of revenue was similar to that o f fiscal  but the company greatly reduced its margin on materials revenues i n response to a strong competitive environment 
project expense costs as a percentage of revenue over the same period were approximately and respectively

as a percentage of revenues  selling  general an d administrative expenses represented for the year ended april  compared to for the year ended april  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased salary benefits and payroll taxes associated with higher headcount levels in the fisca l quarters ended july and october  interest expense

backlog consist s of purchase orders and written agreements with customers for which a custome r has scheduled the provision of services within the next months 
order s included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without penalty a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generall y affecting the customer s industry  may cause customers to cancel  reduce o r delay orders that were previously made or anticipated 
the company cannot assur e the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced orders 
significant o r numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group o f customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business financial condition and results of operations 
backlog should not be relied upo n as indicative of the company s revenues for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources changes in major balance sheet classifications current assets current assets as of april  and amounted t o approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease o f approximately million is the result of lower revenue generated during the year ended april   causing a decrease in accounts receivable and cash  and a requirement for lower inventor y levels 
property and equipment property and equipment as of april  and amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
th e decrease of approximately million reflects a decrease in capita l expenditures as the company adjusted its spending levels to reflect curren t business activity 
other assets other assets as of april  and amounted t o approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease o f approximately million reflects the decrease in the investment in softwar e development as the company adjusted its spending levels to reflect curren t business activity 
current liabilities current liabilities as of april  and amounte d to approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease o f approximately million is attributable to the decrease in activity durin g fiscal and the use of proceeds from the sale of subordinated secure d convertible debentures to pay down current obligations 
this decrease wa s partially offset by an increase in the company s short term borrowings 
minority interest as previously described  minority interest was eliminate d during the year ended april  due to the conversion of cisco s investmen t in edeploy 
com  inc into common stock of the company 
cash flow cash used in operating activities decreased to million for th e fiscal year ended april  from million for the fiscal year ende d april  primarily as a result of aggressive cost cutting initiated durin g fiscal  but more fully realized during the year ended april  a decrease in inventory  resulting from the decrease in revenue and mor e aggressive cash management contributed to the cash flow from operations 
cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million t o million for the year ended april  from million for the yea r ended april  the decrease was the result of the cost reduction progra m by the company initiated during fiscal and carried through to fiscal and of a reduction in the investment in software development during fiscal as the development of the company s edeploy tm solution was substantiall y completed in the prior year 
cash provided from financing activities increased by approximately million for the year ended april  to million from million fo r the year ended april  cash was generated primarily from the sale o f subordinated secured convertible debentures million  net and short ter m borrowings million for the fiscal year ended april   while cas h generated during the year ended april  primarily arose from short ter m borrowings million and the sale of common stock million  offse t by the repayment of debt of approximately million 
liquidity the net loss of million incurred during the fiscal year ended april resulted in a strain on the company s cash resources and the net loss o f million for the fiscal year ended april  added to this strain although the company took dramatic measures to cut costs  the company s workin g capital line has been close to its maximum allowable levels and the average day s outstanding of its trade payables have extended beyond normal credit term s granted by vendors 
the loss for the fiscal year ended april  wa s substantially less than the prior year s loss and the company s operating pla n for the fiscal year ending april  projects profitable results 
however the company continues to experience tight liquidity and extended day s outstanding of its trade payables 
it is aggressively managing its cash as i t works to return to profitability 
furthermore  ibm credit corp  the company s working capital lender  has notified the company that it does not intend t o renew its working capital line and term loan beyond august  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company is activel y seeking replacement financing 
achievement of its fiscal operating plan depends upon the timing of wor k performed by the company on existing projects  the ability of the company t o gain and perform work on new projects  the ability of the company to maintai n positive relations with its key vendors and the ability of the company t o replace its current working capital financing line 
multiple projec t cancellations  delays in the timing of work performed by the company on existin g projects  the inability of the company to gain and perform work on new projects or the inability of the company to replace its current working capital financin g line could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and on its abilit y to execute its operating plan 
the company has taken action to ensure its continuation as a going concern 
a summary of recent events and the company s completed or planned actions follow demand for the company s services has increased dramatically and th e backlog of contracted business as of august  was at a record million 
the company initiated and completed substantial cost saving measures durin g the fiscal years ended april  and and now has a cost structur e in line with its expected revenue 
as a result of the increase in demand for the company s services and th e cost reduction measures initiated over the past two years  the compan y achieved profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal and expect s to maintain profitability throughout fiscal management has been seeking to replace its working capital line and rais e additional capital to support its growth in business 
it is encouraged b y the preliminary response it has received from the financial community an d it expects to raise the necessary financing 
the company was not in compliance with one or more of the financial covenants o f its credit facility as of the quarters ended january  and april  of fiscal and as of each quarter end of fiscal the company and ib m credit corporation entered into an acknowledgment  waiver and amendment to th e inventory and working capital financing agreement as of the end of each quarter the following is a summary of the covenant violations for each quarter period covenant requirement ac tual jan net profit to revenue equal to or greater than net loss apr annual revenue to greater than and equal to or working capital less than to
