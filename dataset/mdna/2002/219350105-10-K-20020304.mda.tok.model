item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  appearing on pages through  and note information by operating segment to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through competition corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers  both domestic and foreign 
some of these competitors are larger than corning  and some have broader product lines 
competition within the telecommunications industry is intense among several significant companies 
corning represents an important market presence in the segment s principal product lines 
price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors 
the current downturn in the telecommunications industry may change the competitive landscape in the future 
within the advanced materials segment  corning s principal products face competition from a variety of materials manufacturers  some of which manufacture similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics 
among other things  innovation  product quality  performance and service are key competitive elements 
competition is also intense for certain businesses within the information display segment as new entrants may be able to offer lower prices 
corning strives to maintain its market position through technology and product innovation 
for the future  corning s competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development  its financial resources and its commitment to quality 
there is no assurance that corning will be able to maintain its market position or competitive advantage 
raw materials corning s production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials 
although energy shortages have not been a problem recently  corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the lowest cost energy source in most significant processes 
specifically  corning s principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas  propane  oil or electricity  or a combination of these energy sources 
as to resources ores  minerals  and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations  availability appears to be adequate 
corning s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations  or may eliminate certain product lines  nevertheless  corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials 
for many products  corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 
certain key optical components used in the manufacturing of products within corning s telecommunications segment are currently available only from a limited number of sources 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  or reduce corning s gross margins 
patents and trademarks inventions by members of corning s research and engineering staff have been  and continue to be  important to the company s growth 
patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries 
some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers  including corning s associated companies 
many of the earlier patents have now expired 
most of corning s products are marketed under the following trademarks corning  celcor  costar  fibergain  hpfs  leaf  metrocor  purepath  pyrex  steuben and vycor 
subsidiaries and divisions of corning frequently use their own trademarks 
protection of the environment corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state  federal and foreign pollution control regulations 
this program resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years 
in order to maintain compliance with such regulations  capital expenditures for pollution control in continuing operations were approximately million in and are estimated to be million in corning s operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately million for depreciation  maintenance  waste disposal and other operating expenses associated with pollution control 
corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage 
risk factors the following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report  in corning s filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers substantially reduced orders for our products our customer base is relatively concentrated  and a modest number of customers account for a high percentage of net sales in our telecommunications  environmental products and information display product businesses 
if we are unable to establish or maintain good relationships with key customers  it could negatively affect our results of operations and financial performance 
some of our major customers have reduced  modified  cancelled or rescheduled orders for our products and have expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements 
as a result  our sales have declined and it is difficult to predict future sales accurately 
the conditions contributing to this difficulty include uncertainty regarding the capital spending plans of the major telecommunications carriers  upon whom our customers and  ultimately we  depend for sales  the telecommunications carriers current limited access to the capital required for expansion  and general market and economic uncertainty 
the current economic downturn may be more severe and prolonged than expected 
if our net sales continue to decline  our ability to return to profitability and improve free cash flow for future periods may be impeded 
if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes  or achieve manufacturing yields  or sufficient product reliability  our operating results could suffer in the current economic downturn  we have responded to the softer market by cutting costs  including the reduction of our manufacturing volumes 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we approved and began executing formal plans to close seven major manufacturing facilities and downsize our workforce by approximately  positions 
we cannot assure you that we have mitigated the adverse effects of a softer market  nor can we assure you that additional adjustments will not be necessary to respond to further market changes 
the manufacture of our products involves highly complex and precise processes  requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments 
changes in our manufacturing processes  or those of our suppliers could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability 
in some cases  existing manufacturing techniques  which involve substantial manual labor  may be insufficient to achieve the volume  or cost targets of our customers 
we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume and cost levels 
while we continue to devote substantial efforts to the improvement of our manufacturing techniques and processes  we may not achieve cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our customers 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  restructuring  inventory related and other charges  the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately as a result of the business downturn  we approved and began executing formal plans to close seven major manufacturing facilities and downsize our workforce by approximately  positions 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a total charge of million million after tax which included a restructuring charge of million and a charge to impair plant and equipment of million 
we also recorded pre tax charges totaling million for the write down of excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters of our ability to forecast our customers needs for our products in the current economic environment is very limited 
accordingly  additional charges for restructuring  inventory adjustments  or write downs and other charges may be required if the business downturn is more severe than we currently anticipate 
if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate  demand for our products may decline  which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our success is expected to depend  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products  upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards  our ability to acquire technologies needed to remain competitive and our ability to address competing technologies and products 
in addition  the following factors related to our products and the markets for them could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial performance if we are unable to introduce optical fiber  or any other leading products such as our glass for flat panel displays that can command competitive prices in the marketplace  if we are unable to achieve  or maintain a favorable mix of products  including a mix of sales between premium and non premium products  a decline in demand  or an unanticipated change in market demand for specific products  if we are unable to continue to develop new product lines to address our customers diverse needs within the several market segments in which we participate 
this requires a high level of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends  or if we are not successful in creating the infrastructure required to support anticipated growth in product demand 
we face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance we are currently facing pricing pressures in several of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition  emerging new technologies and excess manufacturing capacity in both the domestic and the international marketplaces 
while we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to pricing pressures  we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs 
as a result of potential overcapacity and the current economic downturn  pricing pressures may increase in the foreseeable future 
we have incurred and may in the future incur  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges acquisitions recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have resulted  and in the future may result  in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the amortization and impairment of these assets through and potential impairment of these assets thereafter has significantly reduced and could further reduce our net income 
during the first half of  we experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of our telecommunications segment  primarily in the photonic technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry 
during the second quarter  major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and cancelled orders already placed 
management determined that the growth prospects of this business were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods 
as a result  we determined that the long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of optical technologies usa from pirelli and cisco systems and our acquisition of netoptix corporation  were not recoverable 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately billion to impair a significant portion of the goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with these acquisitions 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
pursuant to which goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
sfas no 
was effective for us on january  an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption must be performed within one year 
we do not anticipate a transitional impairment charge from the adoption of the standard  however  future changes in the expected performance of our businesses could cause us to take further impairment charges 
at december   corning had billion in goodwill 
we may be limited in our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms although we believe existing cash  short term investments  operating cash flows  access to capital markets and borrowing capacity  collectively  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures relating to the expansion of existing businesses and acquisitions  we may be required to seek additional financing to compete effectively in these markets 
our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise debt and the cost of such debt 
in february  fitch downgraded our long term rating from bbb to bbb with a negative outlook 
in november  standard poor s downgraded our corporate rating from a to bbb and maintained a negative outlook  while removing us from creditwatch with negative implications  and moody s reduced our senior debt rating from a to baa with a negative outlook 
these and any further downgrades could increase borrowing costs and affect our ability to access the debt capital markets  including the commercial paper market  on a consistent basis 
the pricing of our common stock may limit our ability to access the equity capital markets on terms and in amounts that would be satisfactory to us 
difficulties we may encounter in managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations we have historically achieved growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to continue developing or acquiring new products for our customer base 
we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies as well as equity ventures to develop new technologies and product lines  although we cannot guarantee that we will be successful  or that we will have cash or equity sufficient to complete strategic acquisitions 
the success of each acquisition will depend  in part  upon our ability to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our organization  to manufacture and sell the products of the businesses acquired at satisfactory prices and gross margins  to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  to apply our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to the acquired businesses  and to successfully complete technology initiatives 
if our products or components purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues  our business will suffer our business depends on our producing excellent products of consistently high quality 
to this end  our products  including components purchased from our suppliers  are rigorously tested for quality both by us and our customers 
nevertheless  our products are highly complex and our customers testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios 
for various reasons including  among others  the occurrence of performance problems unforeseeable in testing  our products and components purchased from our suppliers may fail to perform as expected 
performance issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing 
we have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues 
in some cases  product redesigns or additional capital equipment may be required to correct a defect 
in addition  any significant or systemic product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products  as well as result in customer relations problems 
interruptions of supplies from our key suppliers may affect our results of operations and financial performance interruptions of supplies from our key suppliers could disrupt production  or impact our ability to increase production and sales 
we obtain several critical components used in the production of telecommunications products from a limited number of suppliers  some of which are also our competitors 
we do not have long term or volume purchase agreements with every supplier  and may have limited options for alternative supply if these suppliers fail to continue the supply of components 
we face intense competition in several of our businesses we face intense competition in several of our businesses 
we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and from a number of companies that may enter our markets 
since some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid growth and rapid technology changes  smaller niche and start up companies may become our principal competitors in the future 
we must invest in research and development  expand our engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive 
while we expect to undertake the investment and effort in each of these areas  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position 
our competitors may have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing or other support resources 
market consolidation may also create additional or stronger competitors and may intensify competition 
we may experience difficulties in obtaining or protecting intellectual property rights we may encounter difficulties  costs or risks in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our businesses 
other companies  including some of our large competitors  hold patents in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand their patent portfolios 
the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products in our field of operations unless we secure licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
we are  and may in the future be  subject to claims of intellectual property infringement from time to time and we cannot assure you as to the outcome of such claims 
we face risks related to our international operations and sales we have customers located outside the united states  as well as significant foreign operations  including manufacturing and sales 
as a result of these international operations  we face a number of risks  including the difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations  change in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in foreign markets  and fluctuations in foreign currencies which may make our products less competitive in countries in which local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar 
if we fail to attract and retain key personnel  our results of operations and financial performance may suffer our future success will be determined in part by our ability to attract and retain  in the current business environment  key scientific and technical personnel for our research  development and engineering efforts 
our business also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
a key to attracting and retaining qualified employees is our ability to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in the potential growth of our business through such programs as stock option plans and employee investment plans  the value of which may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of the payment of dividends on our common stock  negative stock price performance or stock price volatility 
we may also find it more difficult to attract or retain qualified employees due to our recent reductions in the workforce 
while we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in the future 
if we provide customer financing in the future  it could expose us to the term credit quality of our customers we currently do not provide customer financing 
however  the competitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide medium term and long term customer financing in the future 
if we do so  we will be exposed to the term credit quality of our customers 
in the event of economic uncertainty  or reduced demand for customer financings in the capital and bank markets  we may be required to continue to hold some customer financing obligations for longer periods prior to placement with third party lenders 
acts of terrorism or war and any military or economic response by the united states may harm our financial condition or results of operations our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism  military or economic actions taken in response or to prevent similar acts of terrorism  or any negative impacts on the economy of terrorists acts or military responses 
current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations pending  threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes  expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured 
our quarterly results may fluctuate we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results 
all of the concerns we have discussed under risk factors in this form k could affect our operating results 
in addition  our operating results may be affected by seasonality  the timing of the receipt of product orders from a limited number of major customers  the announcement and introduction of new products by us  expenses associated with litigation  and the costs associated with the acquisition or disposition of a business 
our common stock price has experienced and may continue to experience substantial volatility the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile because of the following factors fluctuations in our quarterly results  announcements by our competitors and customers of technological innovations or new products  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  and general market conditions 
in addition  changes in the market s valuation of telecommunications equipment stocks  and in particular those that participate in supplying optical fiber and photonic products  could cause our common stock to be volatile or decline from current levels 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies  which fluctuation may also cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our results of operations and financial performance in future quarters may not meet the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors  and that could cause significant volatility in the price of our common stock 
other additional information in response to item i is found in note information by operating segment to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through and five years in review historical comparison appearing on pages through item properties corning operates more than manufacturing plants and processing facilities  of which approximately half are located in the united states 
corning owns substantially all of its executive and corporate buildings  which are located in corning  new york 
corning also owns substantially all of its manufacturing and research and development facilities and more than half of its sales and administrative facilities 
during the last five years  corning has invested billion in property  construction  expansion  and modernization for continuing operations 
of the billion spent in  million was spent on facilities outside the united states 
manufacturing  sales and administrative  and research and development facilities at consolidated locations have an aggregate floor space of approximately million square feet 
distribution of this total area is million square feet total domestic foreign manufacturing sales and administrative research and development some facilities manufacture products included in more than one operating segment 
total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in note information by operating segment to the consolidated financial statements 
information concerning lease commitments is included in note commitments  contingencies  guarantees and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through during  corning undertook a restructuring program that closed seven major manufacturing facilities and consolidated certain smaller facilities 
in the opinion of management  corning s facilities are now suitable and adequate for production and distribution of the company s products based upon the level of demand we anticipate in at december   corning was not productively utilizing a significant portion of space in the facilities 
due to the slowdown in the telecommunications industry which lowered the demand for premium fiber products  the company temporarily idled most of its fiber manufacturing facilities and slowed cable manufacturing in the fourth quarter 
item legal proceedings environmental litigation 
corning has been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party at active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
corning has accrued approximately million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at december  based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company s estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
dow corning bankruptcy 
corning and the dow chemical company each own of the common stock of dow corning corporation 
on may   dow corning sought protection under the reorganization provisions of chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and thereby obtained a stay of approximately  breast implant product liability lawsuits 
on november   dow corning and the tort claimants committee jointly filed a revised plan of reorganization joint plan which was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on november  on december   the bankruptcy court issued an opinion that approved the principal elements of the joint plan with respect to tort claimants  but construed the joint plan as providing releases for third parties including corning and dow chemical as shareholders only with respect to tort claimants who voted in favor of the joint plan 
on november   the district court entered an order reversing the bankruptcy court s december   opinion on the release and injunction provisions and confirmed the joint plan 
on october   the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit heard oral arguments on appeals taken by foreign claimants  the us government and certain tort claimants from various portions of the district court s order 
on january   the sixth circuit affirmed the determinations made in the district court with respect to the foreign claimants  but remanded to the district court for further proceedings with respect to the claims of the us government for recovery of medical expenses paid on behalf of tort claimants and with respect to the findings supporting the non debtor releases in favor of dow corning s shareholders and insurers 
as a result of the remand  there may be additional hearings in the district court 
the timing and scope of the proceedings on remand are not known at this point  and the sixth circuit s ruling adds some uncertainty with respect to the ultimate confirmation of the joint plan 
if the joint plan is upheld but the shareholder releases are not given their full effect  corning would expect to defend any remaining claims against it and any new claims on the same grounds that led to a series of orders and judgments dismissing all claims against corning in the federal courts and in many state courts as described under the heading implant tort lawsuits immediately hereafter 
management believes that the claims against corning lack merit and that the breast implant litigation against corning will be resolved without material impact on corning s financial statements 
under the terms of the joint plan  dow corning would be required to establish a settlement trust and a litigation facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims 
dow corning would have the obligation to fund the trust and the facility  over a period of up to years  in an amount up to approximately billion  subject to the limitations  terms and conditions stated in the joint plan 
corning and dow chemical have each agreed to provide a credit facility to dow corning of up to million million in the aggregate  subject to the terms and conditions stated in the joint plan 
the joint plan also provides for dow corning to make full payment  through cash and the issuance of senior notes  to its commercial creditors 
the commercial creditors have contested the bankruptcy court s disallowance of their claims for post petition interest at default rates of interest  and have appealed to the district court 
while the amounts at issue on this appeal are subject to a variety of contingencies  it is possible that the aggregate claim exceeds million 
dow corning is vigorously contesting the appeal 
if and when dow corning emerges from bankruptcy  corning expects to resume the recognition of equity earnings from dow corning 
corning does not expect to receive dividends from dow corning in the foreseeable future 
implant tort lawsuits 
corning and dow chemical  the shareholders of dow corning corporation  were named in a number of state and federal tort lawsuits alleging injuries arising from dow corning s implant products 
the claims against the shareholders alleged a variety of direct or indirect theories of liability 
in  the federal breast implants cases were coordinated for pretrial purposes in the united states district court  northern district of alabama judge sam c 
pointer  jr in april  corning obtained a summary judgment dismissing it from over  federal court cases 
on march   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit dismissed the plaintiffs appeal from that judgment 
in state court legislation  corning was awarded summary judgment in california  connecticut  illinois  indiana  michigan  mississippi  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  tennessee  and dallas  harris and travis counties in texas  thereby dismissing approximately  state cases 
in louisiana  corning was awarded summary judgment dismissing all claims by plaintiffs and a cross claim by dow chemical on february  on february   the intermediate appeals court in louisiana vacated this judgment as premature 
the louisiana cases were transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  southern division michigan federal court to which substantially all breast implant cases were transferred in in the michigan federal court  corning is named as a defendant in approximately pending cases including some cases with multiple claimants  in addition to the transferred louisiana cases 
the michigan federal court heard corning s motion for summary judgment on february   but has not ruled 
based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of complex litigation is uncertain  management believes that the risk of a materially adverse result in the implant litigation against corning is remote and believes the implant litigation against corning will be resolved without material impact on corning s financial statements 
federal securities cases 
a federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in against corning and certain individual defendants by a class of purchasers of corning stock who allege misrepresentations and omissions of material facts relative to the silicone gel breast implant business conducted by dow corning 
this action is pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the class consists of those purchasers of corning stock in the period from june   to january   who allegedly purchased at inflated prices due to the non disclosure or concealment of material information and were damaged when corning s stock price declined in january after the food and drug administration fda requested a moratorium on dow corning s sale of silicone gel implants 
no amount of damages is specified in the complaint 
in  the court dismissed the individual defendants from the case 
in december  corning filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that all claims against it be dismissed 
plaintiffs requested the opportunity to take depositions before responding to the motion for summary judgment 
the discovery process is continuing and the court has set no schedule to address the still pending summary judgment motion 
corning intends to continue to defend this action vigorously 
based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management believes that the likelihood of a materially adverse verdict is remote 
in december and january  corning and three of its officers and directors were named defendants and served in four different lawsuits alleging violations of the us securities laws in connection with corning s november offering of billion zero coupon convertible debentures  due november and million shares of common stock 
these four lawsuits  as well as others filed with the court and not yet served  are pending in the united states district court for the western district of new york and seek class action status 
corning has not yet answered these lawsuits and there has been no determination if they will proceed as a class action or who will be lead counsel for plaintiffs 
management is prepared to defend these lawsuits vigorously and  recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  believes it has strong defenses to the claims alleged in the complaints 
shin etsu quartz products company 
in july and february  shin etsu quartz products company filed two patent suits in japan against corning for alleged patent infringement of two patents relating to the properties of fused silica materials used in the optical components of stepper machines 
the suits request damages and an injunction preventing sales of infringing products in japan 
corning has denied infringement  has argued that the patents are invalid or unenforceable  and has filed a separate action to invalidate the second of the two patents 
in june  the japanese court ordered settlement discussions involving both patents in suit 
in late september  shin etsu withdrew from these discussions and has requested that the court rule on the matters before it 
corning intends to defend these suits vigorously 
while recognizing that litigation is inherently uncertain  based upon the information developed to date  management believes that corning has strong defenses to shin etsu s claims 
hereaus quarzglass gmbh 
in july  hereaus quarzglass gmbh filed a patent infringement suit in germany against corning for alleged patent infringement of a european patent relating to certain properties of fused silica glass used in the optical components of stepper machines 
the suit requests damages and for corning to refrain from importing or selling infringing products in germany 
management believes that the hereaus patent is either not infringed  or is invalid 
management is prepared to defend this action vigorously and  recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  believes it has strong defenses to the hereaus claims 
corning also filed an action in december in us federal court seeking a ruling that the us counterpart to the hereaus patent jointly owned with shin etsu in the us be declared invalid and not infringed 
hereaus and corning have had settlement discussions and corning management is optimistic that the matter can be resolved amicably 
management  however  is prepared to defend this action vigorously and  recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  believes it has strong defenses to the hereaus claims 
pittsburgh corning corporation 
corning and ppg industries  inc each own of the capital stock of pittsburgh corning corporation pcc 
pcc and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos 
on april   pcc filed for chapter reorganization in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania 
as of the bankruptcy filing  pcc had in excess of  open claims and now has in excess of  open claims 
in the bankruptcy court  pcc obtained a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions against its two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time the injunction period in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for pcc 
the injunction period has been extended until april  under the terms of the bankruptcy court s order  pcc  ppg industries and corning will have days following expiration of the injunction period to seek removal and transfer of stayed cases that have not been resolved through a plan of reorganization 
as a result of pcc s bankruptcy filing  corning recorded an after tax charge of million in the first quarter of to impair its entire investment in pcc and discontinued recognition of equity earnings 
at the time pcc filed for bankruptcy protection  there were approximately  claims pending against corning alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to pcc s asbestos products 
although the outcome of litigation and the bankruptcy case is uncertain  management believes that the separate corporate status of pcc will continue to be upheld 
management is continuing to investigate corning s options for defending claims against it  which might include vigorously defending itself on all fronts  or exploring a global settlement through the bankruptcy process 
it is probable that there will be intensive negotiations throughout the first half of concerning terms of pcc s plan of reorganization  including whether or not corning and its insurers may participate by making a contribution in exchange for a release 
management cannot estimate the probability that corning will be able to secure such a release upon terms and conditions satisfactory to corning and its insurers 
the range of cost for these options net of insurance cannot be estimated at this time 
corning is named in approximately  other cases alleging injuries from asbestos and those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to corning to date 
although asbestos litigation is inherently difficult  and the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management believes these matters will be resolved without a materially adverse impact on corning s financial position 
if corning and its insurers agree to a global settlement through the bankruptcy process  such outcome may be material to the results of operations of the period in which such costs  if any  are recognized 
astrium 
in december of  astrium  sas and astrium  ltd 
filed a complaint for negligence in the united states district court for the central district of california against trw  inc  pilkington optronics inc  corning netoptix  inc  ofc corporation and optical filter corporation claiming damages in excess of million 
the complaint alleges that certain cover glasses for solar arrays used to generate electricity from solar energy on satellites sold by astrium s corporate successor were negligently coated by netoptix or its subsidiaries prior to corning s acquisition of netoptix in such a way that the amount of electricity the satellite can produce and their effective life were materially reduced 
corning has denied that the coatings produced by netoptix or its subsidiaries caused the damage alleged in the complaint  or that it is legally liable for any damages which astrium may have experienced 
formal discovery has just begun  few depositions have been taken  and it is too early to form a definitive opinion about the outcome of the litigation 
based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain  management believes that there are strong defenses to these claims and believes they will be resolved without material impact on corning s financial statements 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders none part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters this information is included in note common shareholders equity to the consolidated financial statements  quarterly operating results and related market data  five years in review historical comparison  and investor information  appearing on pages and through item selected financial data this information is included in five years in review historical comparison appearing on pages and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corning s financial results in deteriorated significantly from as capital spending in the telecommunications industry diminished  the demand for premium fiber declined considerably in the second quarter and the downturn in the us economy in the latter half of the year negatively impacted all of corning s businesses 
as a result  sales and earnings fell in all three of corning s operating segments 
corning impaired goodwill and other intangible assets in its photonic technologies business totaling approximately billion and recorded million to write down excess and obsolete inventory 
as a result of the declining performance and expectations  management took several steps throughout the year to reduce its cost structure 
those actions included the following incurred pre tax charges of million related to actions to reduce overall headcount by approximately  employees and impair long lived assets including the closing of seven major plants  primarily in the telecommunications and advanced materials segments  idled fiber manufacturing facilities for most of the fourth quarter  and reduced capital expenditures in from the originally planned investment of billion to billion and lowered the capital budget for to under million 
results of operations consolidated net sales for were billion  a decrease from excluding the impact of acquisitions  corning s consolidated sales in decreased compared to sales declines for occurred in all operating segments  but were most pronounced in the telecommunications segment where sales fell 
consolidated sales for were billion  a increase over sales of billion 
excluding acquisitions  sales in increased over in  corning incurred a loss from continuing operations of billion  or per share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per share  in and income from continuing operations of million  or per share  in the loss is largely attributable to a charge of approximately billion billion after tax in the second quarter to impair goodwill and certain other intangible assets of the photonic technologies business 
corning s results for the year were also impacted by charges for restructuring actions of million million after tax and minority interest which included charges for headcount reductions  exit costs and impairment of plant and equipment 
further discussion of these charges begins under impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring actions and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
corning recorded an operating charge of million million after tax in the second quarter to write down excess and obsolete inventory  primarily in the photonic technologies business 
corning recorded operating charges totaling million million after tax in the fourth quarter for the following million related to the release of restrictions on shares of corning common stock held by employees  million to write down excess and obsolete inventory in the photonic technologies business  and million to write down an investment in intellectual property 
income and earnings per share from continuing operations declined and  respectively  between and primarily due to substantial non cash acquisition related charges incurred in the charges included gains and losses on the disposition and restructuring of businesses  purchased in process research and development iprd charges  other acquisition related charges and impairment losses 
in addition  as a result of its acquisition strategy  corning began to record significant amounts of amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill in these amounts increased in despite the impairment charges 
see non segment results for a discussion of these items 
corning believes a better understanding of the changes in its operating results is provided by comparing its operating results on a pro forma basis 
corning retroactively changed its definition of pro forma net income in the fourth quarter of to include the amortization of purchased intangibles in the calculation of pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share 
pro forma results for and have been restated for the change and are presented below 
pro forma net income excludes impairment and amortization of goodwill  impairment of other intangible assets  restructuring actions  purchased iprd charges  one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring items 
this measure is not in accordance with  or an alternative for  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
it should be considered supplemental data

corning s results for weakened significantly over the course of the year 
quarterly revenues and pro forma net income loss were as follows in millions qtr 
qtr 
qtr 
qtr 
revenue    pro forma net income loss the first half of the year was impacted as capital spending in the north american long haul sector declined  thus lowering demand for premium fiber and photonic products used in new networks 
the situation intensified in the third quarter as carriers in north america and other regions began to delay purchases of single mode fiber  particularly in september 
finally  corning s businesses in advanced materials and information display also began experiencing the effects of a slowing us economy as the events of september th disrupted the markets and the economy even further 
outlook corning believes that will be a very challenging year as industry conditions experienced in the second half of extend into management expects first quarter revenues to approximate the fourth quarter of management does not expect recovery to begin until late  or early as a result  management expects sales for to be significantly below levels and anticipates corning will continue to incur losses in the short term 
corning expects to realize cost savings from restructuring actions taken in  however  these improvements may be offset by pricing pressures in several key businesses 
management believes corning has ample liquidity to meet its funding needs for corning finished the year with billion in cash and short term investments and an unused revolving credit facility of billion 
management s focus in will be to reduce corning s cash requirements to manageable levels and restore its operations to profitability 
corning s long term strategy remains unchanged 
corning will continue to make significant investments in research and development for all segments and will invest in the expansion of the liquid crystal display business and the development of diesel substrates during this industry downturn 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during the first half of  corning experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of its telecommunications segment  primarily in the photonic technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry 
during the second quarter  major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed 
as a result  management determined that the growth prospects of this business were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods 
corning reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
as a result of the business conditions noted above  corning concluded such an assessment was required for its photonic technologies business in the second quarter 
corning assesses recoverability of the carrying value based upon cumulative expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
as a result of this test  corning determined that the long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles acquired from pirelli in december  as well as those of the unit into which netoptix corporation acquired in may had been integrated  were not recoverable 
corning s policy is to write down long lived assets to fair value in such circumstances 
management estimated fair value using several techniques 
while each method generated comparable fair values  management adjusted the assets to estimates based on average multiples of forecasted revenues and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies with operations in the optical component market segment 
in the second quarter  corning recorded pre tax charges of  million to impair a significant portion of goodwill and million to impair other intangible assets 
of the total charge of  million   million related to the acquisition of the pirelli optical components and devices business the pirelli transaction and  million related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of netoptix corporation 
restructuring actions corning has approved and executed several restructuring actions throughout the year 
these actions and the charges relating to them are described below 
in the first quarter of  corning reduced its workforce by approximately  positions  primarily in the photonic technologies and hardware and equipment businesses 
these workforce reductions included mostly hourly production workers and resulted in minimal severance charges 
in april  corning completed an additional workforce reduction of approximately  positions in photonic technologies  including both hourly and salaried employees 
the second quarter reductions resulted in a restructuring charge of million million after tax 
in the third quarter of  additional actions were approved and undertaken  primarily in the telecommunications segment  which included the following closure of three manufacturing facilities in the photonic technologies business  resulting in the elimination of approximately positions  and elimination of approximately  positions worldwide in the optical fiber and cable business 
this action included a voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations 
as a result of these actions  corning recorded a total charge of million million after tax which included a restructuring charge of million and a charge to impair plant and equipment of million in the third quarter 
the restructuring charge included million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges 
in response to the continued deteriorating business condition  management approved and recorded the following restructuring actions in the fourth quarter closure or consolidation of several manufacturing locations as well as smaller businesses across all operating segments  discontinuation of its initiative in corning microarray technology products  part of corning s life sciences business  and further headcount reduction of approximately  positions across all businesses  research and staff organizations 
this action also included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations 
as a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter  corning recorded a charge in the quarter of million million after tax and minority interest which included a restructuring charge of million and a charge to impair plant and equipment of million 
the restructuring charge included million for pension and postretirement termination benefits and million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the expected separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from that asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset 
a significant portion of the assets impaired was recently acquired  or built in connection with capacity expansions in anticipation of future demand 
most of the impaired facilities are currently available for sale  others will be demolished 
the impaired equipment will be auctioned  sold  or disposed during the facilities closed in the year primarily relate to the photonics and optical fiber and cable businesses that corning is not exiting 
the operations being exited comprise the majority of the lighting business of the advanced materials segment 
this business is not material to corning s revenues or financial results 
in summary  corning s restructuring actions totaled million in pre tax charges for the year ended december   of which million related to exit costs primarily for lease termination and contract cancellation charges 
approximately one third of this total charge is expected to be paid in cash 
the total number of positions eliminated was approximately  as of december   approximately  of the  employees had been separated under the plans 
corning expects to realize savings of approximately million annually beginning in as a result of these restructuring actions 
the savings are expected to be realized primarily in cost of sales and also in selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses 
non cash charges for employee related costs were million with million for pension and postretirement termination benefits and million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges 
curtailment charges were recorded primarily due to the decrease in expected future years of service

corning also includes the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with corning s operating segments in segment net income 
corning retroactively changed its definition of segment net income in the fourth quarter of to include the amortization of purchased intangibles 
in addition during the quarter ended march   corning realigned one product line from the advanced materials segment into the telecommunications segment 
segment results for and have been restated for the changes and are presented below 
segment amounts exclude revenues  expenses and equity earnings not specifically identifiable to segments 
segment net income excludes impairment and amortization of goodwill  impairment of other intangible assets  restructuring actions  purchased iprd charges  other one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring items 
this measure is not in accordance with gaap and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
corning prepared the financial results for its three operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which corning management internally disaggregates financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
corning has allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than it would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the nonrecurring items noted above are excluded from segment net income  but are described more fully in non segment results 
telecommunications in millions net sales    research  development and engineering expenses interest expense segment loss earnings before minority interest and equity earnings minority interest in losses earnings of subsidiaries equity in earnings of associated companies segment net loss income segment loss earnings before minority interest and equity earnings as a percentage of segment sales segment net loss income as a percentage of segment sales the telecommunications segment produces optical fiber and cable  optical hardware and equipment  photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide telecommunications industry 
vs 
sales in the telecommunications segment decreased from to billion 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the sales decline was 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to sales volume decreases in most businesses throughout the segment as capital spending in the telecommunications industry decreased significantly 
segment net income fell precipitously compared to s strong results as net income in the optical fiber and cable business was more than offset by losses in all other businesses 
the loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonic products reduced gross margins and the segment incurred operating charges totaling million million after tax to write down excess and obsolete inventory  including estimated purchase commitments  further lowering gross margin percentages 
sales in the optical fiber and cable business in remained flat at billion compared with  although sales declined significantly in the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined compared to the lack of growth reflects the loss of volume in premium products beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in long haul demand as capital spending for network buildouts diminished and the business began to experience volume decreases in sales of single mode fiber in the third quarter 
as a result  most fiber manufacturing facilities were idled in the fourth quarter 
overall  fiber and cable volume decreased approximately for the year as a result of an increase of approximately in the first half of the year offset by a decrease of approximately in the second half 
the weighted average price for corning s optical fiber and cable products remained relatively stable compared to as higher prices were offset by significantly decreased volumes for premium products 
premium fiber as a percentage of total fiber demand was approximately in net income for the optical fiber and cable business decreased over compared to as the loss of sales volume in premium products was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin single mode products 
in response to reduced demand for fiber products  corning announced it will permanently close its optical fiber operations in deeside  north wales and its cabling operations in saskatoon  canada in addition to temporarily ceasing production at smaller cabling facilities 
sales in the hardware and equipment business declined in to million compared to billion in excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined compared to the decrease was due to lower sales volumes as capital spending in the cable television industry fell significantly from prior year levels 
business performance decreased significantly to a small loss in due to considerably lower sales volumes 
this business reduced its headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility 
the photonic technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components primarily for the optical amplification market 
sales in the photonic technologies business declined over to million compared with billion in the sales decrease reflects significant declines in orders from major customers caused by the decrease in capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
the business incurred a significant operating loss for the year as a result of lower sales volumes  excess capacity  a higher fixed cost structure and charges for excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters 
during the second quarter  major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and cancelled orders already placed 
as a result  management determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their product life cycle 
corning recorded a charge to write down excess and obsolete inventory  including estimated purchase commitments  of million million after tax in cost of sales in the second quarter of the business recorded an additional charge of million million after tax in the fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for corning has  or is in the process of disposing all such inventory except approximately million 
corning has retained and isolated this inventory  and in the unlikely event that product is sold  corning will fully disclose the impact on its margins 
corning announced a downsizing of the photonic technologies business and closed the following three manufacturing facilities in benton park facility in benton township  pa  corning lasertron s facility in nashua  nh  and monroe park manufacturing and development operations in henrietta  ny 
in addition  corning scaled back its photonic technologies operations in erwin park  ny and the remainder of its photonic facilities to adjust its manufacturing capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations 
the business reduced its headcount approximately from peak employment levels in the controls and connectors business manufactures control systems  switches and encoders 
sales in this business decreased to million in compared to million in lower sales volume was the primary reason for the decline due to the weak us economy 
the business incurred an insignificant loss for the year compared to an insignificant profit in due to the depressed volume 
the optical networking business manufactures wavelength management products and optical switch modules 
the business began shipping products to customers in the third quarter of sales for were million and comprised mostly of dynamic spectral equalizers  compared to partial year sales of million in the loss in was greater than primarily due to the million pre tax write down of an investment in intellectual property 
in addition  volumes were lower than expected and development spending increased 
sales to corning s largest customer in were under of consolidated and telecommunications segment sales 
vs 
sales in the telecommunications segment increased over to billion 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales growth was 
the sales growth in the segment was led primarily by volume gains in the optical fiber and cable business  hardware and equipment and photonic technologies businesses 
segment net income more than doubled in compared to the percentage increase in segment net income exceeded the increase in sales  reflecting an overall increase in segment gross margin percentage and a decrease in research  development and engineering as a percentage of sales 
sales in the optical fiber and cable business in increased approximately over to approximately billion 
the increase in sales resulted chiefly from the impact of acquisitions and strong volume gains for leaf r optical fiber 
volume growth continued to be driven by regional  local and long haul telephone companies and cable television operators  including significant european carriers benefiting from continued deregulation of the telecommunications industry throughout europe 
approximately million of the increase in optical fiber and cable sales primarily resulted from the following acquisitions the acquisition of the remaining interest in siecor gmbh and the cabling business previously owned by siemens in the first quarter of  and the acquisition of the optical cable business from bicc  plc and the remaining interest in optical waveguides australia  pty 
ltd 
in the second quarter of excluding the impact of these acquisitions  sales in the optical fiber and cable business increased for the year principally due to sales volume gains of almost  reflecting continued strong demand for corning s premium fiber products 
volume of premium fiber and cable products  including corning s leaf optical fiber  more than doubled over the same period in price declines ranged between and for corning s optical fiber and cable products in comparison with last year 
the weighted average optical fiber and cable price in remained relatively stable compared to the rate of price declines for cabled products slowed throughout commensurate with the worldwide tightening of optical fiber supply 
net income from the optical fiber and cable business increased approximately in compared to the strong earnings performance is due to volume growth in high data rate products  relatively stable pricing and a shift to a higher premium product mix 
sales in the telecommunications hardware and equipment business increased over in to approximately billion 
this increase resulted from a higher sales volume of existing products  the siemens transaction and particularly strong demand from cable television customers  offset in part by price declines 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales increased over overall net income almost doubled over largely due to sales volume increases 
sales in the photonic technologies business more than doubled over to approximately billion 
the business realized strong sales volume gains in led by new product sales  growth in amplifier sales and acquisitions 
the operating performance in this business improved in as the business became solidly profitable due to strong volume  productivity gains and more cost efficient access to pump lasers achieved through the acquisition of lasertron 
corning continued to invest heavily in research and development in this business 
sales in the controls and connectors business increased in to million 
net income from this business improved slightly  moving from breakeven in to modest profitability in  primarily due to sales volume increases 
during the third quarter of  the optical networking business began shipments of its wavelength management products to customers 
sales for were million 
this business operated at a loss due to significant research and development investments 
sales to corning s largest customer accounted for approximately of the telecommunications segment sales in  including a significant portion of total sales in the photonic technologies business  but under of consolidated sales 
outlook management believes the weak conditions in the telecommunications industry experienced in the second part of will continue into first quarter sales are expected to approximate fourth quarter levels  however  losses are expected to decrease somewhat due to restructuring actions taken and the absence of nonrecurring charges 
management does not expect a recovery in this industry until late  or early corning anticipates that recovery in this segment is dependent on capital spending by network operators and cable television entities as they add fiber to metro access networks in the us  and on the level of demand in international markets 
as the industry currently has significant excess capacity  price pressure is expected to continue throughout advanced materials in millions net sales   research  development and engineering expenses interest expense segment earnings before equity earnings equity in earnings of associated companies segment net income segment earnings before equity earnings as a percentage of segment sales segment net income as a percentage of segment sales the advanced materials segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass  glass ceramic and polymer technologies 
vs 
sales in for the advanced materials segment decreased to million compared to sales of billion in excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined 
sales increases in the life sciences business were more than offset by declines in the environmental technologies and semiconductor materials businesses 
segment net income also declined in as the segment recorded net income of million compared to million in for a decrease 
the decline in profitability was primarily due to weaker performance by the environmental technologies and semiconductor materials businesses partially offset by improved performance by the life sciences business 
sales in the environmental technologies business  the largest business in the segment and a manufacturer of catalytic converter substrates  decreased in to million 
the business experienced lower sales volumes compared to due to decreased vehicle production 
volume growth in asia was more than offset by declining volumes in north america and europe 
earnings for the year were down almost primarily due to lower sales volumes  manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new ultra thin wall products  excess capacity and start up costs in south africa and china 
in october  corning announced the approval of a new diesel emission control product manufacturing facility 
the new plant will be located in erwin  ny with construction to begin in initial production of substrate and filter products is expected in early sales in the life sciences business  a supplier of advanced microplates and other laboratory products  increased over to million 
the improvement was primarily due to an increase in sales volume 
earnings in the base business almost doubled over primarily due to a shift to higher margin products in sales mix along with improvements in manufacturing costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
overall earnings in the business were diluted due to the investment in microarray technology which corning discontinued at the end of sales in corning s other advanced materials businesses  including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products  decreased in to million 
excluding the acquisition of tropel in march  sales decreased 
the decrease was due to softness in the market for ophthalmic products and high purity fused silica 
earnings for the year were approximately breakeven and down slightly compared to lower sales volumes and production slowdowns were partially offset by a marginal increase in equity earnings from eurokera  a french based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops  resulting in comparable earnings between years 
corning plans to exit the lighting and tubing businesses in  and has announced the shutdown of manufacturing facilities in greenville  oh and corning  ny 
vs 
sales in the advanced materials segment were relatively flat compared to at approximately billion  chiefly due to growth in the environmental technologies business  which was offset by a sales decline due to the divestiture of the quanterra business in january and flat performance in other advanced materials businesses 
excluding the impact of the divestiture  sales improved 
segment net income declined in as earnings improvements in other advanced materials businesses were more than offset by decreased performance in environmental technologies and life sciences while equity earnings remained flat 
sales in the environmental technologies business increased almost over to million 
the growth in sales resulted from a strong global auto market in and increased market penetration of corning s thin wall products coupled with increases in the base substrate business that was partially offset by the weak euro 
earnings in this business decreased approximately  principally due to start up costs of new plants in south africa and china and elevated research and development spending on diesel substrate programs 
sales in the life sciences business of million were down over in comparison to as the business continued to see a shift in spending in the pharmaceutical industry from traditional products to genomics 
the business reported a small loss in compared to a modest profit in the loss was primarily due to an increased commitment to research and development and marketing costs associated with the launch of corning s microarray technology products in the third quarter of excluding start up costs related to microarrays  earnings were flat compared to sales in corning s other advanced materials businesses were relatively flat  compared to  at approximately million 
the flat performance was due to elevated sales of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials business  which was offset by the impact of the divestiture of quanterra in january 
excluding the divestiture of quanterra  sales improved over 
earnings from these businesses more than doubled over due largely to increased volume and despite flat performances from eurokera and keraglass  a french based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops 
outlook the environmental technologies businesses experienced slow sales at the end of and that trend is expected to continue into sales growth in environmental technologies will be dependent upon an overall economic recovery in the us  as well as europe  evidenced by increased vehicle production 
the life sciences business is expected to continue its growth trends in the other businesses in this segment experienced sales declines over the latter half of the year and that trend is expected to continue into growth in other advanced materials businesses will depend on recovery in the semiconductor materials business and the general economy

sales in the information display segment decreased in to million as sales decreases in the conventional video components and display technologies businesses more than offset an increase in the precision lens business 
segment net income declined with each business deteriorating compared to sales in the display technology business  a leading supplier of ultra thin glass substrates used to produce flat panel display  decreased to million in a significant shift in customer demand from japan to korea caused volume to increase approximately at samsung corning precision glass company ltd 
samsung corning precision  an equity affiliate and korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass  and in the consolidated business 
this volume growth  when offset by the impact of price declines and the deterioration of the yen resulted in the sales decline of 
earnings for decreased approximately  primarily due to lower operating margins driven by pricing pressures  start up costs incurred for the may opening of a new manufacturing facility in taiwan and additional development and engineering expenses for eagle tm  a new glass substrate used in active matrix liquid crystal displays 
additionally  equity earnings from samsung corning precision were down over compared to primarily due to corning having a smaller ownership interest in the company in vs 
sales in the conventional video components business  a manufacturer of optically pure  mechanically precise face plates and funnels for larger screen television tubes  were million  down compared to the decrease was primarily due to a weak us economy and increased competitive pricing pressure 
earnings were down almost due to lower sales volumes  decreased margins  a production slowdown in the fourth quarter and lower equity earnings 
samsung corning company ltd 
samsung corning  a manufacturer based in south korea that produces glass panels and funnels for television and display monitors  also experienced lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing pressure  and thus lower earnings 
corning owns of samsung corning and accounts for this investment under the equity method 
sales in the precision lens business  a manufacturer of lens systems for projection video and a specialist at making lenses from optical plastics  increased to million in the increase was due to the growth of digital projection television in the us and china where the demand for high definition television was growing 
despite the increase in sales  earnings for decreased approximately primarily due to increased research and development spending and manufacturing costs related to capacity expansion of projection television assemblies 
vs 
sales in the information display segment increased in to million  primarily due to strong growth in the display technologies and precision lens businesses 
segment net income more than doubled  as did equity earnings  reflecting increased earnings in each business over sales in the conventional video components business remained relatively flat at million for  compared to  due to slightly lower volumes offset in part by price increases as the supply of television glass began to tighten 
earnings in this business increased compared to  primarily due to higher equity earnings  in addition to cost reductions and the impact of volume and mix as a shift to higher premium products occurred in the increase in equity earnings reflected improved volume and stable pricing at samsung corning 
sales in the display technologies business in increased over to million 
this significant increase was the result of continued strong demand for the business liquid crystal glass for flat panel displays  led by increased penetration into the desktop display market 
earnings in this business more than doubled compared to  reflecting strong volume gains and stable pricing 
also equity earnings from samsung corning precision more than doubled largely due to strong volume gains in the korean marketplace 
sales in the precision lens business increased in to million as a result of strong volume growth for projection televisions driven by demand for larger size digital television sets in the entertainment market sector 
earnings in this business increased over primarily due to volume gains  manufacturing efficiencies and the refocusing of product lines 
during the fourth quarter of  samsung corning recognized a nonoperating gain of million from the divestment of its interest in samsung corning precision 
corning s million share of this gain is excluded from segment equity earnings 
outlook management expects the display technologies business to see growth in sales volume in  primarily due to increased penetration of flat panel monitors 
this business will continue to be impacted by its exposure to the exchange rate of the yen 
management expects the soft economy to continue to impact the conventional video components business in as low demand and overcapacity of glass exert downward pressure on prices 
in addition  changes in the competitive environment in the conventional television glass market may present significant challenges to this business 
the projection lens business anticipates modest growth that will be dependent on global economic recovery 
non segment results corning s non segment results include the operations of steuben  a crystal glass manufacturer  and equity earnings from small nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with corning s three operating segments 
in addition  the results of operating segments does not include impairment and amortization of goodwill  impairment of purchased intangibles  restructuring actions  purchased iprd charges  other one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring charges 
amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill totaled million million after tax in compared to million million after tax in and million million after tax in amortization of goodwill increased in as it included charges for the entire year related to transactions completed late in the amortization of goodwill was reduced by the impairment of goodwill charge taken in the second quarter of effective january   corning adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which eliminates the amortization of goodwill 
the new standard is discussed further under new accounting standards and note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonrecurring non segment results for are discussed earlier in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and restructuring actions 
nonrecurring items in and are described below 
other restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of  corning discontinued recognition of equity earnings from pittsburgh corning corporation pcc and recorded a charge to impair its investment for million due to pcc s decision to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under chapter for asbestos litigation 
see legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
in the third quarter of  corning recognized an impairment charge of million million after tax in connection with management s decision to sell quanterra incorporated 
in the fourth quarter of  corning released restructuring reserves totaling million million after tax related to early retirement incentives offered in after determining the total cost of the incentive package would be less than anticipated 
nonoperating gains in  samsung corning recorded a fourth quarter nonoperating gain of million from the divestment of its interest in samsung corning precision 
corning s million share of this gain is included in equity in earnings of associated companies 
in  corning recorded a first quarter nonoperating gain of million million after tax on the sale of quanterra incorporated to severn trent laboratories for approximately million

in the first quarter of  corning recorded a charge for acquisition costs related to the merger of oak industries  inc of million million after tax primarily comprised of legal and investment banking fees 
charges for purchased iprd are described in more detail under in process research and development 
income taxes corning s effective benefit tax rate for continuing operations was  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the three years are not comparable  primarily due to the significant amounts of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in and  along with significant charges for impairment of goodwill in and iprd in  as these charges are not tax deductible 
these items reduce the benefit in and increase the expense in note to the consolidated financial statements reconciles the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources corning is meeting its funding needs through operating cash flows  outside borrowings and equity issuances 
at december   corning had billion in cash and short term investments and an unused revolving credit facility of billion 
cash flows and working capital sources of cash flow in were primarily operations  generating cash of billion and financing transactions primarily issuances of public debt and equity securities providing cash of billion 
corning used cash of billion in investing activities  primarily for capital expenditures and the purchase of short term investments 
cash provided by operations in was comparable with results  despite the decrease in net income due to the magnitude of non cash charges  increased depreciation and second half reduction in working capital as sales declined 
corning expects cash from operations in to be significantly less than  primarily due to lower operating earnings and restructuring payments 
if sales improve from fourth quarter levels  corning expects to use cash as working capital increases commensurate with higher demand 
cash and short term investments on hand at december   access to commercial paper markets and the revolving credit facility are alternative sources of liquidity 
these vehicles are discussed separately below 
corning has invested significant cash in capital expansions in the last three years 
during  corning reduced its capital spending program from its original plan of billion to conserve cash 
capital spending totaled billion  billion  including billion in accrued capital expenditures  and million in  and  respectively 
the high level of capital spending since relates primarily to capacity expansions in corning s telecommunications segment and expanded research and development facilities 
corning s capital spending program is expected to be less than million as all expansion related programs in the telecommunications segment are being delayed indefinitely 
expansions in are expected to be primarily in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses 
corning s net investment in short term instruments during was million  compared to its initial net investment of million in in  corning began investing its excess cash in highly liquid debt securities such as asset backed securities  municipal and corporate bonds and us treasury notes 
these investments are on deposit with a major financial institution 
corning raised approximately million in august through the issuance of million shares of common stock 
the proceeds are expected to finance the acquisition of lucent technologies controlling equity interests in shanghai fiber optic co  ltd 
and beijing fiber optic cable co  ltd 
this transaction is expected to close in the first half of in addition  in november corning completed a convertible debt offering of million  due november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
corning intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes 
dividends paid to common shareholders in totaled million compared with million in and million in on july   corning announced the discontinuation of the payment of dividends on its common stock 
corning s working capital decreased from billion at the end of to billion at the end of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of  compared to at the end of corning s working capital in and included large cash and short term investment balances 
excluding cash and short term investments  corning s working capital for was million  or a decrease of million  compared to million in the decrease in non cash components of working capital was primarily due to lower inventories and a significant decrease in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding in trade receivables decreased to days for the fourth quarter of  from days for the fourth quarter of as of december   corning had not provided vendor financing to any of its customers 
corning s long term debt as a percentage of total capital increased from at year end to at the end of the increase is primarily due to the reduction in shareholders equity arising from losses recorded in and the issuance of convertible debt in november financing matters and credit ratings commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december   totaled million with a weighted average maturity of days 
corning s commercial paper program is supported by the billion revolving credit facility with banks  expiring on august  as of december   there were no borrowings under the facility 
the facility includes a covenant requiring corning to maintain a total debt to capital ratio  as defined  not greater than 
at december   this ratio was 
corning s credit ratings as of march  were as follows rating agency rating rating last update long term debt commercial paper standard poor s a bbb a november  moody s a baa p november  fitch a bbb f february  a all three credit rating agencies have maintained a negative outlook which means a rating may be lowered 
should business performance decline from the levels experienced in the fourth quarter of  these ratings could receive further review for possible downgrade 
a downgrade in short term ratings could result in a significantly reduced ability to access the commercial paper market and higher borrowing costs 
corning s debt agreements do not include covenants that accelerate the maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in credit ratings 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in march  corning filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec that became effective in the first quarter 
the shelf permits the issuance of up to billion of various debt and equity securities 
as of december   corning s remaining capacity under its shelf registration was approximately billion 
corning s earnings were not adequate to cover its fixed charges principally interest and related charges on debt  primarily as a result of losses incurred in corning s telecommunication s segment and the impairment of goodwill 
corning s earnings may not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in management believes that corning has ample liquidity  retains satisfactory access to the capital markets and maintains unused  revolving credit facilities 
obligations  commitments and contingencies at december   the contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies of corning were as follows contractual cash obligations and thereafter total in millions long term debt    minimum rental commitments business combinations total contractual cash obligations    at december   future minimum lease payments to be received under a noncancelable sublease to quest diagnostics totaled million 
quest diagnostics  in turn  has a noncancelable sublease covering approximately million of the minimum lease payments due to corning 
corning has agreed to indemnify quest diagnostics should quest diagnostics sublessee default on the minimum lease payments 
additionally  corning continues to guarantee certain obligations of quest diagnostics totaling million 
other commercial commitments and contingencies amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period less than to to to years and total year years years years thereafter in millions performance bonds and guarantees contingent purchase price for acquisitions dow corning credit facility stand by letters of credit loan guarantees total other commercial commitments and contingencies at december   corning had guaranteed debt of equity affiliates totaling million 
in addition  corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones  stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the bankruptcy plan as described in note management believes the significant majority of the other guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
in process research and development corning completed a number of purchase acquisitions in as part of analyzing each of these acquisitions  corning made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
corning based this decision on a number of factors  including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market 
corning also considered its internal research resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology  if any 
corning expects to use the same decision process in the future 
in connection with the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method  management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions 
amounts allocated to purchased iprd were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry 
certain projects were acquired for which technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as interpreted by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  amounts assigned to iprd meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase 
the value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach  which discounts expected future debt free income to present value 
the discount rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target  adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project 
expected future debt free income was derived with the following considerations revenues were estimated based on relevant market size  growth trends in the industry and individual product sales cycles  estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses to maintain the products once they have been introduced  estimated tax expenses were specific to each acquired entity and its tax profile  and for certain projects  as appropriate  a return on core technology was deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations 
corning expects that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows over the five years following integration 
management expects to continue supporting the majority of these research and development efforts 
projects abandoned are noted below 
this support is not expected to change corning s research and development expense trends 
however  the timing and success of development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competition in the marketplace 
the following is a more detailed discussion of the valuations associated with acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded acquisition of pirelli s optical components and devices business on december   corning completed the pirelli transaction 
this business had a significant number of research and development projects ongoing at the time of acquisition of which were valued as iprd projects 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for this entity 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
corning recorded a non tax deductible iprd charge of million in the fourth quarter of costs to complete the in process research programs are expected to approximate million to million 
these projects have been categorized into four product technologies as follows lithium niobate modulators the business is developing a number of different lithium niobate modulators 
lithium niobate modulators are ideally suited for use in high speed  long haul optical communications networks 
the technology has been chosen by a majority of long haul equipment suppliers because it has the best combination of optical  electronic and reliability performance 
five of the research projects qualified as iprd projects  and the completion percentages of these five projects ranged from 
a non tax deductible charge of million was recognized and the value of individual modulator projects in process ranged from million to million 
submarine products the business had planned to develop high reliability nanometer nm pump laser chips and modules for submarine use 
these devices are components within an optical amplifier 
at the acquisition date  two iprd projects with completion percentages of and were valued 
a non tax deductible charge of million resulted from nm pump laser submarine projects in process 
individual research values were million and million 
as part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on july   corning abandoned this project 
this action did not have a material impact on cash flow  or the results of operations 
gratings at the date of acquisition  three qualifying gratings programs with completion percentages ranging from were valued 
a non tax deductible iprd charge of million resulted from gratings programs 
individual in process projects were valued between million and million 
as part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on july   corning abandoned this project 
this action did not have a material impact on cash flow  or the results of operations 
specialty fiber two specialty fiber programs at the business met the definition of iprd 
specialty fibers are used in conjunction with several other components to make an erbium doped fiber amplifier  which boosts the strength of the optical signal 
at the acquisition date  these projects were and complete 
a non tax deductible iprd charge of million resulted from specialty fiber programs  with the largest program being valued at million 
intellisense on june   corning completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of intellisense  a manufacturer and developer of micro electro mechanical systems mems  or small electro mechanical  micro fabricated devices 
mems technology  when integrated with optics and packaging expertise  enables the development of optical add drop switches and optical cross connects  that are expected to play a key role in the development and build out of the optical networking layer 
as of the acquisition date  intellisense had three qualifying research projects underway 
these research and development projects are anticipated to result primarily in the development of new telecommunications products 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for intellisense 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
corning recorded a million iprd charge in the second quarter of no project valued exceeded million 
if none of the projects are successfully completed  corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure of any single project would not materially impact corning s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in all material respects  the research projects have progressed as planned at acquisition 
nz applied technologies on may   corning completed the acquisition of nzat 
nzat was developing a line of high speed  solid state components for dense wavelength division multiplexing systems  such as variable optical attenuators  that will meet industry demands for speed and quality 
of these projects  four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased iprd as of the acquisition date 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for nzat 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
a million non tax deductible iprd charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from million to million 
if none of the projects are successfully completed  corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure of any single project would not materially impact corning s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in the fourth quarter of  nzat completed certain product development milestones for its variable optical attenuator products 
photonics technology research center on february   corning acquired ptrc 
located in suffolk  uk  the ptrc had extensive research and development efforts underway at the acquisition date including work on planar integrated optics  semiconductor optical amplifiers  electro absorption modulators and optical networking devices 
seven projects were determined to meet the criteria for purchased iprd 
projected debt free income was determined for each of the projects and initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for ptrc 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
a million million after tax iprd charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from less than million to million 
if none of the projects are successfully completed  corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure of any single project would not materially impact corning s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
corning has accrued approximately million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december  based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of corning s estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
market risk disclosures corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
corning s exposure to exchange rate effects includes exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact corning s net equity 
corning s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to japan  korea  taiwan and western european countries 
corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on corning s operating results 
corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where its foreign subsidiaries or corning incorporated enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
corning does not hold or issue any derivative contracts that hedge its foreign currency denominated net asset exposures 
corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
equity in earnings of associated companies has historically represented a significant amount of corning s income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of associated companies was million in with foreign based affiliates comprising of this amount 
exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies 
corning uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts  open option contracts  foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
the nature of corning s foreign exchange rate risk exposures have not changed materially from december   however corning s acquisition activity in has expanded its presence in international markets and thus increased the degree of its exposures overall 
in  corning began investing in start up companies with emerging technologies in the telecommunications industry 
these investments are recorded at cost and contain a high degree of risk as the technologies under development may never yield marketable products 
investments of this nature totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
corning routinely assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of these investments and will impair these assets when a decline in value is other than temporary 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
the critical judgments impacting the financial statements include the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory write down and realizability determinations  salvage values of assets impaired in connection with restructuring actions  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  and purchased iprd 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters  or future events that are inherently uncertain 
specifically  in its assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  management made estimates of the fair values based upon forecasted revenues and operations 
refer to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for further discussion of management s determination of its impairment charge 
an assessment of inventory realizability requires management to forecast sales and future technological developments 
an estimation of salvage values associated with assets to be disposed of requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating real estate markets and timing of disposal 
corning has reduced its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in so doing  corning has estimated future taxable income in determining the valuation allowance 
valuing purchased iprd requires management to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows resulting from new product introductions 
corning used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other provisions  all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited for transactions initiated after june  in addition  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
sfas no 
was effective for corning on january  an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption must be performed within one year 
at december   goodwill approximated billion 
corning does not anticipate a transitional impairment charge from the adoption of the standard 
the following table presents a reconciliation of reported net loss income and loss earnings per share to adjusted net loss income and loss earnings per share  as if sfas no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
corning is required to implement sfas no 
on january  corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
corning is required to implement sfas no 
on january  corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
