our standards based critical path communications platform  built to perform reliably at the scale of public networks  delivers the industry s lowest total cost of ownership for messaging solutions and lays a solid foundation for next generation communications services 
critical path s customers are corporate enterprises  carriers and service providers  postal authorities and government agencies 
critical path was founded in and is headquartered in san francisco  california with offices throughout north america  europe  asia and latin america 
from inception through  our primary source of revenue came from service fees related to hosted messaging 
through a series of acquisitions during and  we expanded our product offerings to include a wide range of messaging and collaboration licensed software and solutions 
during we evaluated our various products  services  facilities and the business plan under which we were operating 
as part of this evaluation  we reviewed the products and services we sell to customers  the locations in which we operate  and the manner in which we go to market with our core product and service offerings 
in connection with this review  we implemented and completed a three part strategic restructuring plan that involved reorganizing critical path s product and service offerings around a group of core communication solutions 
the three primary elements of the plan included focusing on core communication solutions  workforce reduction  and facilities and operations consolidation 
additionally  we implemented an aggressive expense management plan to further reduce operating costs while maintaining strong customer service for our core solutions 
as of december  we had divested all of our non core products and services  reduced headcount by  reduced facilities and operations by and implemented other cost cutting measures  resulting in a significant reduction in overall operating expenses 
the non core products and services which were divested during  comprised approximately and of total revenues in the years ended december  and and were insignificant in these products and services are expected to be an insignificant part of critical path s revenue stream going forward 
additionally as of december   we had substantially completed an extensive assessment of our core hosted messaging services  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of associated with excess capacity and equipment 
as a result of these strategic initiatives  we have significantly reduced our overall operating expenses and we expect to realize significant future annual cost savings  as our quarterly operating cost structure  excluding special charges  has been reduced by nearly million since the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we closed a financing transaction with a group of investors led by general atlantic partners llc and its affiliates  and other investors including hutchison whampoa limited and affiliates and vectis group llc 
vectis group had previously been retained by the company to provide advice with respect to strategic alternatives and other management related services 
mr 
mcglashan  our chief executive officer  is a principal in the vectis group 
the financing transaction consisted of approximately million in gross cash proceeds and the retirement of million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes 
in connection with this transaction  we issued and sold four million shares of convertible preferred stock to several investors and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock to general atlantic and its affiliates 
the related proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  inclusive of a billion charge for impairment of long lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing  development of our technology and solution offerings  and related enhancements 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses through the end of  however we do not anticipate the need for additional financing prior to december  in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  acquisitions  recent restructuring and limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results  including gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
at december   we had employees  in comparison with  employees at december  and employees at december  we do not believe that our historical trends for revenues  expenses  or personnel are indicative of future results 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of critical path s financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical path believes the following are the most critical accounting policies underlying critical path s presentation of its financial condition and related operating results revenue recognition valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets  and estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized once the related products or services have been delivered and collection of all fees is considered probable 
we recognize revenues related to the sale of our licensed software products  hosted messaging and communication services  professional services and post contract customer support 
software license 
we derive software license revenues from perpetual and term licenses for our messaging  collaboration and identity management solutions 
software license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software to the customer has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
our revenue recognition policies require that revenues recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as software products  upgrades and enhancements  post contract customer support  installation  training or other services 
license software sales that involve multiple elements  including software license and undelivered maintenance and support and professional services  are recognized such that we allocate revenues to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values for the ongoing maintenance obligations are based upon the prices paid for the separate renewal of these services by the customer or upon substantive renewal rates stated in the contractual arrangements 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of other services  primarily professional services  is based upon substantive rates stated in the contractual arrangements or upon separate sales of these services at substantive rates 
if a multiple element arrangement includes services that are deemed essential to the functionality of a delivered element  we recognize the entire arrangement fee using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  individual contract revenues are recorded based on the percentage relationship of the contract costs incurred as compared to management s estimate of the total cost to complete the contract 
if fair value cannot be determined for more than one individual element of a multiple element arrangement  revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we also receive license fees from resellers under arrangements that do not provide product return or exchange rights 
revenues from reseller agreements may include a nonrefundable  advance royalty which is payable upon the signing of the contract and license fees based on the contracted value of our products purchased by the reseller 
guaranteed license fees from resellers  where no right of return exists  are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
non guaranteed per copy license fees from resellers are initially deferred and are recognized when they are reported as sold to end users by the reseller 
hosted messaging services 
we derive hosted messaging revenues related to fees for hosting services we offer related to our messaging and collaboration solutions 
these are primarily based upon monthly contractual per unit rates for the services involved  which are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
amounts billed or received in advance of service delivery  including but not limited to branding and set up fees  are initially deferred and subsequently recognized on a ratable basis over the expected term of the relationship beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
professional services 
we derive professional service revenues from fees primarily related to training  installation and configuration services 
the associated revenues are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
maintenance and support 
we derive maintenance and support service revenues from fees for post contract customer support agreements associated with product licenses 
such services typically include rights to future update and upgrade product releases and dial up phone services 
fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  which is generally one year 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment  when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized whenever the evaluation demonstrates that the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable 
in connection with the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the estimates of fair values were based upon the discounted estimated cash flows of critical path for the succeeding three years using a discount rate of and an estimated terminal value 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and an estimated terminal value  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rate was primarily based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
during and in connection with our strategic restructuring effort  an additional assessment of impairment was performed on certain of our remaining long lived assets 
the restructuring plan identified and formulated a plan to exit certain products and services that were determined to be non core to critical path s business strategy 
we reviewed the intangible assets related to these non core products and services and  as a result of the assessment  recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter to these assets 
additionally during the fourth quarter of  we performed an evaluation of long lived assets within our core business 
as a result of this assessment we recorded a further impairment charge 
this charge resulted from an impairment of assets associated with our core business  primarily the hosted messaging services  as we determined that we had excess capacity and equipment related to certain core products and services 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for this reason  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management must make estimates surrounding collectibility of our revenues and related accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical and current economic trends  previous bad debts  customer concentrations  credit worthiness of customers  and payment terms of customer accounts  when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates liabilities and contingencies at the end of each period 
the current financial statement presentation reflects management s best estimates of liabilities and pending litigation which are probable and where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record the minimum liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management may not be able to make an accurate estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will continue to assess the potential exposure related to our pending litigation and update our estimates and related disclosures 
such future revisions in our estimates could materially impact the financial results of critical path

we recognized million in software license revenues during  as compared to million in and none in the significant decrease in software license revenues between and was attributed to several factors that impacted our operating results during delays in information technology spending were experienced across many industries due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and these delays were exacerbated by circumstances at the company 
many potential customers who were evaluating our products delayed making decisions until they could gain a level of comfort in us as we emerged from our management transition and restructuring initiatives 
additionally  our sales organization was distracted by the termination and resignation of much of its leadership in the first quarter of and its focus on rebuilding also has caused a reduction in effectiveness 
the decrease in software license revenues was further exacerbated as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  these tragic events significantly impacted the world economic markets and delayed some of our licensed software sales with enterprise customers who operated in the affected areas or whose operations were disrupted by these events 
additionally  in connection with our restructuring initiative  we identified certain non core software license products  of which all have either been exited or sold to third parties 
software license revenues related to these non core products were approximately million in  down from million in we anticipate non core product revenues will be insignificant during software license revenues increased in as compared to as a result of the introduction of our software license product offerings related to messaging  directory and meta directory through our acquisitions of amplitude software corporation  isocor corporation  and peerlogic  inc hosted messaging 
we recognized million in hosted messaging revenue during  as compared to million in and million in this decrease in as compared with resulted from our restructuring initiative  as we identified certain non core hosted messaging services  of which all have either been exited or sold to third parties

there were no professional services revenues in professional services revenues increased in as compared to as a result of the introduction of our software license product and professional services offerings related to messaging  directory and meta directory software products added through our acquisitions of amplitude software corporation  isocor corporation  and peerlogic  inc maintenance and support 
we recognized million in maintenance and support revenues during  as compared to million in maintenance and support revenues increased as a result of the completion of several acquisitions during and additional sales of software license products during and however  these increases were offset by the effects of our restructuring  as we identified certain non core products and services  of which all have either been exited or sold to third parties 
maintenance and support revenues related to these non core products and services was approximately million in  as compared to million in we anticipate non core service revenues will be insignificant during there were no maintenance and support revenues in maintenance and support revenues increased in as compared to as a result of the introduction of our software license product and maintenance and support service offerings related to messaging  directory and meta directory software products added through our acquisitions of amplitude software corporation  isocor corporation  and peerlogic  inc critical path s international operations accounted for approximately and of net revenues during and  respectively 
revenues from international operations were insignificant in this significant increase in international revenues from to related primarily to the acquisition of isocor corporation 
cost of net revenues software license 
cost of net software license revenues consists primarily of product media duplication  manuals and packaging materials  personnel and facilities costs  and third party royalties 
the overall decrease in from was directly related to the reduction in software license revenues between these two periods 
in  cost of net software license revenues increased significantly from levels as a result of the introduction of our software license product offerings related to messaging  directory and meta directory through our acquisitions of amplitude software corporation  isocor corporation  and peerlogic  inc hosted messaging 
cost of net hosted messaging revenues consists primarily of costs incurred in the delivery and support of messaging services  including depreciation of capital equipment used in network infrastructure  amortization of purchased technology  internet connection charges  accretion of acquisition related retention bonuses  personnel costs incurred in operations  and other direct and allocated indirect costs 
these costs remained flat in as compared to costs associated with hosted messaging increased significantly during the end of and the first quarter of as a result of adding new hosted messaging clusters to our data centers during  expanding the capacity of our hosting network to manage current customer requirements and future growth 
additionally  costs were incurred to add technology platforms for new service offerings 
as a result of these initiatives we acquired equipment and increased related support and professional services resources  causing depreciation and other costs to increase substantially in comparison with however  these increases were offset in the second half of by the effects of our restructuring initiative and the exiting of certain non core products and services 
as a result of the sale and divestiture of several non core services  the termination of employees through our restructuring initiative and the implementation of other cost cutting measures  we significantly reduced the cost of net hosted messaging revenues in professional services 
cost of professional services revenues consists primarily of personnel costs including custom engineering  installation and training services for both hosted and licensed solutions  and other direct and allocated indirect costs 
as a result of the acquisitions completed in  additional costs  primarily related to personnel costs  were incurred on professional services resources resulting in a increase in from there were no professional services revenues or related costs in maintenance and support 
cost of maintenance and support revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to the customer support functions for both hosted and licensed solutions  and other direct and allocated indirect costs 
as a result of the acquisitions completed in  additional costs  primarily related to personnel costs  were incurred on maintenance and support resources resulting in an increase in from there were no maintenance and support revenues or related costs in operations  customer support  and professional services staff decreased to employees at december  from employees at december   but increased from employees at december  headcount decreased in as a result of our strategic restructuring initiative and increased in as a result of our numerous acquisitions 
the following table presents selected operating expenses of critical path during  and historical amounts percentage of total net revenues period ended december  in thousands operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for sales and marketing personnel  advertising  public relations  other promotional costs  and  to a lesser extent  related overhead 
these costs decreased in from primarily due to the termination and resignation of several employees in our sales organization during the first quarter of  the termination of certain strategic marketing relationships related to non core services and other cost cutting measures in connection with our restructuring plan  primarily a reduction in headcount 
the significant increase in from related to marketing and promotional expenses  incentive compensation payments to sales personnel  and increases in compensation associated with additional headcount added through our ten acquisitions completed during and sales and marketing staff decreased to employees at december  from employees at december   but increased from employees at december  headcount decreased in as a result of our strategic restructuring initiative and increased in primarily as a result of our numerous acquisitions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for technical staff  payments to outside contractors  depreciation of capital equipment associated with research and development activities  and  to a lesser extent  related overhead 
these costs decreased in from as a result of our restructuring initiative  including the termination of several employees as well as certain contracts with outside consultants  and the implementation of other cost cutting measures 
the significant increase in from resulted primarily from increased compensation and other personnel costs from the additional headcount added through our ten acquisitions completed during and additionally  during and we increased headcount to continue to develop and enhance our portfolio of messaging  directory and security solutions 
research and development staff decreased to employees at december   from employees at december   but increased from employees at december  headcount decreased in as a result of our strategic restructuring initiative and increased in primarily as a result of our numerous acquisitions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel  fees for outside professional services  occupancy costs and  to a lesser extent  related overhead 
general and administrative expenses increased in from primarily as a result of increased compensation and other personnel costs from the additional headcount added through the acquisitions completed during additionally  we incurred higher fees for outside professional services in  in particular significantly higher legal and accounting fees related to the sec investigation and shareholder litigation which included legal fees reimbursed with respect to indemnification obligations to former officers and directors 
these increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by the termination of several employees in connection with our restructuring initiative and the implementation of other cost cutting measures

general and administrative staff decreased to employees at december   from employees at december   but increased from employees at december  headcount decreased in as a result of our strategic restructuring initiative and increased in primarily as a result of our numerous acquisitions 
management expects operating expenses to moderately increase during  primarily related to higher personnel costs associated with adding to the company s sales and marketing organization 
intangible assets amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with our and acquisitions  which were all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets  primarily including assembled workforce  customer base  and existing technology 
based on the types of identifiable intangibles acquired  during and amortization expense of million and million was allocated to the cost of net revenues and amortization expense of million and million was allocated to operating expenses  respectively 
all amortization expense was allocated to operating expenses in additionally  during and  we recorded charges of billion and million  respectively  related to the impairment of certain long lived assets  including intangible assets 
this was the primary cause of the significant reduction in amortization expense in from acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of isocor and peerlogic during  we recognized million representing the value attributable to acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these values were determined by estimating the future net cash flows of the acquired in process research and development over their respective estimated useful lives and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
at december   actual results were consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
all acquired in process research and development was expensed at the date of acquisition 
no amounts were recognized resulting from acquired in process research and development during or acquisition related retention bonuses in connection with the acquisitions of dotone  amplitude  xeti  faxnet  isocor  and docspace  we established various retention bonus programs that in the aggregate amounted to approximately million in incentives for certain former employees of these companies to encourage their continued employment with critical path 
based on the employees participating in these programs  during and expenses of  and million were allocated to cost of net revenues and expenses of million and million were allocated to operating expenses  respectively 
during  expenses of million were allocated to operating expenses related to these retention bonus programs 
the significant decrease in acquisition related retention bonus expense from to resulted from the completion  during  of all but one of these bonus programs 
the remaining program is expected to conclude in april stock based expenses stock based expenses totaled million  million  million in  and  respectively 
these amounts were comprised of stock based charges related to stock options granted and warrants issued 
stock based expenses related to stock options granted to employees  directors and consultants amounted to million  million and million during   and  respectively 
stock based expenses related to warrants issued to strategic partners and consultants amounted to million  million and million during   and  respectively 
the consecutive increases in stock based expense from through was primarily caused by the increase in stock option grants with exercise prices below fair market value in each of these successive fiscal years and issuance of warrants 
we expect that future changes in the trading price of our common stock at the end of each quarter  and if certain milestones are ever achieved  will cause additional substantial changes in the ultimate amount of the related stock based charges 
stock options 
we granted certain stock options with exercise prices below market value on the date of grant and issued certain common stock to employees  directors and advisors during and as a result  we recorded unearned compensation totaling million in and million in these amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the related options 
in march  in connection with an employee retention program  we granted options with exercise prices below market value on the date of grant to certain employees 
as a result of this program  we recorded unearned compensation totaling approximately million 
during certain of these unearned compensation balances were significantly reduced as a result of employee terminations throughout the year  affecting a reduction in future stock based expenses of million 
additionally  during  we incurred stock based charges of approximately million in connection with certain severance agreements for terminated employees and consulting arrangements 
these charges were included in operating expenses based on the functions of the related employees and consultants 
during  we incurred stock based charges of approximately million in connection with certain severance agreements for terminated employees 
approximately million of this charge was included in employee severance expense in connection with our plan to reduce worldwide headcount and the remaining million was included in stock based expenses 
during  we incurred a stock based charge of approximately million in connection with a severance agreement for a terminated employee 
this charge was included in cost of net revenues based on the employee s function 
warrants 
during and  we issued warrants to purchase shares of our preferred and common stock pursuant to certain strategic agreements 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements intangible assets and note impairment of long lived assets 
we believe that these warrants could have a significant current and potential future impact on our results of operations 
in january  we entered into an agreement with icq  inc  a subsidiary of aol time warner  pursuant to which we agreed to provide email hosting services that are integrated with icq s instant messaging service provided to icq s customers 
as part of the agreement  icq agreed to provide sub branded advertising for critical path in exchange for a warrant to purchase  shares of series b preferred stock  issuable upon attainment of each of five milestones 
as of april   all five milestones had been attained and the final revised aggregate fair value of all vested warrants was million  which is being amortized to advertising expense using the straight line method over four years

in october  the first of the six milestones had been attained and the final revised aggregate fair value of the vested warrants associated with the first milestone approximated million  which is being amortized to advertising expense using the straight line method over three years 
none of the remaining milestones are considered probable and as a result  the fair value of the warrants relating to the shares underlying the second through sixth milestones has not been recognized 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million bringing the adjusted fair value to approximately million  which will be amortized over the remaining benefit period 
in december  we entered into an agreement with worldsport network ltd  the sole and exclusive provider of internet solutions for the general association of international sports federations or gaisf and a majority of the international federations it recognizes

subsequent to the acquisition  we entered into discussions with telco to modify our relationship 
accordingly  we believe the vesting provisions of the proposed agreement will be modified to reflect the requirements of the new relationship 
as of december   none of the vesting milestones of the original agreement had been attained and none of the milestones are considered probable 
accordingly  no deferred compensation associated with the warrants has been recognized 
strategic restructuring and employee severance in july  we announced a plan to reduce our worldwide employee headcount by approximately employees or 
this employee reduction plan was executed with the intent to realize various synergies gained through the nine acquisitions we completed in and the first half of during  we recognized a charge for severance related costs totaling million  composed of million in cash charges and million in stock based compensation expense  which resulted from the acceleration of certain employee stock options in connection with the headcount reduction plan 
during  the company paid all amounts related to employee severance 
in april  we announced a three part strategic restructuring plan that involved reorganizing critical path s product and service offerings around a group of core communication solutions 
the three elements of the plan included i focusing on core communication solutions  ii workforce reduction  and iii facilities and operations consolidation 
additionally  we have implemented an aggressive expense management plan designed to further reduce operating costs while maintaining strong customer service for our core solutions 
we completed the restructuring plan in  including the divestiture of all of our non core products and services  a reduction in headcount  a reduction in facilities and the implementation of other cost cutting measures  resulting in a significant reduction in overall operating expenses 
as a result of these strategic initiatives  we anticipate that we will realize significant future annual cost savings 
the non core products and services comprised approximately and of total revenues in the years ended december  and these products and services will be an insignificant part of critical path s revenue stream going forward 
refocusing on core communications solutions 
we consider our core communication solutions to be our messaging  collaboration and identity management solutions  including mail  calendar  address book  file storage  secure delivery  directory and meta directory  and access services supporting wireline and wireless users 
restructuring charges associated with this refocusing of our products and services consisted primarily of contract termination fees  gains and losses related to asset sales and dispositions  and lease termination fees 
during  critical path sold or discontinued all of its non core products and services 
as a result of these transactions  a net gain of million was recorded for the year ended december  reduction of workforce  facility and other expenses 
critical path reduced its headcount from  at march  to employees at december   and consolidated its facilities from at december  to at december  charges related to the headcount reduction consisted primarily of the payment of severance and fringe benefits  and aggregated approximately million during included in this charge was approximately million related to the forgiveness of a note receivable to one of the company s former executives 
facilities and other expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with lease terminations  future lease payments and related fees  and aggregated approximately million during summary of year to date restructuring costs cash total noncash payments liabilities at charge charges receipts december  in millions workforce reduction facility and operations consolidation and other charges non core product and service sales and divestitures total net revenues related to our core communication solutions fiscal year ended december  in millions core net revenues software licensing hosted messaging professional services maintenance support total core revenues non core net revenues total net revenues impairment of long lived assets we recorded a billion impairment charge to reduce goodwill  other intangible assets and deferred costs associated with our icq and qwest relationships to their estimated fair values in the fourth quarter of in connection with the impairment analysis  the estimates of fair values were based upon the discounted estimated cash flows of critical path for the succeeding three years using a discount rate of and an estimated terminal value 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and an estimated terminal value  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rate was primarily based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
during and in connection with our strategic restructuring effort an additional assessment was performed on certain of our remaining long lived assets

liquidity and capital resources working capital declined to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to the use of cash to fund the company s net loss for  adjusted for non cash charges  and cash utilized to retire a significant portion of the company s convertible debt obligations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  the company primarily invests its excess cash in money market funds and other highly liquid securities with maturities of less than days with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes 
during  we also began investing a portion of our cash in high grade  low risk investments with an average maturity of three to twelve months 
as of december   these short term investments totaled approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during after having increased by million in the prior year 
the company used cash to fund operating activities of million during and million in  primarily due to our net loss  adjusted for non cash charges  as operating costs  primarily employee and employee related costs  significantly exceeded the related sales of our software products and services 
a more detailed discussion of our and operating results can be found in the results of operations section of this document 
also contributing to the use of cash in operating activities in were net cash outlays totaling million related to employee and facilities reduction costs and the divestiture of non core products and services  associated with the company s strategic restructuring activities 
in  the payment of million in acquisition related retention bonuses contributed to the net use of cash in operating activities 
during  we used cash in investing activities of million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for the acquisition of additional network infrastructure equipment for our data centers  for certain strategic investments and short term investments in high grade  low risk instruments 
in  we acquired the outstanding interest in our italian subsidiary  cp italia  for approximately million  and paid an investment banking fee associated with our isocor acquisition 
during  we used cash in investing activities totaling million primarily to purchase property  equipment and other capital assets and to fund certain strategic acquisitions and investments 
the significant outlay in capital expenditures during was primarily related to installation of additional network infrastructure equipment in our data centers  licenses of new software platforms  and purchases of furniture and equipment for new employees 
during  we completed our acquisitions of isocor  docspace  remarq  netmosphere  and peerlogic  and as a result  expended a significant amount of capital 
in addition  we made several strategic investments in private entities and an initial capital contribution to fund our interest in critical path pacific  inc these uses of cash were offset by the repayment of a previous advance made to a private company pursuant to a promissory note and certain of the employee notes 
during  the company used cash in financing activities of million as funds were used to retire a significant portion of the company s convertible debt and to payoff capital lease obligations 
these cash outlays were partially offset by proceeds raised in a financing transaction closed in the fourth quarter of detailed below and from the exercise of stock options 
during  the company retired million of face value of convertible debt  which resulted in an extraordinary gain on retirement of million  inclusive of million in write downs of related debt issuance costs 
the company used cash of million  as well as a significant portion of the proceeds raised from the issuance of preferred stock  in order to retire this debt 
see also note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements financing transaction 
as of december  and the total balance outstanding was million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed a financing transaction with a group of investors led by general atlantic partners  llc and its affiliates 
the financing transaction consisted of approximately million in gross cash proceeds and the retirement of million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes in the form of shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  and the issuance to general atlantic and its affiliates of warrants to purchase million shares of common stock 
the related proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the cash proceeds to the company  net of transaction costs  totaled million 
the related proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we received net cash proceeds from financing activities during of million due to the sale of million in convertible subordinated notes  as well as from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by a payment to retire a note payable assumed in the peerlogic acquisition and payments to retire principal on capital lease obligations 
our primary sources of capital have come from both debt and equity financings  that have been completed by critical path over the past three years 
revenues generated from the sale of our products and services may not increase to a level that exceeds our operating expenses or could fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in customer demand or acceptance of future products 
we also expect to experience increased operating expenses  including moderate increases in strategic areas  such as sales and marketing  and we anticipate that operating expenses and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash 
accordingly  our cash flow from operations may continue to be negatively impacted 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and anticipated cash from operations will be sufficient to maintain current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
additionally  we have no present understandings  commitments or agreements for any material acquisitions of  or investments in  other complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses  products and technologies  and may in the future utilize our cash resources or may require additional equity or debt financing to accomplish any acquisitions or investments 
currently  we are considering several alternatives to expand our presence in the asian markets and potentially other international markets 
these alternatives could increase liquidity through the infusion of investment capital by third party investors or decrease our liquidity as a result of critical path seeking to fund expansion into these markets 
such expansions might also cause an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
the contractual obligations and commitments table below sets forth our significant obligations and commitments as of december  fiscal year total and beyond in thousands contractual cash obligations convertible subordinated notes  including interest operating lease obligations capital lease obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations represent the critical path convertible subordinated notes due april represent certain contractual obligations related to licensed software  maintenance contracts and network infrastructure storage costs 
additional factors that may affect future operating results due to our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the nature of the messaging and directory infrastructure market  our future revenues are unpredictable  and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
we cannot accurately forecast our revenues as a result of our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the emerging nature of the internet messaging infrastructure market 
forecasting is further complicated by rapid changes in our business due to integration of acquisitions we completed in and  our recent strategic and operational restructuring  as well as significant fluctuations in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from an insignificant percentage in  to in and to in our revenues have in some quarters and could continue to fall short of expectations if we experience delays or cancellations of even a small number of orders 
we often offer volume based pricing  which may affect operating margins 
a number of factors are likely to cause fluctuations in operating results  including  but not limited to the demand for outsourced messaging services generally and the use of messaging and directory infrastructure products and services in particular  the demand for licensed solutions for messaging  directory  and other products  our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain customer satisfaction  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with industry expertise  particularly sales personnel  the ability to upgrade  develop and maintain our systems and infrastructure and to effectively respond to the rapid technology change of the messaging and directory infrastructure market  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of business and infrastructure  our ability to quickly handle and alleviate technical difficulties or system outages  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced services by competitors  and general economic and market conditions and their affect on our operations and that of our customers 
in addition to the factors set forth above  operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the extent to which we incur non cash charges associated with stock based arrangements with employees and non employees 
in particular  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial non cash charges associated with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees and the grant of warrants to customers  investors and other parties with which we have business relationships 
these grants of options and warrants also may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
although we have largely exited non core product lines  our operating results have been and could continue to be impacted by decisions to eliminate product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition or to sustain certain products and services at a minimum level where customer commitments prevent us from eliminating the offering altogether 
decisions to eliminate or limit any other offerings of a product or service would involve other factors affecting operational results including the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reductions in our workforce  facility consolidation or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of operating results are a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our common stock is likely to prove volatile and or decline 
we depend on strategic relationships as well as other sales channels and the loss of any key strategic relationships could harm our business and negatively affect our revenues 
we depend on strategic relationships to expand distribution channels and to undertake joint product development and marketing efforts 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon aggressively marketing our services through new and existing strategic relationships 
we depend on a broad acceptance of our software and outsourced messaging services on the part of potential resellers and partners and our acceptance as a supplier of outsourced messaging solutions 
we also depend on joint marketing and product development through strategic relationships to achieve further market acceptance and brand recognition 
our agreements with strategic partners typically do not restrict them from introducing competing services 
these agreements typically are for terms of one to three years  and automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement 
in addition  these agreements are terminable by our partners without cause  and some agreements are terminable by us  upon days notice 
most of the agreements also provide for the partial refund of fees paid or other monetary penalties in the event that our services fail to meet defined minimum performance standards 
distribution partners may choose not to renew existing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition to strategic relationships  we also depend on the ability of our customers to aggressively sell and market our services to their end users 
if we lose any strategic relationships  fail to renew these agreements or relationships  fail to fully exploit our relationships  or fail to develop new strategic relationships  our business and financial results will suffer 
the loss of any key strategic relationships would have an adverse impact on our current and future revenues 
we have experienced turnover of senior management and our current management team has been together for a limited time  which could harm our business and operations 
in the first quarter of  in response to the restatement of our financial results  we announced a series of changes in our management that included the departure of many senior executives 
in the second quarter of  we announced a series of additional changes in our management and board of directors that also included the departures of senior executives and board members 
a majority of the current senior executives of the company joined us in the second and third quarters of because of these recent changes and their recent recruitment  our management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully implement our strategy 
if our management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be severely impaired 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
it is possible this high turnover at our senior management levels may also continue for a variety of reasons 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current senior executive officers could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
we have a history of losses  expect continuing losses and may never achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit  including other comprehensive income  of approximately billion 
we have not achieved profitability in any period and expect to continue to incur net losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the foreseeable future 
we do expect that our operating expenses will continue to decrease as a result of our strategic and operational restructuring and other cost cutting efforts 
however  we will continue to spend resources on maintaining and strengthening our business  and this may  in the near term  have a negative effect on our operating results and our financial condition 
in past quarters  we have spent heavily on technology and infrastructure development 
we may continue to spend substantial financial and other resources to develop and introduce new end to end messaging and directory infrastructure solutions  and to improve our sales and marketing organizations  strategic relationships and operating infrastructure 
in addition  in future periods we will continue to incur significant non cash charges related to the ten acquisitions we completed in and and related stock based compensation 
we expect that our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  operations and customer support expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses could continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percent of revenues 
if revenues do not correspondingly increase  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
if we continue to incur net losses in future periods  we may not be able to retain employees  or fund investments in capital equipment  sales and marketing programs  and research and development to successfully compete against our competitors 
we may never obtain sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability in the future 
this may also  in turn  cause the price of our common stock to demonstrate volatility and or to decline 
if we fail to improve our sales and marketing results  we may be unable to grow our business affecting our operating results 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on our ability to successfully recruit  train and retain experienced and effective sales and marketing personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience 
the complexity and implementation of our messaging and directory infrastructure products and services require highly trained sales and marketing personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services 
current and prospective customers  in turn  must be able to educate their end users 
any delays or difficulties encountered in our staffing efforts would impair our ability to attract new customers and enhance our relationships with existing customers  and ultimately  grow revenues 
this would also adversely impact the timing and extent of our revenues 
because we have experienced turnover in our sales force and the majority of our current sales and marketing personnel have recently joined us and have limited experience working together  our sales and marketing organizations may not be able to compete successfully against the sales and marketing organizations of our competitors 
if we do not successfully operate and grow our sales and marketing activities  our business could suffer and the price of our common stock could decline 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenues and if we lose a major customer or are unable to attract new customers  revenues could decline 
we expect that sales of our services to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our current customers  and to attract new customers  in our target markets 
the loss of a major customer could harm our business 
our agreements with our customers typically have terms of one to three years often with automatic one year renewals and can be terminated without cause upon days notice 
in addition  a number of our technology industry customers have also suffered from falling revenue  job losses  restructuring and decreased technology spending in the recent economic downturn 
if our customers terminate their agreements for any reason before the end of the contract term  the loss of the customer could have an adverse impact on our current and future revenues 
also  if we are unable to enter into agreements with new customers  our business will not grow and we will not generate additional revenues 
if we are unable to successfully compete in our product market  our operating results could be harmed 
because we have a variety of messaging and directory infrastructure products and services  we encounter different competitors at each level of our products and services 
our competitors for corporate customers seeking outsourced hosted messaging solutions are email service providers  such as commtouch  easylink  usa 
net and application service providers who offer hosted exchange services 
our primary competitors for service providers seeking insourced or outsourced product based solutions are iplanet and openwave 
for secure delivery services  our competitors include tumbleweed for product based solutions and slamdunk for service based solutions 
in the enterprise ebusiness directory category  we compete primarily with iplanet  microsoft and novell  and our competitors in the meta directory market are iplanet  microsoft  novell and siemens 
we believe that competitive factors affecting the market for messaging and directory infrastructure solutions include breadth of platform features and functionality  ease of integration into customers existing systems  scalability  reliability and performance  and ease of expansion and upgrade  flexibility to enable customers to manage certain aspects of their systems internally and leverage outsourced services in other cases when resources  costs and time to market reasons favor an outsourced offering  and total cost of ownership and operation 
we believe competition will continue to be fierce and further increase as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
any delay in our development and delivery of new services or enhancement of existing services would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings  and provide time for new competitors to develop and market messaging and directory infrastructure products and services and solicit prospective customers within our target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
our sales cycle is lengthy and our results could be harmed by delays or cancellations in orders 
because we sell complex and sophisticated technology  our sales cycle can long and unpredictable often between two to twelve months 
because of the nature of our product and service offerings it can take many months of customer education and product evaluation before a purchase decision is made 
in addition  many factors can influence the decision to purchase our product and service offerings including budgetary restraints and decreases in capital expenditures  quarterly fluctuations in operating results of customers and potential customers  the emerging and evolving nature of the internet based services and wireless services markets 
furthermore  general global economic conditions  and a slowdown in technology spending in particular  have further lengthened and affected our sales cycle  leading to delays and postponements in purchasing decisions 
any delay or cancellation in sales of our products or services could cause our operating results to differ from those projected and cause our stock price to decline 
we may need to raise additional capital and to initiate other operational strategies that may dilute existing shareholders 
we believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations through december  however  additional capital may be required to continue operations and achieve profitability 
in addition  we may be required to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
additionally  we face a number of challenges in operating our business  including but not limited to the resources to maintain worldwide operations  our leveraged capital structure and significant contingent liabilities associated with litigation 
in the event that resolution of these or other operational matters involve issuance of stock or other derivative instruments  our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 
pending litigation could harm relationships with existing or potential strategic partners and customers  and divert management s attention either of which could harm our business 
we have had filed in recent years  a number of lawsuits against us  including securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation filed in february and august and february  and certain of our current and former officers and directors and some of our subsidiaries  as well as other lawsuits related to acquisitions  employee terminations and copyright infringement 
while these lawsuits vary greatly in the materiality of potential liability associated with them  the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation  whether material individually or in the aggregate 
in particular  this uncertainty could harm our relationships with existing customers  our ability to obtain new customers and our ability to operate certain aspects of our business 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in continued diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payments  individually or in the aggregate  could seriously harm our financial condition 
many of the complaints associated with these lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
while we maintain customary business insurance coverage  we have not set aside any financial reserves relating to potential damages associated with any of these lawsuits 
failure to complete the settlement of pending securities class action and shareholder derivative action could materially harm our business 
although the company has reached settlement agreements in connection with the securities class action pending in the us district court for the northern district of california  we cannot provide assurance that a final settlement shall be approved in accordance with the settlement agreement  or at all 
the approval of the definitive settlement agreements between the parties is subject to other factors  such as court review and approval  before the subject actions are dismissed 
in addition  the definitive settlement agreements entered into between the parties are also subject to notice to the putative class and of the shareholders of the company  as well as review and approval by the court 
there can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement 
if the settlement were not given final approval  it could have a number of materially detrimental effects on the company s financial condition and business 
should the court fail to approve the settlement  and the litigation continue  there can be no assurance that fees and expenses  and any ultimate resolution associated with such litigation  shall be within the coverage limits of our insurance and or our ability to pay such amounts 
although the terms of the settlement agreement are within the coverage limits of the company s directors and officers insurance  should the current agreement in principle fail to be approved by the court  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to conclude such litigation on terms that coincide with the coverage limits of our insurance and or ability to pay upon any final determination 
a failure to complete the settlement could also cast doubt as to the prospects of the company in the eyes of our customers  potential customers and investors  and cause the company s stock price to decline 
although concluded without penalty to the company  lingering effects of the recent sec investigation could harm our business 
in february  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued a formal order of investigation of us and certain current and former officers associated with us 
the investigation relates to non specified accounting matters  financial reports  other public disclosures and trading activity in our stock 
in february  the sec announced the conclusion of the investigation as to the company 
although the sec did not impose any penalties against the company  we consented without admitting or denying liability  to an administrative order that the company violated certain non fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and to a cease and desist order 
in addition  the sec and the department of justice charged two former employees of the company with various violations of the securities laws 
despite the conclusion of the investigation of the company  lingering concerns about the actions leading up to the restatement of financials for the third and fourth quarters of has nevertheless cast doubt on the future of the company in the eyes of customers and investors and could continue to harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate and or decline significantly 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market and if we fail to do so  the price and liquidity of our common stock may decline 
the nasdaq stock market has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the current requirements affecting us include i having net tangible assets of at least million and ii maintaining a minimum bid price per share of as of december  we were in compliance with all nasdaq national market listing requirements 
however  there were periods in the second and third quarters of when the closing bid price per share for our common stock was well below although our bid price has been above per share since november   if the bid price of our common stock price again slips below per share for more than days  our common stock may not remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
also effective november   we will also need to comply with the nasdaq national market s revised quantitative maintenance criteria including a new minimum requirement of million in stockholders equity 
the nasdaq national market s audit committee rules require that our audit committee be comprised of at least three independent members 
we believe that we currently comply with this requirement 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the quantitative maintenance criteria or any of the nasdaq national market s rules in the future 
if we fail to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq national market and must move to a market with less liquidity  our financial condition could be harmed and our stock price would likely decline 
if we are delisted  it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of  and the liquidity of the trading market for  our common stock 
our stock price has demonstrated volatility during recent quarters and continued volatility in the stock market may cause further fluctuations and or decline in our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to experience volatility and wide fluctuations 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from on october  to on november   and the closing sale price of our common stock on december  was 
our stock price may further fluctuate or decline in response to any number of factors and events  such as announcements related to litigation  technological innovations  strategic and sales relationships  new product and service offerings by us or our competitors  changes in senior management  changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets and overall market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  particularly with respect to technology stocks  has experienced extreme volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent quarters 
this volatility and decline has affected many companies  including our company  irrespective of the specific operating performance of such companies 
these broad market influences and fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  and our ability to remain listed on the nasdaq national market  regardless of our operating performance or other factors 
limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may harm our business 
our liability insurance for actions taken by officers and directors during the period from march to march  the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our current and former executive officers are alleged to have occurred  provides only limited liability protection 
if these policies do not adequately cover our expenses related to those lawsuits  our business and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
our director and officer liability insurance  that was in place through march  and our current insurance that was renewed through march  contain similar provisions 
under california law  in connection with our charter documents and indemnification agreements we entered into with our executive officers and directors  we must indemnify our current and former officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of legal proceedings 
the company has made payments in connection with the indemnification of officers and directors in connection with currently pending lawsuits and has reserved for estimated future amounts to be paid in connection with legal expenses and others costs of defense of pending lawsuits 
we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which may negatively affect our ability to develop new services or retain and attract customers 
the loss of the services of key personnel could harm our business results 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales and marketing  operational  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these people is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to do so  we may be unable to develop new services or continue to provide a high level of customer service  which could result in the loss of customers and revenues 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current key personnel could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
our failure to carefully manage expenses and growth could cause our operating results to suffer 
in the past  our management of operational expenses and the growth of our business have contributed to our history of losses 
in addition  the expansion of our operations placed a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage any future growth  we may need to improve or replace our existing operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any failure to properly manage these systems and procedural transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers  and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of our business plan 
we will also need to hire additional personnel including sales personnel 
our management may not be able to hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
in addition  our management may not be able to successfully identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
if we cannot manage growth and expenses effectively  our business and operating results could suffer 
if we are not successful in finalizing our strategic plan  including the exit of certain non core products and services  our business could be negatively impacted 
in the first quarter of  we developed a strategic plan that involved reorganizing our product and service offerings around a group of core products deemed most imperative to our ability to serve the messaging and directory infrastructure market 
in the second and third quarters of  implementation of the plan occurred and  accordingly  products and services determined to be non core to our strategy were strategically exited 
our strategic plan also included initiatives aimed at reducing operating costs through headcount reduction and consolidation of approximately two thirds of our office space and related contracts and leases  all in keeping with our increased focus on core messaging products and services 
during the fourth quarter of we incurred some addition charges in connection previously announced reductions in force and were able to finalize the consolidation of additional facilities and related contracts and expenses associated with those facilities 
the non core products and services comprised approximately of total revenues in the first quarter of  approximately of total revenues in the second quarter of  approximately of total revenues in the third quarter of  and of total revenues in the fourth quarter of we expect that any further charges associated with the strategic restructuring will be minimal in future quarters 
we may face continued technical  operational and strategic challenges preventing us from successfully continuing the integration or divestiture of acquired businesses 
acquisitions involve risks related to the integration and management of acquired technology  operations and personnel 
in addition  in connection with our strategic restructuring  the company elected to divest or discontinue many of the acquired businesses 
both the integration and divestiture of acquired businesses have been and will continue to be complex  time consuming and expensive processes  which may disrupt and distract our management from its core business 
with respect to integration  we must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices to be successful 
in particular  we are currently evaluating  upgrading or replacing our financial information systems and establishing uniformity among the systems of the acquired businesses 
with divestitures  the timing and transition of those businesses and their customers to other entities has required and will continue to require resources from our legal  finance and corporate development teams as well as expenses associated with the conclusion of those transactions 
consequently  we may not be successful or efficient in integrating or divesting acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenues and benefit and or cost reductions 
we also cannot guarantee that these acquisitions will result in sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or expenses related to  these acquisitions or that any synergies will be realized 
in addition  if we are not successful in divesting non core acquired businesses  we will incur costs associated with the cessation of operations or wind up of acquired businesses 
in either event  we will likely further incur significant expenses as well as non cash charges to write off acquired assets  which could seriously harm our financial condition and operating results 
further  due in part to the significant underperformance of some of our acquisitions relative to expectations  we have reviewed the products and services we sell to customers  the locations in which we operate and the manner in which we go to market with our core product and service offerings 
as a result of this review  in  we eliminated certain acquired product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition or to sustain certain products and services at a minimum level where customer commitments prevent us from eliminating the offering altogether 
such decisions to eliminate or limit our offering of an acquired product or service involved and could continue to include the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reduction in workforce  facility consolidation  and or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we currently license many third party technologies and may need to license further technologies and we face risks in doing so that could cause our operating results to suffer 
we intend to continue to license certain technologies from third parties and incorporate such technologies into our products and services  including web server technology  virus and anti spam solutions and encryption technology 
the market is evolving and we may need to license additional technologies to remain competitive 
we may not be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to the extent we cannot license needed technologies or solutions  we may have to devote company resources to the development of such technologies which could materially harm our business and operations 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services 
these third party in licenses may expose us to increased risks  including risks related to the integration of new technology  potential patent and copyright infringement issues  the diversion of resources from the development of proprietary technology  and an inability to generate revenues from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
in addition  an inability to obtain needed licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
any delays in services or integration problems could cause our business and operating results to suffer 
if our system security is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
a fundamental requirement for online communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
if these attempts are successful  customers confidential information  including customers profiles  passwords  financial account information  credit card numbers or other personal information could be breached 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and a breach could harm our reputation 
we rely on encryption technology licensed from third parties 
although we have implemented network security measures  our servers remain vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
failure to prevent security breaches may harm our business and operating results 
changes in the regulatory environment for the operation of our business or those of our customers could pose risks 
few laws currently apply directly to activity on the internet and the messaging business  however new laws are proposed and other laws made applicable to internet communications every year 
in particular  the company faces risks associated with privacy  confidentiality of user data and communications  consumer protection  taxation  content  copyright  trade secrets  trademarks  antitrust  defamation and other legal issues 
in particular  legal concerns with respect to communication of confidential data have affected our financial services and health care customers due to newly enacted federal legislation 
the growth of the industry and the proliferation of internet based messaging devices and services may prompt further legislative attention to our industry and thus invite more regulatory control of our business 
the imposition of more stringent protections and or new regulations and application of laws to our business could burden our company and those with which we do business 
further  the adoption of additional laws and regulations could limit the growth of our business and that of our business partners and customers 
any decreased generalized demand for our service or the loss of or decrease in business by a key partner due to regulation or the expense of compliance with any regulation  could either increase the costs associated with our business or affect revenue  either of which could harm our financial condition or operating results 
certain of our service offerings include operations subject to the digital millenium copyright act of the company has expended resources and implemented processes and controls in order to remain in compliance with dmca but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient and or new legislation and case law will not affect the operation of certain services 
in addition  the applicability of laws and regulations directly applicable to the businesses of our customers  particularly customers in the fields of banking and health care  will continue to affect us 
the security of information about our customers end users continues to be an area where a variety of laws and regulations with respect to privacy and confidentiality are enacted 
as our customers implement the protections and prohibitions with respect to the transmission of end user data  our customers will look to us to assist them in remaining in compliance with this evolving area of regulation 
in particular the gramm leach blilely act contains restrictions with respect to the use and protection of banking records for end users whose information may pass through our system 
unknown software defects could disrupt our services and harm our business and reputation 
our software products are inherently complex 
additionally  our service offerings depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we may not discover software defects in our products or that affect new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although we have not experienced any material software defects to date  it is possible that  despite testing  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage our reputation or increase service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert development resources  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
we may have liability for internet content and we may not have adequate liability insurance 
as a provider of messaging and directory services  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted via our services 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by our users  and we could be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  some foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
in some instances  we may be subject to criminal liability in connection with internet content transmission 
although we carry general liability and umbrella liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
there is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims  if successfully asserted against us  could exceed the total of our coverage limits 
there also is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims asserted against us may not qualify for coverage under our insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained within these policies 
should either of these risks occur  capital contributed by our shareholders might need to be used to settle claims 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our reputation and business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could reduce our ability to provide messaging services and could harm our business reputation 
our customers have  in the past  experienced some interruptions in our messaging service 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions are due to hardware failures  unsolicited bulk email  or spam  attacks and operating system failures 
our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of systems or networks or reduce our ability to provide email services 
we expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to continue to happen  our business and reputation could suffer dramatically 
we have entered into messaging agreements with some customers that require minimum performance standards  including standards regarding the availability and response time of messaging services 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and we could be subject to contractual monetary penalties 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights  and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  our ability to compete and generate revenue could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  and patents to establish and protect our proprietary rights  which we view as critical to our success 
our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected 
we seek to protect our source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we license our software pursuant to agreements that impose certain restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe or copy portions of our services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  which could harm our competitive position and market share 
we also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
in addition  we have several patents pending in the united states and may seek additional patents in the future 
however  the status of united states patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we do not know if our patent applications or any of our future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents we have received or will receive will be challenged or invalidated 
our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use  and end user license provisions in our contracts that protect us against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
additionally  although no claims of alleged patent infringement are currently pending  we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents that may relate to our products 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our software products 
we may not be able to respond to the rapid technological change of the messaging and directory infrastructure industry 
the messaging directory infrastructure industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing services  proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing email and messaging services and to develop new services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers 
if we do not properly identify the feature preferences of prospective customers  or if we fail to deliver email features that meet the standards of these customers  our ability to market our service successfully and to increase revenues could be impaired 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we may not be able to keep pace with the latest technological developments 
we may also be unable to use new technologies effectively or adapt services to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
our reserves may be insufficient to cover bills we are unable to collect 
we assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business 
conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for products or services we have already provided them 
for example  if the current economic conditions continue to decline or if new or unanticipated government regulations are enacted which affect our customers  they may be unable to pay their bills 
in the past  we have experienced significant collection delays from certain customers  and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future 
in particular  some of our customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in particular 
although we have established reserves that we believe are sufficient to cover losses due to delays in or inability to pay  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover our losses 
if losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves  it could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the expansion of our international operations  our business could suffer 
we derived of our revenues from international sales in the fiscal year ended december  and of our revenues from international sales in we intend to continue to operate in international markets and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
if revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our business  financial condition and operating results will suffer 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete or operate effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  differing technology standards  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  political and economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
any of these factors could harm our international operations and  consequently  our business and consolidated operating results 
specifically  failure to successfully manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in key international markets 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and any significance disruption in california s energy supply could harm our operations and increase our expenses 
during and california experienced a serious energy crisis that could have and may in the future disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply or the power supply of any of our customers  we  or our customers  may be temporarily unable to operate 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations could delay the development of or interfere with the sales of our products 
future interruptions could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
any interruption in the ability of our customers to continue their operations  could harm their business  and ultimately could also harm our business if they were to terminate or fail to renew contracts 
we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of blackouts  and any losses or damages we incur could harm our business 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in by the california government and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have caused power prices to increase 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase  as our headquarters and many employees are based in california 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior shareholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of our common stock  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at a meeting 
in march  we adopted a shareholder rights plan or poison pill 
this plan could cause the acquisition of our company by a party not approved by our board of directors to be prohibitively expensive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company s short term investments consisted of available for sale securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million 
these investments are primarily comprised of low risk government securities and corporate bonds 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements investments 
these securities are subject to equity price risk 
the company has not attempted to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these equity securities 
at december  the company carried long term investments totaling million  comprised of million in investments in marketable securities and million in investments in non marketable securities 
these securities represent strategic equity investments in corporate partners  certain of which are publicly traded and marketable and certain of which are privately held 
for each decline in market value of its available for sale equity securities from december   the company s marketable securities would be insignificantly impacted 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
the company s long term obligations consist of the company s million five year  convertible subordinated notes due april  and certain fixed rate capital leases 
accordingly  an immediate change in interest rates would not affect the company s long term obligations or the company s results of operations 
a significant portion of our international operations has a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities of these operations 
fluctuations in exchange rates may harm our results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted with any certainty  however our exposure to foreign currency rate risk is primarily associated with fluctuations in the euro  italian lire and irish punt 
we realized a net loss on foreign exchange equal to  during and a net gain of  in to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
