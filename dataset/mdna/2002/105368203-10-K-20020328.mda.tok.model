critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to bad debts  capitalization of costs  contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of it financial statements revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of certain properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
the company expenses routine repair and maintenance expenditures 
real estate ventures the company accounts for its non controlling interests in real estate ventures using the equity method 
these investments  initially recorded at cost  are subsequently adjusted for the company s net equity in the venture s income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
valuation of long lived assets management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of any impairment loss will be based on the fair value of the asset  determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts where it has been determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  the company uses its judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that the company expects to collect 
these reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
marketable securities the company accounts for its investments in equity securities according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires securities classified as available for sale to be stated at fair value 
adjustments to fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in beneficiaries equity 
the company records an investment impairment charge when an investment has experienced a decline in value that management believes to be other than temporary 
deferred costs the company incurs direct costs related to the financing and leasing of the properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company measures every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and records them in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period 
the company formally assesses  both at inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of cash flows of the hedged item 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  the company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts 
as of december   the maximum length of time which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is through june there was no gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings during as a result of the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge due to the probability of the original forecasted transaction not occurring 
legal contingencies the company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters  including disputes with tenants and disputes arising out of agreements to purchase or sell properties 
given the nature of the company s business activities  these lawsuits are considered to be routine to the conduct of its business 
the result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted  because of the very nature of litigation  the litigation process and its adversarial nature  and the jury system 
results of operations in  the operating partnership held a economic interest in brandywine realty services corporation the management company through its ownership of of the management company s non voting preferred stock and of its voting common stock

funds from operations management considers funds from operations ffo as one measure of reit performance 
ffo is calculated as net income loss adjusted for depreciation expense attributable to real property  amortization expense attributable to capitalized leasing costs  gains losses on sales of land interests  and extraordinary items and comparable adjustments for real estate ventures accounted for using the equity method 
management believes that ffo is a useful disclosure in the real estate industry  however  the company s disclosure may not be comparable to other reits 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the following table summarizes ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except share data income before gains on sale  minority interest and extraordinary   add deduct depreciation attributable to real property   attributable to real estate ventures   amortization attributable to leasing costs   gain on sale of land interests gain included in equity in income of real estate ventures funds from operations before minority interest   weighted average common shares including common share equivalents and operating partnership units   inflation a majority of the company s leases provide for escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measure 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases 
interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects the company s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
the company s financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages and million in variable rate mortgage notes  and million borrowed under its credit facility 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the company has entered into interest rate swap and rate cap agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate debt 
at december   the company had three interest rate swap agreements for notional principal amounts aggregating million 
the swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on million of credit facility borrowings at  million at and million at until september in october  the company entered into three additional interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on million of credit facility borrowings at and on million at from september to june the interest rate cap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on two variable rate mortgages 
one rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a notional value of million at until maturity in april the second interest rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a notional value of million at until july the impact of the cap agreements is recorded as a component of interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous move in interest rates from their actual levels at december  with all other variables held constant 
as of december   a increase in actual interest rates would result in a decrease in beneficiaries equity of million and a decrease in actual interest rates would result in an increase in beneficiaries equity of million 
based on the company s variable rate debt as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest expense per year and a decrease would reduce interest expense by million per year
