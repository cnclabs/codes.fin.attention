overview in the past fiscal year  we were engaged in two business segments diagnostic products develops  manufactures and markets our cholestech ldx system the ldx system which performs alternate site diagnostic testing to assist in assessing for risk of heart disease  diabetes and certain liver diseases and in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
wellcheck conducts consumer testing within the united states of america that assesses the risk of heart disease and other diseases and assists in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
through its test event activity management software teams  wellcheck collects test results and other patient data in compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and aggregates that data for testing event sponsors use in marketing programs 
in fiscal  we engaged in a third business segment  wellcheck 
com  our interactive internet site 
the company determined that starting in fiscal  wellcheck and wellcheck 
com would be operated and managed as one segment 
all operating results present the combined results for wellcheck and wellcheck 
com as a single segment  and as a result  all prior year activity has been combined to reflect this change 
diagnostic products currently manufactures and markets the ldx system  including the ldx analyzer and a variety of single use test cassettes  in the united states of america  europe  asia and south america 
the ldx system allows healthcare providers to perform individual tests or combinations of tests with a single drop of blood from a fingerstick within five minutes 
our current products measure and monitor 
table of contents blood cholesterol  related lipids  glucose and liver enzymes  and are used to test patients at risk of or suffering from heart disease  diabetes and liver disease 
wellcheck  funded by third party sponsors  uses the ldx system to provide health screenings for leading pharmaceutical  consumer product and corporate wellness clients throughout the nation in convenient consumer venues 
these testing service activities result in additional sales of test cassettes manufactured by our diagnostic products business 
wellcheck s professionals provide high quality services and offer test event expertise to both event sponsors and consumers 
as part of our testing services  we utilize our proprietary teams technology which automates registration  data acquisition and information management at promotional  corporate wellness and other consumer testing events and provides consumers with a personalized risk assessment for heart disease 
wellcheck has developed its technology with the input from a variety of authorities on health information privacy practices 
teams incorporates procedures that meet state and federal legislation  such as hipaa  concerning the use of protected health information 
substantially all of wellcheck s revenue is derived from promotional programs with major pharmaceutical companies marketing lipid lowering statin drugs 
we believe an opportunity exists to further expand our testing services business in the promotional  corporate wellness and other convenient venues which broaden consumer access to testing while assisting consumer product companies  such as pharmaceutical companies  in customer acquisition 
our goal is to expand our testing services  thereby increasing sales of test cassettes manufactured by our diagnostic products business 
our ongoing investment relating to wellcheck may result in continuing negative cash flows for this recently acquired business unit 
we intend to continue to make significant expenditures in sales  marketing  development and teams to develop this business 
the amount and timing of expenditures will have an impact on our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flows 
as wellcheck s third party sponsorships evolve  the number of testing events and tests performed will vary and revenue will fluctuate 
in an effort to diversify our customer base  we have established relationships with various third party sponsors for the upcoming fiscal year  but the exact timing and level of these sponsorships have not yet been finalized 
additionally  wellcheck s revenue will be influenced by seasonality 
during the last two months of the calendar year  promotional testing decreases significantly as sponsors budgets become fully spent 
in addition  people typically pursue other interests and are less focused on chronic health issues during this time period

interest and other income  net 
interest income reflects income from the investment of cash balances and marketable securities  net of expenses 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of reduced yields on cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with higher bank service fees 
income taxes 
we have significant net operating loss nols and tax credit carryforwards 
we recorded no provision for income taxes in fiscal due to the use of the net operating loss 
the  provision for income taxes in fiscal represented the estimated state income taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards 
management expects to use nols and other tax carryforward amounts to the extent taxable income is earned in fiscal and beyond 
as of march   we had nol carryforwards of million available to reduce future taxable income for federal income tax purposes  however  we have fully consumed our nol carryforwards for california purposes 
additionally  we had research and development and other tax credit carryforwards available to reduce income taxes for federal income tax purposes of million and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards available to reduce income taxes for state income tax purposes of  we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes 
therefore  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nols and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at march  over the course of the next year  we will review our position on our 
table of contents valuation allowance 
if we continue to remain profitable during the coming fiscal year  there is a possibility that we will release our valuation allowance 
prior to the release of the valuation allowance  to the extent that we are profitable  our effective tax rate should continue to be substantially less than the applicable statutory rates 
following the release of our valuation allowance  our effective tax rate will approximate the applicable statutory rates 
as a result of a change in ownership for tax purposes which occurred in fiscal  there is an annual limitation of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes on the combined use of approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and the use of approximately  of federal and state tax credit carryforwards

in the first quarter of fiscal  the adjustment to cost of revenue was  
table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred to our customers  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts to customers  returns or other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and returns 
we recognize revenue associated with testing services upon completion of the services to be performed under contract when all obligations are satisfied  and collection is reasonably assured 
if all conditions to recognize revenue are not met  we are required to defer revenue recognition 
in the event that the actual operating environment changes  our operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected 
we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of historical sales  forecasted sales  product expiration and current inventory levels 
during fiscal   was charged to cost of revenue for excess  obsolete and unusable inventory 
if the market value of our products decline  the demand for our products decline or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we maintain a warranty allowance for the estimated amount of repairs or replacement cost of all products which are found to be defective 
provisions for warranty are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded 
the amount of allowance is based upon analyses of historical repairs and replacements 
should the product defect rate increase  the need for additional allowance will increase and could adversely affect our results of operations 
we provide for income taxes based on estimated federal and state alternative minimum taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards 
we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes  therefore  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nols and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax asset was required at march  over the course of the next year  we will continue to review our position with respect to the necessity of the full valuation 
table of contents allowance 
if we continue to remain profitable during the coming fiscal year and determine that realization of all or a portion of the nols is likely  then we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 
if the federal or state governments change the corporate income tax laws  our ability to use nols and tax credits could be reduced  adversely affecting our operating results 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and comply with the disclosure provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation expense included in net income loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if we were to include the cost of stock based employee compensation in the financial statements  our operating results would decline based on the fair value of the stock based employee compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
sfas no 
supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller eitf  which addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including both a reseller of the vendor s products and an entity that purchases the vendor s products from a reseller 
eitf also codifies and reconciles related guidance issued by the eitf  including eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf outlines the presumption that consideration given by a vendor to a customer  a reseller or a customer of a reseller is to be treated as a deduction from revenue 
treatment of such payments as an expense would only be appropriate if two conditions are met i the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration paid that is sufficiently separable from the sale such that the vendor could have entered into an exchange transaction with a party other than the purchaser or its products in order to receive that benefit  and ii the vendor can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt eitf no 
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results we have limited experience in the testing services business  and if this business is not successful  we may be harmed our wellcheck testing services business  which we acquired in january  is still relatively new to us and to our management team 
this will make it more difficult for us to successfully develop this 
table of contents business 
also  we will be devoting significant resources to developing this business 
if we are not successful in developing this business  our diagnostic products business may be harmed 
even if we are successful at developing this business  the demands of attempting to grow this business may prevent us from devoting significant time and attention to our traditional diagnostic products business  and that business may decline 
our operating results may suffer if we are unable to manage geographically diverse operations we have managed and operated our traditional business almost exclusively from our hayward  california headquarters 
our wellcheck business requires us to operate in multiple geographically dispersed locations and adapt our management and financial systems and controls to this geographically dispersed business 
if we cannot successfully manage our geographic expansion  the testing services business may not succeed and we may not recover our investment in the testing services business 
as a result  our business may suffer 
our testing services business requires significant management attention and financial resources to develop and if this business is not successful  our business may be harmed the continued development of our testing services business and our proprietary teams software will require significant management attention and financial resources 
these expenditures are likely to materially affect our operating results as a whole 
we may need to seek additional capital to help fund these expenses 
the required additional capital may be unavailable to us at favorable or acceptable terms when required  or at all 
if we cannot obtain required additional capital  we may have to change our business strategy  which would be disruptive to our business 
if we raise additional capital through borrowings  the terms of such borrowings may impose limitations on how our management may operate the business in the future 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity  this may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
also  equity issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to expand third party sponsorship of our testing services business  or our existing sponsorship is eliminated or reduced  our revenue will be greatly reduced and our testing services business will fail wellcheck derives the majority of its revenue from third parties using our testing services to promote their products 
for our testing services business to succeed  we must increase and diversify the current number of third party relationships to grow our business 
we are currently in discussions with potential third party sponsors to establish relationships with wellcheck and have signed contracts with several new third party sponsors in our continuing efforts to diversify our revenue base 
if existing sponsors decline to participate in the future or reduce the amount of their sponsorship  our revenue will be greatly reduced and our testing services business will fail 
if we fail to integrate any future acquisitions  our business will be harmed we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions 
these acquisitions could be very costly  could result in dilution to existing investors and could result in integration problems that harm our business as a whole 
any acquisition could result in expending significant amounts of cash  issuing potentially dilutive equity securities or incurring debt or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business 
any of these acquisition financing approaches could materially harm our operating results and business 
acquisitions may also result 
table of contents in difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products  services and personnel of the acquired company or business or in achieving the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated 
these difficulties could result in additional expenses  diversion of management attention and an inability to respond quickly to market issues 
any of these results could harm us financially 
our ldx system has not yet achieved broad market acceptance in all of our target markets and if broad market acceptance does not occur  our operating results will be harmed our ldx system  including the ldx analyzer and single use test cassettes  will continue to account for substantially all of the revenue of our diagnostics products business for the foreseeable future 
if this revenue does not grow  our overall business will be severely harmed 
for us to increase revenue  sustain profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations  the ldx system must continue to gain broader market acceptance among healthcare providers  particularly physician office laboratories 
we have made only limited sales to physician office laboratories to date relative to the size of the available markets 
factors that could prevent broad market acceptance of the ldx system include low levels of awareness of the availability of our technology in both the physician and other customer groups  the ldx system s accuracy  ease of use  rapid test time  reliability and cost effectiveness compared to other testing alternatives  many managed care organizations have contracts with laboratories  which require participating or employed physicians to send patient specimens to contracted laboratories  physicians are under growing pressure by medicare and other third party payors to limit their testing to medically necessary tests  and decrease in the amount of reimbursement for performing tests on the ldx system 
if we do not achieve broader market acceptance  our diagnostic products business will not grow 
even if we are successful in continuing to place ldx analyzers at physician office laboratories and other near patient testing sites  there can be no assurance that placement of ldx analyzers will result in sustained demand for our single use test cassettes 
we are relying in significant part on income from the core diagnostic product business to finance our strategic expansion 
if the diagnostic products business does not grow  the testing services business will not succeed 
these results would cause severe financial harm to us 
as a result of these many hurdles to achieving broad market acceptance for the ldx system  demand for the ldx system may not be sufficient to sustain revenue and profits from operations 
because the ldx system currently contributes the vast majority of our revenue  we could be required to cease operations if the ldx system does not achieve and maintain a significant level of market acceptance 
our business has experienced a history of operating losses and fluctuating operating results  which may cause our stock price to fall historically  we have experienced significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our first profitable quarter was the third quarter of fiscal  and our first profitable year was fiscal we recorded a net 
table of contents loss of million for fiscal and a net profit of million for fiscal our profitability and positive cash flows from operations in the future will require broadening market acceptance of our existing product offerings  successfully developing  introducing and marketing additional test cassettes or other products for our diagnostic products business  and successfully developing our testing services business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis  which could cause our stock price to decline our revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenues  operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter the timing and amount of expenditures required for the continued development of our testing services business  the timing and level of market acceptance of the ldx system  the timing of the introduction and availability of new tests  the timing and level of expenditures associated with research and development activities  the timing and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities and overall operations  variations in manufacturing efficiencies  the timing and establishment of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements  changes in demand for our products based on changes in third party reimbursement  competition  changes in government regulation and other factors  the timing of significant orders from  and shipments to  customers  product pricing and discounts  the timing and level of third party sponsorship of our testing services business  seasonality of our testing business  variations in the mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly demand for our products may cause our manufacturing operations to fluctuate in volume  increase uncertainty in operational planning and or affect cash flows from operations 
many of our expenses are committed to in advance  based on our expectations of future business needs 
these costs are largely fixed in the short term 
as a result  when business levels do not meet expectations  our fixed costs will not be recovered and we will experience losses 
this situation is likely to result in the future because of the variability and unpredictability of our 
table of contents revenue 
this also means that our results will likely not meet the expectations of public market security analysts or investors at one time or another  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly 
if we do not successfully develop  introduce and market new tests  our business will be harmed most of our revenue comes from our diagnostics products business 
we anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future 
we also rely on revenue from the diagnostics products business to fund the development of our testing services business 
we believe our diagnostic products business will not grow significantly if we do not develop new tests to use with the ldx system 
if new tests are not developed and accepted in the market  our business will not grow significantly and will be harmed 
developing new tests involves many significant problems and risks  including research and development is a very expensive process  research and development takes a very long time to result in a marketable product  significant costs including diversion of resources may be incurred in development before knowing if the development will result in a test that is commercially viable  a new test will not be successful unless it is effectively marketed to its target market  the manufacturing process for a new test must be reliable  cost efficient and high volume and must be developed and implemented in a timely manner to produce the test for sale  new tests must meet a significant market need to be successful  and new tests must obtain proper regulatory approvals to be marketed 
we could experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new tests 
for example  regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
we have experienced difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for tests in the past 
because the fda s evaluation of applications for clia waived status is not based on precisely defined  objectively measurable criteria  we cannot predict the likelihood of obtaining waived status for future products 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes we manufacture all of the single use test cassettes that are used with the ldx analyzer 
the manufacture of single use test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process that is sensitive to a wide variety of factors 
we have  in the past  experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments 
if we do not maintain acceptable manufacturing yields of test cassettes or experience product shipment delays  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of test cassettes because of raw materials variations or impurities  manufacturing process variances and impurities  and decreased manufacturing equipment performance 

table of contents our ldx and cassette manufacturing lines would be costly and time consuming to repair or replace if their operation were interrupted 
the interruption of our manufacturing operations or the loss of associates dedicated to the manufacturing facility could severely harm our business 
the risks involving our manufacturing lines include as our production levels have increased  we have been required to use our machinery more hours per day and the down time resulting from equipment failure has increased  the custom nature of much of our manufacturing equipment increases the time required to remedy equipment failures and replace equipment  we have a limited number of associates dedicated to the operation and maintenance of our manufacturing equipment  the loss of whom could impact our ability to effectively operate and service such equipment  and we manufacture all cassettes at our hayward  california manufacturing facility  so manufacturing operations are at risk to interruption from earthquake  fire  power outages or other events affecting this one location 
we are currently in the process of scaling up our recently installed third manufacturing line to full production capability 
our failure to increase production levels and operate this line at full production capability for an extended period would impact our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity 
our operating results may suffer if we do not reduce our manufacturing costs we believe we will be required to reduce manufacturing costs for new and existing test cassettes to achieve sustained profitability 
we currently operate three manufacturing lines for dry chemistry cassettes 
we have recently installed our third manufacturing line  and we are currently in the process of scaling it up to full production capability 
the complexity and custom nature of our manufacturing process increases the amount of time and money required to add an additional manufacturing line 
despite our efforts  the new manufacturing line may not operate at full production volume for a substantial period of time 
also  we may need to implement additional cassette manufacturing cost reduction programs 
failure to fully integrate the new dry chemistry manufacturing line could prevent us from satisfying customer orders in a timely manner  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
failure to fully integrate the new line could also prevent us from reducing manufacturing costs for dry chemistry tests  and prevent us from achieving sustained profitability 
we depend on single source suppliers for inputs to our manufacturing process and failure of our suppliers to provide supplies to us could harm our business we currently depend on single source vendors to provide certain subassemblies  components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
any supply interruption in a single source subassembly  component or raw material could restrict our ability to manufacture products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be successful in qualifying additional sources of supply on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain a usable alternative source could prevent us from manufacturing our products  resulting in inability to fill orders  customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
this would likely severely harm our business 
in addition  an uncorrected impurity or supplier s variation in a raw material  either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process  could interfere with our 
table of contents ability to manufacture products 
because we are a small customer of many of our suppliers and we purchase their subassemblies  components and materials with purchase orders instead of long term commitments  our suppliers may not devote adequate resources to supplying our needs 
any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any subassemblies  components or raw materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could severely harm our business 
if we are successful in growing sales  our business will be harmed if we cannot effectively manage the operational and management challenges of growth if we are successful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance for the ldx system and our testing business  we will be required to expand our operations  particularly in the areas of sales  marketing and manufacturing 
as we expand our operations  this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  we will be required to implement and improve our information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to implement and improve operational  financial and management systems or to manage our work force as required by future growth  if any  could harm our business and prevent us from improving our financial condition as a result of increased sales 
we depend on distributors to sell our products and will need to maintain and expand these existing relationships to increase revenue and achieve sustained profitability  we will have to maintain and expand our existing distribution relationships and develop new distribution relationships 
we are dependent on such distributors to assist us in promoting market acceptance of the ldx system 
if we do not maintain and expand these relationships  our sales will not grow and our business will be greatly harmed 
also  we may be unable to enter into and maintain new arrangements on a timely basis  or at all 
even if we do enter into additional distributor relationships  those distributors may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products 
we do not have the ability to prevent distributors from distributing products that compete with our products 
the distributors may also give higher priority to the products of our competitors 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of our revenue sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period 
we have experienced periods in which sales to some of our major customers  as a percentage of total revenue  have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future periods 
our top ten customers comprised of our revenue in fiscal in fiscal  physician sales and service  inc pssi accounted for approximately of our total revenue and gmr marketing gmr accounted for of our total revenue 
in fiscal  pssi accounted for approximately of our total revenue and gmr accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers 
customers generally purchase our products pursuant to cancelable short term purchase orders 
if we were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed  our results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents if third party reimbursement for use of our products is eliminated or reduced  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail in the united states of america  healthcare providers that purchase products such as the ldx system generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used 
we will be unable to successfully market our products if their purchase and use is not subject to reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
if this reimbursement is not available or is limited  healthcare providers will be much less likely to use our products  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail 
there are current conditions in the healthcare industry that increase the possibility that third party payors may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for tests using our products in certain settings 
these conditions include third party payors increasingly scrutinize and challenge the prices charged for medical products and services  healthcare providers are moving toward a managed care system in which they provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per patient and authorize fewer elective procedures  such as uses of our products for diagnostic screening  general uncertainty regarding what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party payors and how that will affect use of products such as ours  which may deter healthcare providers from adopting the use of our products  and an overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both domestic and international  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by us 
market acceptance of our products in international markets is also dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare systems 
reimbursement and healthcare systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the united states of america or international markets  and current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future 
also  future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
any of these events could materially harm our business 
if the healthcare system in the united states of america undergoes fundamental change  these changes may harm our business we believe that the healthcare industry in the united states of america is likely to undergo fundamental changes due to current political  economic and regulatory influences 
we anticipate that congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems 
potential alternatives include mandated basic healthcare benefits  controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending  the creation of large insurance purchasing groups  price controls and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system 
we expect legislative debate to continue in the 
table of contents future and for market forces to demand reduced costs 
we cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform measures  future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business 
any changes in the healthcare system could potentially have extremely negative effects on our business 
our products are subject to multiple levels of government regulation and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and may be damaging to our business the manufacture and sale of our diagnostic products  including the ldx system  is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
we are unable to commence marketing or commercial sales in the united states of america of any of the new tests we develop until we receive the required clearances and approvals 
the process of obtaining required regulatory clearances and approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
as a result  our new tests under development  even if successfully developed  may never obtain such clearance or approval 
additionally  certain material changes to products that have already been cleared or approved are subject to further review and clearance or approval 
medical devices are subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a cleared product may result in restrictions on the product s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we lose previously obtained clearances  or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  we may be unable to market the affected products  which would depress our revenue and severely harm our business 
in addition  any future amendment of or addition to regulations impacting our products could prevent us from marketing the ldx system 
regulatory changes could hurt our business by increasing burdens on our products or by reducing or eliminating certain competitive advantages of the ldx system s waived status 
food and drug administration clearance or approval of products such as ours can be obtained by either of two processes the k clearance process  which generally takes from four to months but may take longer  and the pre market approval process  which is a longer and more costly process than a k clearance process  involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information and generally takes one to three years but may take significantly longer 
if our future products are required to obtain a pre market approval  this would significantly delay our ability to market those tests and significantly increase the costs of development 
the use of our products and those of our competitors is also affected by federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing  as well as by the laws and regulations of foreign countries 
the scope of these regulations includes quality control  proficiency testing  personnel standards and inspections 
in the united states of america  clinical laboratory testing is regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement act of the ldx analyzer  our total cholesterol  high density lipoproteins  triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination and our alt test cassette have been classified as waived from the application of many of the requirements under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments 
we believe this waived classification is critical for our products to be successful in their markets 
any failure of our new tests to obtain waived status under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments will severely limit our ability to 
table of contents commercialize such tests 
loss of waived status for existing diagnostic products or failure to obtain waived status for new products could limit our revenue  which would severely harm our business 
we may face fines or our manufacturing facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations our manufacturing processes and  in certain instances  those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to stringent federal  state and local regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in many things  including warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
any of these could harm our business 
we and our contract manufacturers are also subject to federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture of healthcare products and diagnostic devices  including quality system regulations  which requires the maintenance of a quality system consistent with food and drug administration regulations  iso en requirements  which is an industry standard for maintaining and assuring conformance to quality standards  and other foreign regulations and state and local health  safety and environmental regulations  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or require us to incur significant costs to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations  which could harm our business 
our business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology through patents and other means and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have nine united states of america patents and have filed patent applications relating to our technology internationally under the patent cooperation treaty and individual foreign patent applications 
the risks of relying on the proprietary nature of our technology include our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or  if issued  such patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future  and the rights created under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage  competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents covering technologies that are more effective than ours 
this could render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive or could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states of america or in international markets  the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and 
table of contents an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the united states of america patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and will likely result in substantial diversion of attention of technical and management personnel 
in the past  patent infringement claims have been asserted against us 
on december   a complaint entitled roche diagnostics gmbh v 
health care solutions ag  euredix nv sa and cholestech corporation was filed with the canton court of the canton zug in zug  switzerland by roche diagnostics seeking a cease and desist order barring us and two of our distributors from distributing hdl assay single use test cassettes in switzerland 
the complaint alleges that we violated a roche european patent for hdl 
on july   the court denied the plaintiff s request for an injunction and ordered it to pay a portion of our legal fees 
on may   in response to our motion  the court ruled that it did not have local jurisdiction over us and ordered the plaintiff to pay our legal fees 
there can be no assurance as to whether the plaintiff will appeal this ruling or whether any additional action will be resolved in our favor 
additionally  in january  a complaint was filed in the district court  dusseldorf  germany against us and two of our distributors seeking a cease and desist order barring the distributors from shipping hdl single use test cassettes into germany 
the complaint alleges we and our distributors violated a roche german priority patent for hdl by selling our single use test cassette containing a hdl assay 
on december   a hearing was held in dusseldorf  germany at which cholestech and roche witnesses testified 
a hearing has been set for september  in september  we were served a complaint  no 
ei ti roch  filed in vienna  austria by roche diagnostics  seeking a cease and desist order barring us and one of our distributors from distributing hdl assay single use test cassettes in austria 
the complaint alleges that we violated a roche european patent for hdl 
at this point  no schedule has been set regarding court activity 
we believe all suits are without merit and intend to defend the cases vigorously 
we do not believe that we engaged in any wrongdoing and that the outcome of this matter will not result in a material adverse effect  however  there can be no assurance that the lawsuits will be resolved in our favor 
we rely on trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
we may also be unable to meaningfully protect our right to our trade secrets 
we depend on technology that we license from others  which may not be available to us in the future and would prevent us from introducing new products and harm our business our current products incorporate technologies that are the subject of patents issued to  and patent applications filed by  others 
we have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies 
we may in the future be required to obtain licenses for new products 
we may be unable to obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also may be unable to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses 
also  our future licenses may not be adequate for 
table of contents the operation of our business 
failure to obtain adequate licenses on commercially reasonable terms could prevent us from producing our products and severely harm our business 
we may be unable to effectively compete against other providers of diagnostic products and testing services  which could cause our sales to decline the markets for diagnostic products and testing services in which we operate are intensely competitive 
our competition consists primarily of clinical and hospital laboratories  as well as manufacturers of bench top analyzers 
to achieve market acceptance for the ldx system  we must demonstrate that the ldx system is an attractive alternative to bench top analyzers as well as to clinical and hospital laboratories 
this will require physicians to change their established means of having such tests performed 
the ldx system may be unable to compete with these other testing services and analyzers 
in addition  companies with a significant presence in the market for therapeutic monitoring  such as abbott laboratories  bayer diagnostics  beckman coulter  inc and roche diagnostics a subsidiary of roche holdings  ltd 
have developed or are developing analyzers designed for point of care testing 
these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than us 
these competitors also offer broader product lines than us  have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several smaller companies are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
even if we do have such resources and capabilities  we may not employ them successfully 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional qualified associates  we cannot grow our business our success depends in significant part on the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  regulatory and managerial personnel 
our success will also require us to continue to identify  attract  hire and retain additional highly qualified personnel in those areas 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our industry 
we may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract or retain other necessary highly qualified personnel in the future  which would harm the development of our business 
product liability and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates sale and use of our products and performance of our testing services could lead to the filing of a product liability or professional liability claim 
if any of these claims are brought  we may have to expend significant resources defending against them 
if we are found liable for any of these claims  we may have to pay damages that could severely hurt our financial position 
loss of these claims could also hurt our reputation  resulting in our losing business and market share 
the medical testing industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to these liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury or improper diagnosis 
we also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
we currently maintain product liability and professional liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate 
insurance is expensive and 
table of contents difficult to obtain  and we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability 
inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products 
in addition  a product liability or professional liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could severely hurt our financial condition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and such additional funds may not be available to us we intend to expend substantial funds for capital expenditures and working capital related to research and development  expansion of sales and marketing activities and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
we also plan to expend significant amounts in further developing our testing services business 
although we believe our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow anticipated to be generated by future operations and available bank borrowings under an existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future  we may still require additional financing 
for example  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in expanding manufacturing capacity for existing cassettes or in the course of completing required additional development  obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining waived status under clia or introducing or scaling up manufacturing for new tests 
further developing our testing services business may also require more capital than we currently anticipate 
if we need additional capital in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing shareholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could prevent us from developing our products and our business 
we have made use of devices to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill anti takeover plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the poison pill may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the poison pill may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the poison pill 

table of contents our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our stock has in the past been  and is likely in the future to continue to be  highly volatile 
these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us and our competitors  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  changes in the current structure of the healthcare financing and payment systems  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which are often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies  and general economic  political and market conditions 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
this type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future  which could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert management s attention from running our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures our exposure to market risks is inherent in our operations  primarily to interest rates relating to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments as of march  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have concluded that the fair market value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates due to the nature of our marketable securities  which do not mature beyond fiscal and have primarily fixed interest rates 

table of contents the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments 
total fair value in thousands cash  cash equivalents short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio
