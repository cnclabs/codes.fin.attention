viisage products annually produce more than million identification documents at more than  locations in states 
the company has also provided services under subcontracts for projects in jamaica  the philippines and for the us immigration and naturalization service 
originally developed at mit  face recognition technology is widely recognized as the most convenient  non intrusive and cost effective biometric available 
viisage s patented face recognition technology is focused on five major product application areas 
faceexplorer tm  viisage s technology for image retrieval and analysis  is recognized for its leadership technology performance in real time and large database applications 
faceexplorer tm is deployed in the world s largest face recognition application with a database of more than million enrolled images and is growing by  new images per day 
the product family of face recognition applications also includes facenet tm for internet and e commerce security  facepin tm for point of sale transactions verification  facepass tm for physical access control and keyless entry  and facefinder tm for surveillance and identification 
the company is engaged in one business  the development and implementation of digital identification systems and solutions 
the company has an integrated business model identification solutions through system integration systems and biometric software 
substantially all of the company s revenues have been derived within the united states of america 
the company provides systems and services principally under contracts that have five to seven year terms and several optional annual renewals after the initial contract term 
contracts generally provide for a fixed price for the system and or for each identification card produced 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the projected number of cards to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
biometric revenues were approximately of total revenues in  although no single customer accounted for over 
the balance of the company s revenue is primarily derived from the secure identification systems customers 
the company believes for the near future that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
for the years ended december  customers who accounted for more than of the company s revenue in a given year were as follows 
for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of 
for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of 
for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of the company s results of operations are significantly affected by  among other things  the timing of awards and performance on contracts 
as a result  the company s revenues and income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and comparisons over longer periods may be more meaningful 
the company s results of operations are not seasonal since contracts are awarded and performed throughout the year 
however  the company believes its public sector business is subject to cyclical procurement delays that may be related to election cycles 
critical accounting policies the company considers the following accounting policies critical to its results of operations and financial condition contract revenue and cost recognition the company provides services principally under contracts that provide for a fixed price for each system and or for each identification card produced 
revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on labor costs incurred and or cards produced 
contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are recorded as a current asset 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and accrued contract costs are recorded as current liabilities 
generally  contracts provide for billing when contract milestones are met and or cards are produced 
these contracts are typically long term contracts  typically five years or longer 
the value of these contracts are based on estimated volume of identification cards to be produced and estimated contract costs 
any significant reductions in volume will have a negative impact on the company s financial condition 
volumes can be impacted by legislative changes to the life of the identification credentials  lack of government funding  or termination of contract for lack of performance 
management reviews the historical trends of card productions quarterly to estimate the volumes that are to be used to calculate contract values 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company  on a quarterly basis  estimates the cost to complete on each contract by reviewing the performance against budgets that are established during the quoting process 
adjustments are made to reflect the current information that is available such as card volumes  per card consumable costs  ongoing maintenance costs and site inventory levels 
the financial performance of the company could be impacted by any negative change in management s estimates and assumptions that are inherent in contract accounting 
results of operations year ended december  and revenues are derived principally from multi year contracts for system implementation  card production and related services

the increase is due principally to the company s continuing efforts in marketing its patented biometric solutions as the company continues to increase its distribution and marketing capabilities for its facial recognition solutions by adding and certifying new system integrators and reseller partners 
this allows the company to control its costs while increasing its marketing capabilities 
research and development expenses increased by or million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is due principally to the company s continued investment in biometrics 
research and development costs do not include amounts for specific projects that are allocated to project costs  and do not reflect the benefits to viisage under license arrangements from the research and development efforts of lau technologies and the massachusetts institute of technology for projects that are not directly related to the company 
the company expects to continue to invest in product development as the market for its products continues to expand in fiscal at approximately the same levels as general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged between and this represents an increase to from of revenue

accounting change 
during the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force eitf application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingency adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible instruments 
eitf no 
requires the remeasurement of the original issue discount on preferred stock with characteristics similar to the convertible preferred stock issued by the company during fiscal year this accounting change required the value of the warrants issued with the preferred stock to be included in calculating the beneficial conversion value 
this resulted in a cumulative charge of  to income applicable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   which consisted entirely of cash 
there were no cash or cash equivalents at december the company has a million revolving line of credit which is a sweep account  set up to maintain the lowest possible balance on the revolver  by maintaining a zero balance of cash at all times 
as a result of the company s private sale of common stock and warrants in december  the revolving line of credit was paid in full and the daily sweep account is earning interest for the company 
the revolving line of credit expires on june  accounts receivable increased approximately from december  to december  this was the result of the timing of billings  which liquidated a portion of the costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings decreased approximately from december  to december   which reflects the billing of accumulated contract costs incurred in prior periods 
in february  the company s revolving credit agreement was amended to provide for a term note in the amount of  related to project financing 
the term note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments of approximately  including principal and interest  and matures in march as of december  the outstanding balance was approximately  in september  the revolving credit agreement was amended to provide for a term note in the amount of  related to project financing 
the term note bears interest at and is payable in monthly installments of approximately  including principal and interest  and matures in march as of december  the outstanding balance was  the term notes are subject to the same financial covenants as the revolving line of credit 
upon notice by the lender  the entire principal and accrued interest can become immediately due and payable following the termination of the revolver in june this would result in the acceleration of the then principal balance of million to be due june the equipment for the specific project collateralizes the term notes 
the company also has system project lease financing arrangements with commercial leasing organizations 
pursuant to these arrangements  the lessor purchases certain of the company s digital identification systems and leases them back to the company for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of the company s rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under these arrangements  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by the company s customers  but the company bears performance and appropriation risk and is generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
the company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as defined by each lessor 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under these lease financing arrangements 
future minimum payments related to project capital leases  term notes  and operating leases are approximately in thousands capital term operating leases notes leases year ending total minimum payments    less interest portion present value of net minimum lease payments  less current portion   long term portion   for the fiscal year ended december  the existing financial covenants under the revolving line of credit and two of the project financing arrangements were amended to allow for the impact of the unsuccessful acquisition of the polaroid identification systems division and the impact of the million private placement 
effective for fiscal year ended december  all financial covenants for these agreements were eliminated as long as the company maintains a cash balance greater than the total of the long term debt and project financing 
the financial covenants of the remaining financing arrangements were not amended as of december  and the company was in violation of the positive net income covenant 
subsequent to december   the company received a waiver for this covenant violation 
the company believes that it will be in compliance with the amended debt covenants 
however  this expectation is dependent on achieving the company s business plan 
if the company does not meet such covenants  the bank and the lessors could require immediate repayment of outstanding amounts 
in april  the company received a commitment from lau to lend up to million in exchange for a convertible subordinated note 
amounts drawn under the note  with lau s consent  and related accrued interest could be converted at lau s option into shares of the company s common stock at any time through the expiration date of january  at per share 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under this commitment 
on january  the debt and accrued interest were converted into  shares of common stock and the commitment terminated 
in march  for an initial investment of million of which million was funded in may   following the effectiveness of the registration statement on form s  the company agreed to issue to strong river investments  inc sri  shares of common stock  a closing warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  exercisable for five years at per share  and an adjustable warrant which has been exercised for a total of  shares of common stock

the company believes that if it meets its business forecast for  cash flows from available borrowings  project leasing  operations and capital raised will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to meet its business forecast is dependent on a number of factors  including those described under certain factors that may affect future results in item a below 
inflation although certain of the company s expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results to date 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that the company recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas  that the company reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
the company has no goodwill or acquired intangible assets as of december  in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
becomes effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter quarter of fiscal and does not expect adopting sfas no 
to affect its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
market risk except for the company s revolving credit facility  which has a variable interest rate  the company has no material exposure to market risk that could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company currently has no outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
our business depends on large public sector contracts  which can involve delays 
our business depends on a limited number of large public sector contracts 
these contracts result from purchasing decisions made by public sector agencies that are often subject to political influence  onerous procurement procedures  budget changes and award protests 
these factors can cause delays  which make our quarterly results difficult to predict 
this can also make our ability to meet analysts expectations equally uncertain and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our quarterly results could be volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect those fluctuations to continue 
our quarterly results are affected by  among other things  factors such as 
the size and timing of contract awards  
the timing of our contract performance  
variations in the mix of our products and services  and 
contract losses and changes in management estimates inherent to accounting for contracts 
the loss of any significant customer could cause our revenue to decline 
for the year ended december   four customers each accounted for over of company revenues and an aggregate of approximately of revenues 
for  four customers each accounted for over of our revenues and a total of approximately of our revenues for the year 
for  four customers each accounted for over of our revenues and a total of approximately of our revenues for the year 
the loss of any significant customer could cause our revenue to decline and thus have an adverse material effect on our business and financial condition 
we have had a history of operating losses 
our business operations began in and  except for fiscal years and  have resulted in net losses in each fiscal year 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of our biometrics technologies and thus we cannot predict when or if we will ever achieve overall profitability 
the market for our common stock has been volatile 
the market for stock of many security related businesses  including viisage  has been highly volatile  especially since the terrorist attacks of september  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate widely in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock are likely to include 
responses to quarter to quarter variations in our results of operations  
the announcement of new contracts  products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  
technological innovation by our competitors  or us 
general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and 
changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
our leverage creates financial and operating risk that could limit the growth of our business 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million in short and long term debt and lease financing 
our leverage could have important consequences to us including 
limiting our ability to obtain necessary financing for future working capital  
limiting our ability to finance the acquisition of equipment needed to meet customer requirements  
limiting our ability to finance the development of new technologies  
requiring that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service and not other operating purposes  and 
requiring us to comply with financial and operating covenants  which could cause an event of default under our debt instruments 
further  our ability to make principal and interest payments under long term indebtedness and bank loans will be dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic and other factors affecting us  some of which are beyond our control 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital required to fund our operations and finance our growth 
the installation of our digital identification systems requires significant capital expenditures 
in addition  the further development of our biometric and other advanced technologies is expected to require additional capital 
although we recently completed a million private placement of our common stock and have been successful in the past in obtaining project financing  we will have ongoing capital needs as we expand our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our operations or expand our business to meet our plans 
if we are unable to obtain capital when we need it  we may have to restructure our business or delay or abandon our development and expansion plans 
that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could cause delays or increases in project costs 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture or develop components  software and consumables  which are used for our systems and services 
some of these items are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or alternative sources of supply could cause delays or increases in project costs 
if we do not successfully expand our direct sales and services organizations and partnering arrangements  we may not be able to increase our sales or support our customers 
in the fiscal year ended december  and  we licensed substantially all of our products through our direct sales organization 
our future success depends on substantially increasing the size and scope of our direct sales force and partnering arrangements  both domestically and internationally 
there is intense competition for personnel  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional qualified sales personnel on a timely basis 
moreover  we believe that as our sales increase  and given the large scale deployment required by our customers  we will need to hire and retain a number of highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase the size of our customer service and support organization on a timely basis to provide the high quality of support required by our customers 
failure to add additional sales and customer service representatives would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we lose any key personnel  or fail to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to continue expanding our business and product line 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and there can be no assurance that we can attract  assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future 
if our target customers do not accept our biometric technologies  our growth may be restricted 
our growth plan assumes  in part  that biometric technologies will gain widespread market acceptance 
although we have had success with several recent biometric projects  the widespread market acceptance of biometric technologies remains uncertain 
if we fail to keep pace with changing technologies  we may not win new customers 
rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards characterize our market 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
to achieve our goals  we need to develop cost effective business solutions and methodologies to keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and customer preferences 
system failures could seriously damage our business 
we depend on our ability to provide customers with complex systems  which can operate on an as needed basis 
although we deploy back up systems  system failures could result in increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
this could result in contract terminations and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we are controlled by a single stockholder  which could result in it taking actions  which other stockholders do not approve 
lau technologies lau beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  lau has a strong influence on matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of all of the directors and most corporate actions 
we have certain contractual relations with lau that could give rise to conflicts of interest 
competition from new entrants and bigger  more established competitors with greater financial resources could diminish our business opportunities and limit our growth 
the business areas in which we compete are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to continue 
in particular  the events of september  have heightened interest in the use of biometric technologies and competition in this field is expected to intensify 
there is no assurance that companies with greater financial resources and name recognition will not enter our business sectors 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to technological developments and changes in customers needs 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  affect our competitive position and cost us money 
we believe our intellectual property  including our proprietary methodologies  is important to our success and competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property against others unauthorized use  our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected 
our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined in light of the following risks 
non recognition of the proprietary nature of or inadequate protection of our methodologies in the united states or foreign countries  
undetected misappropriation of our proprietary methodologies  and 
development of similar software or applications by our competitors 
the materialization of any of these risks could require us to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and could divert our managerial resources 
in addition  our proprietary methodologies may decline in value or our rights to them may be unenforceable 
others could claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  and harm to our reputation 
although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot give any assurances that we can successfully defend an infringement claim 
a successful infringement claim against us could materially and adversely affect us in the following ways 
we may be liable for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  
we may be enjoined from further use of the intellectual property  
we may have to license the intellectual property  incurring licensing fees  
we may have to develop a non infringing alternative  which could be costly and delay projects  and 
we may have to indemnify clients with respect to losses incurred as a result of our infringement of the intellectual property 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim could result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation 
you may be subject to dilution 
we have outstanding stock purchase warrants and stock options that could result in dilution for our common stockholders  depending upon the market price of the company s common stock from time to time 
you should not expect dividends from us 
we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the near future
