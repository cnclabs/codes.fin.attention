item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a rapidly growing specialty retailer offering a vast selection of arts  crafts and floral merchandise to a broad demographic of consumers 
our target customers are primarily women between the ages of and who are looking for ideas to decorate their homes  create handmade items  or otherwise engage in arts and crafts activities 
we have grown from stores in january to stores in december our stores are located in the eastern united states from new england to the carolinas 
we established our first store in moorestown  new jersey in and grew to five stores by the end of we added a total of additional stores in and in  we began implementing an aggressive expansion plan and built our infrastructure to position us for that growth 
by the end of  we had recruited experienced senior retail executives in the areas of operations  merchandising and finance  and made key additions and changes in other areas such as buying  information systems  human resources and real estate 
from through we continued to strengthen and expand our management team including the addition of lawrence h 
fine as our president in june we also continued to develop our operating systems  the most important of which was our pos system implemented in august in  we leased a new  square foot distribution center and office complex in suburban philadelphia  which was expanded to  square feet in we also developed an automated ordering system using edi to link us electronically with most of our vendors and developed a real estate program to accommodate our expansion plan 
in  we received financing for our growth through an initial public offering of our common stock with net proceeds  after the payment of outstanding debt  of approximately million 
in and  we continued implementing our expansion strategy by opening a total of new stores 
in we did not meet our profit objectives 
as a result  in  we made a decision to concentrate on improving the profitability of our existing store base and to open only three stores 
we revamped our store opening procedures  prepared our systems for further expansion  and strengthened our merchandising with improved communication between our store management and our buyers 
with the changes we made in  we re established our expansion plan and opened ten new stores in and new stores in during the next two years  we intend to increase our store base by approximately per year  all within miles of our suburban philadelphia distribution center  an area encompassing approximately of the united states population 
we believe we can operate at least stores in this area without significantly diluting sales in our existing stores 
to accommodate this growth  we are in the process of negotiating the leasing and construction of a new distribution center which will initially be  square feet plus  square feet of office space and will be located near our existing distribution center 
we plan to expand the new distribution center to  square feet by the end of and then vacate our existing distribution center

quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly operating results for our eight most recent quarterly periods and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars in thousands  except share and store data 
first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales         cost of sales         gross margin         selling  general and administrative         pre opening expense  income loss from operations   interest expense income  net income loss before income taxes   income tax expense benefit   net income loss   net income loss per share  diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
        number of stores open at end of period comparable store sales increase due to the importance of our peak selling season  which includes fall halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  the fourth quarter has historically contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  virtually all of our profitability for the entire year 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting us during the fourth quarter of any year  including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the length of holiday seasons  the date on which holidays fall  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of store pre opening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the amount of sales returns  the timing and level of markdowns and other competitive factors 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands 
accordingly  any delay or failure by us in identifying and correctly responding to changing merchandise trends and consumer demand could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores 
in addition  we make decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for merchandise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  either from lost sales due to insufficient inventory or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
liquidity and capital resources our cash is used primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and fixtures and equipment  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores 
in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering in and with borrowings under bank financing agreements 
at december  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
during  and  cash of million  million and million was generated by operations  respectively 
in these three periods  million  million and million of cash  respectively  was used to increase inventory levels to support both new and existing stores 
in these periods  part of the inventory increase was financed through increases in accounts payable of million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
this use of cash was for capital expenditures of million in  million in  and million in in  capital expenditures related principally to new store openings 
in  capital expenditures related principally to new store openings and the implementation of the pos system 
in capital expenditures included million for new store openings and for major renovations in existing stores and million relating to pos and other systems development 
in  we received million in cash upon the maturity of investment grade securities held by us 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which includes approximately million for new store openings  and the remainder for remodeling existing stores  upgrading systems in existing stores  warehouse equipment and corporate systems development 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures 
in the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  principally as a result of million of proceeds received from equipment financing 
on august   we replaced our million credit facility with a new million three year revolving credit agreement with keybank national association  on its own behalf and as administrative agent  and first union national bank 
borrowings under this credit facility accrue interest at rates that will vary between libor plus basis points and libor plus basis points  depending on the fixed charge coverage ratio at the time of borrowing 
the borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
at december   based upon the eligibility criteria contained in the agreement  the maximum borrowings available were million 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we lease our retail stores  distribution center  satellite warehouse facilities and corporate headquarters under noncancelable operating leases 
at december  our total obligations under these operating leases was million 
in addition  we had capital lease obligations of million at december  the following table reflects as of december  the payments due for the periods indicated under our capital and operating leases
