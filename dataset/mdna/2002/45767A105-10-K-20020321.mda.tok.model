item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations years ended december  and insignia s year was marked by a slowing worldwide economy  disruption in the markets following the september th tragedy and the strategic decision to sell realty one 
service revenues from continuing operations declined to million  and income from continuing operations declined to million 
the year began following heady services revenue growth in with most markets  particularly the manhattan office market  the central london office market and the manhattan co op and condominium market  marked by short supply 
insignia s business plan for at the beginning of the year noted such short supply as the constraining factor that would likely limit volume 
following a better than normal first quarter  volume began to slow 
in retrospect  this was the first sign of a slowing global economy 
that condition became the factor most affecting operations during rather than the short supply originally anticipated 
the third quarter was particularly poor 
a disproportionate amount of third quarter volume is typically concluded in the post labor day us and post august holiday europe periods 
however  the usually high volume month of september became the weakest month of the year in the aftermath of september th 
this was particularly the case in new york  which is by far the largest market for insignia 
the fourth quarter rebounded both as a result of business beginning to return to normal  including the conclusion of many of the largest transactions in progress during the year as well as some additional  unanticipated volume assisting tenants displaced in new york city 
as a result  insignia reported acceptable results for the year  particularly considering the economic conditions and their affect on client decisions 
however  such results were well below the record results 
insignia management monitors and evaluates its financial performance using three measures 
net ebitda is defined as income before depreciation  amortization  income taxes and non recurring charges 
net ebitda deducts all interest expense and includes funds from operations ffo from real estate investments 
real estate ffo is defined as income or loss from real estate operations before depreciation  gains or losses on sales of property and provisions for impairment 
the second measure used by management is income from real estate operations 
this measure deducts depreciation and amortization from the net ebitda measure 
it also includes gains or losses on real estate investments together with income taxes associated with service operations and real estate investments 
the final measure is income from continuing operations 
this measure further incorporates the now completed internet business and investment strategy as well as non recurring life insurance proceeds in net ebitda  ffo and income from real estate operations are measures that are not defined by gaap and insignia s usage of these terms may differ from other companies usage of the same or similar terms 
the table on the following page depicts our operating results  in a format that highlights the above three measures  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating results for all periods presented reflect the results of realty one on a discontinued basis for financial reporting purposes 
certain amounts for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
this information has been derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years then ended 
year ended december  in thousands real estate services revenues insignia esg    europe    residential    total real estate services revenues    cost and expenses real estate services    administrative    ebitda real estate services    real estate ffo    interest and other income    foreign currency transaction gains  interest expense    merger related expenses  net ebitda    applicable income tax    after tax net ebitda    gains on sale of real estate    real estate impairment  tax on real estate   depreciation ff e    amortization of intangibles    depreciation real estate    income from real estate operations    life insurance proceeds  losses from internet investments    income tax benefit   income from continuing operations    discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operation  net of applicable taxes   provision for loss on disposal  net of applicable taxes  loss income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of applicable taxes  net loss income    neither ebitda nor net ebitda  as disclosed above  should be construed to represent cash provided by operations determined pursuant to gaap 
these measures are not defined by gaap and insignia s usage of these terms may differ from other companies usage of the same or similar terms 
as compared to net income  the ebitda and net ebitda measures effectively eliminate the impact of non cash charges for depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and other non recurring charges 
management believes that the presentation of these supplemental measures enhance a reader s understanding of the company s operating performance as they provide a measure of generated cash 
real estate ffo is defined as income or loss from real estate operations before depreciation  gains or losses on sales of property and provisions for impairment 
this measure is not defined by gaap and insignia s usage of this term may differ from other companies usage of the same or similar terms 
management uses this supplemental measure in the evaluation of principal real estate investment activities and believes that it provides a measure of generated cash flows for the company s real estate operations 
commercial real estate services revenues from commercial services declined  or million  to million in united states commercial services revenue declined by million to million  european revenues declined by million to million and start up operations in asia and mexico added million in revenues 
ebitda from commercial services declined by  or million  to million 
united states ebitda declined by million to million  european ebitda declined by million to million and the start up asian and latin american operations produced negative ebitda of million 
revenues in commercial services are significantly impacted by sab the impact is primarily confined to the united states  though a small number of european transactions are impacted 
sab required a change as of the beginning of in the manner in which leasing commissions are recognized as revenue 
leasing is the single largest source of revenue to insignia 
for  leasing commissions accounted for of u 
s 
commercial services revenue  more than of worldwide commercial services revenue and more than of insignia s total revenues 
insignia represents both tenants and landlords in the leasing of commercial property office  industrial and retail 
the leasing process may last from weeks to years 
once a lease is signed and a commission agreement is in place  insignia s services are concluded 
however  market customs and individual negotiations govern the terms of the commission agreement 
some commissions are earned and payable upon execution of the lease 
some are payable in installments on specific dates 
others are payable in installments on the occurrence of certain events  such as lease execution  occupancy by the tenant  or payment of rent for a specified period typically first month  first six months or first year 
in other much rarer instances  installments are paid on a schedule that may require a refund by insignia if events such as those identified in the preceding sentence fail to occur 
under sab  any commission billable or refundable upon a condition other than the passage of time may not be recognized until the billing condition is met or the refund contingency expires 
the primary impact of sab is the recognition of income on affected leases from the date insignia s performance is complete to the date the tenant satisfies the obligations under his lease that are specified conditions in the commission agreement 
in  application of sab reduced reported revenues by million 
in  the application of sab increased revenues by more than million 
the impact on was the result of recognition of previously completed leases closed during the years  reduced by deferrals of transactions 
it is important to note that sab does not affect many leasing transactions 
in fact  the largest transactions concluded in both and were not affected by the provisions of sab this accounting requirement does limit insignia s ability to predict its revenues in the short term one quarter to one year 
this occurs because the conditions of sab are controlled by the tenant and not by insignia  and insignia s estimate of the date those events will occur often varies by months 
further  while insignia monitors its transaction backlog from prospect to conclusion  no particular transaction can be reliably forecast from a revenue recognition standpoint until the commission agreement is executed with the conditions to billing specified 
this often occurs at or near the same time as the execution of the lease 
united states commercial services benefited from the investment programs undertaken in prior years by the financial services portion of the business 
those investments reached a meaningful income production stage in  increasing their ebitda contribution by million to million 
an earnings contribution of approximately million was provided by insignia opportunity trust  which became fully invested in  representing an increase from  in the year a second similar fund was launched in late did not begin to produce income during the year 
in addition  the development program commenced several years ago increased its contribution to approximately million in  compared to approximately million in insignia is currently emphasizing its investment programs  however  no new development projects have commenced since mid  and four properties are currently under development 
the traditional commercial services portion of the us operation suffered a decline in ebitda of more than million in  compared to this decline on only a marginal decrease in revenues arose from a number of factors  the largest of which was higher commission expense 
commission expense includes a formulaic bonus to the consulting department computed on commission revenues allocated to that department 
in  revenues were recognized under sab as to which contractual bonuses to the consulting department had been paid in prior years  without any ability to recover 
this circumstance created a million lower commission expense in than would have occurred without the accounting change under sab and also contributes to an increase in the average reported commission rate for in late  the company modified the formulaic consulting department bonus such that the expense of such bonus would match reported revenues in future periods 
further  production in was skewed toward markets with higher average commission rates  and within those markets  production was relatively greater among brokers who had attained higher commission splits 
the result was an overall commission expense of million higher than the amount that would have been recorded at average commission rates 
there were no changes in overall commission programs that would otherwise account for this change 
rent expense increased by approximately million in of this increase  approximately million arose from the renewal at the company s new york city headquarters 
most of the remainder of the increase was attributable to expansions primarily in california  boston and washington 
also  insignia s share of expenses of the octane consortium increased by nearly million  to million  in conversely  incentive compensation declined by approximately million as a result of lower earnings 
insignia s european operations are dominated by its uk offices  which produced more than of european revenues and ebitda for and the decline in european revenues and ebitda in is directly attributable to lower leasing and investment sales volume in the key london market 
for  revenues from leasing and investment sales declined from levels by and to million and million  respectively 
the year was an exceptional period for both of these service lines as transaction volume reached unprecedented levels 
entering  market expectations were that activity levels would not be sustained and results for reflected this expected decline 
the weakened economic conditions and the unavoidable period of inactivity that followed the events of september th further compounded the declines in europe 
at the same time  revenues from professional services and consulting in remained relatively flat as compared to property services revenues for were maintained by the valuation practice  which experienced growth in assignments compared to the levels experienced in during  insignia opened a small office in madrid  spain and added staff to its offices in brussels and milan 
most importantly  in december  insignia acquired insignia bourdais  one of the largest real estate service firms in france 
for not included in insignia s results  insignia bourdais produced revenues of almost million 
asian and latin american operations were started in and collectively produced ebitda losses of million 
these operations now give insignia the ability to serve clients in hong kong  china  japan  thailand  india  mexico and parts of south america 
the losses for the year were greater than insignia had anticipated as a result of later additions of important capability and the weak asian economies 
insignia had expected these operations to be profitable in when the decision was made to expand into the markets 
however  it now seems likely that losses will continue in the first half of with an objective of attaining break even status for the year 
residential real estate services revenues from residential services provided through new york based insignia douglas elliman and insignia residential group declined  or million  to million in virtually all of the decline from year s exceptionally strong pace can be attributed to the erosion in transaction volume and sales prices in the new york apartment market 
insignia douglas elliman produced service revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the year 
these operating results represented sharp declines of  or million  for revenues and  or million  for ebitda  compared to the softening of the economy in early  which continued up to and was exacerbated by the events of september th  led to a serious deterioration in contract activity in the new york city and tri state area markets 
the volume of units sold dropped more than from and average sales prices declined year over year 
further  gross transaction volume declined to billion in the decrease in activity was experienced across the mix of real estate inventory in the new york city marketplace  with the only exceptions being increases in sales of new cooperative development projects and commercial space leasing 
insignia douglas elliman s earnings in were hindered most significantly by the adverse affects of the lower transaction volume on revenues 
although  an increase in average commission expense rates also contributed to the decline in ebitda in broker commission splits entering were in many cases maintained at year end levels  which had reached heightened levels due to the robust volumes achieved during the year 
the higher commission rate in resulted in a million decline in ebitda from the amount that would have been generated at commission levels 
other operating expenses in declined modestly from insignia residential group in showed a significant increase in ebitda compared to  despite a marginal decline in revenues to million 
for all of  insignia residential group generated ebitda of million  representing an increase to almost three times the level experienced in 
revenues from core management increased almost over as a result of higher fees on new business  the implementation of management fee increases to all existing clients and material declines in un reimbursed property related expenditures 
these operating efficiencies were achieved in part through a reorganization plan implemented in late that resulted in the termination of non profitable management engagements  prudent expense reductions and a better matching of revenues and operating expenses on a individual project basis 
this reorganization resulted in the achievement of more than million in total expense savings in the year was also marked by the second quarter engagement as property manager and leasing agent for peter cooper village and stuyvesant town  a  unit portfolio in manhattan 
the addition of this significant property portfolio contributed  to total revenues 
on an annualized basis  this engagement is estimated to contribute approximately million to insignia residential group s total service revenues 
administrative administrative expenses declined by to million in virtually the entire change relates to lower incentive compensation attributable to the lower overall performance of the company 
other items included in the determination of net ebitda interest and other income declined by to million 
one reason was lower interest rates available on short term investment of cash on hand 
the average rate for declined to approximately from over in at the same time  cash declined significantly in march as record incentive compensation was paid based on performance 
in addition  all remaining contingent purchase consideration for insignia s uk operations was achieved  resulting in a payment of more than million in march through issuance of loan notes secured by restricted cash 
as a result  average cash available for short term investment also declined by approximately million from interest expense increased despite lower interest rates 
insignia s interest rate on its revolving credit facility averaged approximately in versus in the average rate at december  was 
average borrowings were approximately million higher in as a result of million borrowed in mid for internet investments and a further million drawn in early the average interest rate on the million outstanding under the revolving credit facility after a million pay down in january was approximately 
in  insignia acquired baker commercial in dallas in an attempt to transform its predominantly property management business in dallas to a more balanced operation with quality brokerage capability 
as a part of that acquisition  insignia decided to vacate its existing office space and move to a location more suitable to the new business mix 
a charge of  was taken at the acquisition date in connection with the lease 
foreign currency translation was not a significant factor in as insignia closed out substantially all of its euro and pound borrowings in the second quarter the year 
real estate ffo from insignia s investment portfolio increased to million in more than  of the change was attributable to adding or selling properties during  while almost million of the increase was achieved solely from improved property operations 
of the ffo reported in  more than million related to properties sold during the year and no longer owned at december  ffo is a financial measure that is not defined by gaap and insignia s usage of this term may differ from other companies usage of the same or similar terms 
other items included in the determination of income gains on sales of real estate through minority owned entities nearly tripled to million 
the increase is substantially attributable to the sale of fresh meadows  an apartment complex in new york in which insignia held a profits interest 
this property was acquired in december property sales are difficult to predict and will likely vary considerably from year to year 
in addition  as a minority owner  insignia does not control the sale decision 
insignia currently expects to sell in between four and seven properties out of the thirty seven minority owned properties at december  based on insignia s current estimates of value  gains realized by insignia could range from million to million in  although there can be no assurances of the timing or amount of any gains 
insignia owns minority interests in entities owning three properties acquired in this was a lower than expected addition to the portfolio as a result of declining property prospects in our view 
insignia also recorded impairment write downs on four investments in insignia s analysis indicated that the lease prospects of a telecom building and lower income being produced by certain hotel assets resulted in values less than their carrying amounts 
depreciation expense excluding property depreciation in rose to million  or million over the increases are attributed to capital spending of more than million over the past three years for new information technology platforms and leasehold improvements in connection with the upgrade and relocation of offices in key us markets and london 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for the year 
this increase reflects amortization of contingent earnouts paid in such additional purchase consideration was recorded as costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses 
insignia wrote off all remaining internet business assets and investments in  except for a million investment in a multiple venture fund equivalent to fair value of that investment as reported by that fund s manager 
internet losses for totaled a net million  before tax effects  reflecting internet investment write downs of approximately million and income of million resulting from the final liquidation of edificerex in december this income represented the culmination of those losses of edificerex in excess of the company s investment basis incurred during the first half of when the company consolidated edificerex 
income taxes declined in  as compared to  commensurate with lower income 
insignia reported a net loss for of million  or per diluted share 
this net loss includes the effects of a million loss on disposal and a million net operating loss for the discontinued realty one operations 
despite the resulting significant book loss on disposal in  the decision to sell realty one was one of strategic significance 
the sale price of realty one was six times that operation s ebitda  representing a multiple that management believes is a significant premium over the value the public markets have placed on the company over the past three years 
years ended december  and insignia s results for and have been restated to segregate the operations of realty one on a discontinued basis for financial reporting purposes 
as disclosed above  insignia entered into a contract in late december to sell realty one and its affiliated companies headquartered in cleveland  ohio and completed the sale on january  insignia s financial results for were highlighted by record financial performance levels and a change in accounting for revenue recognition for leasing commissions in compliance with sab  which was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  the cumulative effect of the sab accounting change on prior years resulted in a reduction to income for of million net of applicable taxes of million  or per share 
the effect of retroactive application of the accounting change to january  lowered service revenues by million  net ebitda by million and income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by million  or per share  for the year 
for  insignia reported substantial growth compared to in all financial measures as service revenues grew to million and net ebitda grew  or million  to million 
income from real estate operations grew sharply to million for  reflecting a gain of over million for these operating results were fueled by vigorous organic growth in the company s u 
s 
and european commercial real estate services operations and full year contributions from insignia douglas elliman acquired in june and st 
quintin acquired in march 
commercial real estate services for  commercial services produced aggregate service revenues of million and ebitda of million  reflecting gains of for revenues and for ebitda  as compared to these results for reflect year over year growth pursuant to the sab accounting change  which materially understates actual growth over on a comparable basis 
commercial real estate services produced approximately and  respectively  of insignia s total service revenues and ebitda before unallocated administrative costs for substantially all of the revenue and ebitda gains in were from organic growth  reflecting the company s continued success in securing assignments from new and existing commercial real estate customers in both the united states and europe 
the company s asian operations were launched in december with the acquisition of brooke international 
the year was an extraordinary period for the us commercial real estate services operation 
the company s well developed us commercial service delivery platform and the continuation of strong economic conditions propelled operating performance to record levels 
for  the company generated us commercial service revenues of million and ebitda of million  representing material gains of for revenues and for ebitda  compared to us commercial leasing activity remained strong across the board  with all insignia esg regions contributing to the revenue and ebitda growth for the year 
it is noteworthy to add that the year over year domestic gains were almost entirely attributed to organic growth 
the new york region  the company s largest market  continued to produce exceptional operating results  generating more than of the company s total us commercial services revenue and ebitda for in europe  financial results for were also significant  with reported services revenue of million and ebitda of million 
such operating results reflected revenue gains of million  or  and ebitda gains of million  or  over the year was one of the most successful years in insignia richard ellis s history with operating results reflective of the full benefits of the merger with st 
quintin 
insignia richard ellis achieved the number one market position in central london  with responsibility for more leasing activity than any other firm 
as evidence  the company s uk operation generated service revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for these operating results represented growth of in revenues and in ebitda compared to the company s continental european businesses produced aggregate service revenues and ebitda of million and million before european administrative expenses  respectively  for these results  which represented gains over of million for revenues and million for ebitda  were attributable primarily to marked improvement in germany together with positive contributions from the netherlands operations  acquired in march residential real estate services residential services of insignia douglas elliman and insignia residential group generated aggregate service revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for this operating performance represented revenue gains of and ebitda gains of over and was substantially attributable to contributions from the full year of operations for insignia douglas elliman 
insignia douglas elliman produced service revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the year 
these operating results represented material increases of million  or  for revenues and million  or  for ebitda  compared to insignia residential group produced relatively flat operating results for  compared to  generating service revenues of million and ebitda of  the comparable results for were service revenues of million and ebitda of  administrative administrative expenses rose from million in to approximately million in these increases reflect increased executive compensation in connection with a new employment agreement with the chairman and robust performance meeting maximum incentive targets for the year 
other items included in the determination of net ebitda interest and other income increased from million in to million in the increase is attributed to materially higher average cash holdings during the year  in combination with gains of approximately  on forward contracts to purchase british pounds 
in addition  the company realized foreign currency gains of approximately million in  principally from facility borrowings in declining european currencies 
in comparison  foreign currency gains totaled  for the year 
interest expense increased  or million  to approximately million for  compared to this increase is due principally to increases in prevailing interest rates throughout  interest charges on credit facility borrowings of approximately million to finance the acquisitions of lynch murphy in boston  st 
quintin in the uk and douglas elliman and further borrowings of million in to finance e commerce initiatives 
the company recognized gains of million in from foreign currency transactions  principally from facility borrowings in declining european currencies 
such gains in totaled  again attributed primarily to fluctuations in pound and euro currency borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility 
in  the company incurred a one time charge of million million net of tax for merger related expenses in connection with the march acquisition of st 
quintin and its merger with richard ellis group limited 
the one time charge was substantially comprised of costs to vacate excess office space and  to a lesser extent  severance costs 
the charge included provisions for rent expense during the period from vacancy to sublease  costs of improvements required for sublease  rent concessions  excess rent over sublease terms and severance 
all excess office space was subleased and severance costs were incurred prior to december  real estate ffo from the company s investment programs totaled approximately million for  remaining relatively flat compared to million generated in ffo is a financial measure that is not defined by gaap and insignia s usage of this term may differ from other companies usage of the same or similar terms 
other items included in the determination of income gains from the sale of real estate totaled million for the year  increasing million over the million realized in real estate investment earnings for were lowered by impairment write downs of million in two investments in under performing assets 
based on the company s evaluation of the occupancy levels and operating cash flows of these properties it was concluded that the estimated recoverable value of these investments was less than book carrying value 
internet based business initiatives adversely affected income for  resulting in pre tax losses of approximately million for the year 
these losses include approximately million in aggregate impairment write downs including both internal initiatives and third party investments  million of edificerex operating losses during the first half of prior to de consolidation  and million of other internal operating expenses 
depreciation expense excluding property and internet depreciation continued to increase during consistent with capital spending during and for leasehold improvements  it infrastructure and financial accounting systems for the us businesses 
depreciation totaled approximately million in  a million increase over amortization of intangibles increased to million in  compared to million during the year reflects a full year impact of purchased intangible amortization for the acquisitions of st 
quintin and insignia douglas elliman 
income taxes for declined compared to  despite higher income  due primarily to the non taxable nature of income of million from life insurance proceeds 
the company s net earnings for were favorably affected by income of million from life insurance proceeds 
conversely  income for was adversely affected by pre tax internet losses totaling million  including million in impairment write downs of the company s internally developed businesses and certain third party investments 
earnings for the year were marked by the first quarter absence of large brokerage transactions in the aftermath of the late capital markets turmoil and the aforementioned million merger related charge related to the merger of the company s uk operations 
in  the company reported income  before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  of million 
this performance represented a significant increase of  over million  over on a per share basis  such earnings represented for compared to for the company reported a net loss of million for  after the million cumulative effect of the sab accounting change 
the cumulative effect of the sab accounting change lowered earnings per share by to a loss per share of 
liquidity and capital resources insignia s liquidity and capital resources are available in the form of cash  unused capacity under its revolving credit facility and cash generated by operations 
historically  capital expenditures and investments in minority ownership interests in real estate related investments have been funded through cash from operations  and the revolving credit facility has been used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of businesses and  in one instance  to fund e commerce investments of million 
the company uses after tax net ebitda as a proxy for its cash flow from operations 
while this measure differs from cash provided by operations under gaap  the gaap measure differences tend to be temporary in insignia s businesses and by its construction matches incentives earned in the prior year with current year operations 
thus  cash provided by operations for does not reflect record incentives for that year  while the lower performance of bears those record incentives in cash provided by operations 
additionally  cash provided by operations includes certain real estate interests and internet activity  which insignia views as non operating activities 
insignia s unrestricted cash at december  was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was used in the march to pay incentive compensation 
the remaining incentive compensation is payable only when and to the extent certain leasing commissions are collected 
other than this use  insignia does not expect the remainder to be required for operations other than for very short term fluctuations 
as a result  million was applied to reduce the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility in january the table below summarizes net ebitda after income tax effects and deductions for capital expenditures for the last three years to derive a measure of working capital resources produced by operations 
such capital resources represent amounts generally available for real estate investment or other purposes 
year ended december  in thousands net ebitda    applicable income tax    after tax net ebitda    capital expenditures    total    insignia s debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands debt outstanding amount under revolving credit facility   loan notes payable to sellers of acquired uk businesses  secured by restricted cash holdings   notes payable   real estate mortgage notes payable   total   with respect to the loan notes  all amounts are guaranteed by a bank as required by the terms of the respective purchase agreements and the bank holds restricted cash deposits sufficient to repay the notes in full when due 
real estate mortgage notes consist of three notes each secured by a single asset owned by insignia subsidiaries and is recourse only to the applicable real estate asset 
insignia s equity at book value in these three property subsidiaries totaled million at december  as a result of these two circumstances  insignia only considers the revolver in its analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
insignia s revolving credit facility matures in may and has a maximum availability of million 
in addition to the amount outstanding  insignia has outstanding letters of credit described further below of million million pertaining to real estate investment obligations that are considered outstanding amounts under the terms of the revolving credit facility 
as a result  the maximum remaining availability at december   was million increasing to million after giving effect to the use of existing cash in january to reduce the balance outstanding by million 
the revolving credit facility is subject to certain covenants  the most restrictive of which is the leverage ratio 
under this covenant  the maximum amount outstanding cannot exceed times ebitda for the trailing four quarters  after giving pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions 
because the third quarter of was so negatively affected by september th  insignia requested and obtained a temporary increase of the leverage ratio to until the third quarter of is no longer included in the trailing four quarters calculation 
insignia s request was not in respect of any default or potential default 
rather  insignia recognized that the inclusion of such a poor quarter  caused by very unusual and uncontrollable events  in the four quarters calculation would render availability for unforeseen investment opportunities unacceptably low 
at december   the actual availability under the revolver was approximately million  without taking into account any pro forma ebitda with respect to any future acquisition that might be made with a use of proceeds 
actual availability increased to million with the pay down in january insignia believes that the existing revolver contains sufficient capacity for any anticipated investment opportunities 
the revolving credit facility also is subject to a minimum net worth covenant of million 
insignia expects that it will record impairment on certain goodwill during the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of an accounting change required under sfas the amount of such impairment is not yet known  but it is possible that the amount could violate this covenant or bring insignia s net worth unacceptably close to the covenant 
insignia preliminarily estimates an aggregate impairment charge before tax effects in the range of million to million  based on current industry multiples 
the revolver contains a requirement for the banks to negotiate in good faith with insignia to effect a modification so that required accounting changes in accordance with gaap do not adversely affect insignia s compliance with covenants 
insignia invests in real estate assets and real estate related assets  usually as a minority owner and asset manager or property manager  with third party investors 
these investments include operating real estate properties  real estate under development and investment entities investing in below investment grade or lower rated securitized real estate debt 
each of these entities is debt financed 
the real estate entities in which insignia owns a minority interest are obligated on aggregate debt of million at december  each entity is liable only for its own debt  and a substantial majority of the debt is non recourse other than to the asset financed 
at december   the company s real estate investments totaled million and consisted of the following amount in thousands minority interests in operating properties  wholly owned properties  minority interests in development properties  land held for future development  minority interests in real estate debt investment funds  total real estate investments  the real estate carrying amounts of the three wholly owned properties at december  were financed by real estate mortgage notes encumbering the assets totaling million 
at december   insignia had invested capital of approximately million in these wholly owned properties and has no further obligations to the subsidiaries or their creditors 
one of the properties is an office building in tokyo  japan that was acquired for  and is under contract for sale to  a client 
the sale is expected to close in late march apart from the potential loss of its net investment  which totaled million at book value in all real estate entities at december   insignia s other assets are only at risk with respect to specific obligations it has undertaken or to standard carve outs in the mortgage lending industry from the non recourse provisions of mortgage loans 
insignia  as a matter of policy  would consider advancing funds to such an entity beyond its obligation as a new investment requiring normal returns 
at december   insignia s aggregate obligations to all such real estate entities consisted of the following amount in thousands letters of credit partially backing construction loans  other partial guarantees of property debt  future capital contributions for capital improvements future capital contributions for acquisitions  total obligations  insignia also has obligations for earnouts  or contingent consideration  with respect to past acquisitions 
one earnout of a maximum amount of million is believed extremely unlikely to ever become payable 
other acquisition earnouts  excluding insignia bourdais  are believed more likely than not of being met  and the amounts payable in that case would be as follows year amount in thousands total earnouts  insignia expects to pay these amounts from cash provided from operations 
with respect to insignia bourdais  the million paid at closing in a combination of cash and stock was based on an annual minimum ebitda expectation of million 
to the extent actual ebitda of insignia bourdais for the year ending march  exceeds that amount  additional purchase consideration of up to approximately million would become payable 
further  an earnout provision over calendar years  and provides for additional purchase price of up to million 
earnout payments of that amount would require average annual ebitda over the three years of more than million  and all earnout calculations are based upon a multiple of total purchase consideration to ebitda of approximately insignia s capital expenditure estimate for is approximately million  however  a substantial portion of this amount will be deferred until the company is reasonably comfortable that economic activity is increasing 
the company s capital expenditures for totaled approximately million excluding realty one s discontinued operation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company has adopted sfas no 
for all business combinations completed after july  and will fully implement sfas no 
and sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of amortization of goodwill that would become non amortizable under sfas no 
totaled approximately million for the year 
elimination of this amortization would have improved income by approximately million net of applicable taxes and diluted earnings per share by approximately for the company s initial impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets will be completed  with any measured impairment recorded through earnings as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  during the first quarter of insignia anticipates an aggregate impairment charge before tax effects of between million and million based on current industry multiples

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
insignia believes the following critical accounting policies affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s real estate services revenues are generally recorded when the related services are performed or at closing in the case of real estate sales 
prior to  leasing commission revenues were recorded when the related services were performed  generally at lease signing  unless significant contingencies existed 
with the adoption of sab in  the company was required to change its method of accounting for leasing commissions 
under sab  leasing commissions that are payable upon tenant occupancy  payment of rent or other events beyond the company s control are now recognized upon the occurrence of such events 
as certain conditions to revenue recognition for leasing commissions are outside of the company s control  judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events to recognition have occurred 
bad debts insignia maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of investments the company reviews each of its investments in unconsolidated real estate and internet entities on a quarterly basis for evidence of impairment 
impairment losses are recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate declines in value of such investments below carrying value and the related undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
in  the company recorded impairment losses of million on remaining internet investments and  on four real estate investments based on this evaluation 
in  insignia recorded internet impairment losses totaling million 
valuation of intangibles the company s intangible assets substantially consist of property management contracts and costs paid in excess of net assets of acquired businesses 
through december   the company used an undiscounted cash flow methodology to determine whether underlying operating cash flows were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of intangible assets 
beginning january   costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses will no longer be amortized but will be evaluated annually for impairment based on a reporting unit fair value approach as required by sfas in determining fair value of a reporting unit  the company relies on the application of generally accepted valuation approaches including an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach  which includes both comparisons to other comparable publicly traded businesses and searches of recent transactions involving similar businesses 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of operations of insignia in recent years and is not anticipated to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
insignia s exposure to market risk from changing prices consists primarily of fluctuations in rental rates of commercial and residential properties  market interest rates on residential mortgages and debt obligations  real estate property values and foreign currency fluctuations affecting operating results in europe  asia and latin america 
the revenues associated with the commercial services businesses are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates  lease rates  real property values and the availability of space and competition in the market place 
commercial service revenues are derived from a broad range of services that are primarily transaction driven and are therefore volatile in nature and highly competitive 
the revenues of the property management operations with respect to rental properties are highly dependent upon the aggregate rents of the properties managed  which are affected by rental rates and building occupancy rates 
rental rate increases are dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environments in the respective locations of the properties 
employee compensation is the principal cost element of property management 
changes in market interest rates and real property values impact the revenues of the company s new york based co op and condo brokerage and apartment leasing business 
economic trends in were characterized by general slowdowns in commercial leasing volume in the us and european markets and the erosion of new york residential sales volume  particularly at the high end of that market 
average sales prices for new york co op and condo sales declined from levels to  in  reflecting the higher percentage of sales at the low end of the pricing spectrum 
conversely  the effects of the weakening world economies did not adversely affect the company s commission fees earned on services 
nature of operations revenues from tenant representation  agency leasing  investment sales and residential brokerage  which collectively comprise a substantial portion of insignia s service revenues  are transactional in nature and therefore subject to seasonality and changes in business and capital market conditions 
a significant portion of the expenses associated with these transactional activities is directly correlated to revenue 
consistent with the industry in general  insignia s operating income and earnings have historically been lower during the first three calendar quarters than in the fourth quarter 
the reasons for the concentration of earnings in the fourth quarter include a general  industry wide focus on completing transactions by calendar year end  as well as the constant nature of the company s non variable expenses throughout the year versus the seasonality of its revenues 
this phenomenon has generally produced a historical pattern of higher revenues and income in the last half of the year and a gradual slowdown in transactional activity and corresponding operating results during the first quarter 
neither the nor years followed this typical seasonal pattern 
as evidence  second quarter of was abnormally robust and even surpassed the good third quarter of that year 
in  the company realized its best ever first quarter  yet produced much lower second and third quarters than the preceding year due to the effects of the global economic slowdown and the tragic events of september th 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons may be difficult to interpret 
in addition  market disruptions like that of the third quarter of can alter or increase the effect of normal seasonality 
finally  revenue recognition on lease commissions was changed as required by sab  and the company does not yet have sufficient experience with this accounting method to predict its impact on income seasonality 
the company plans its capital and operating expenditures based on its expectations of future revenues 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  the company may be unable to adjust expenditures to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
the company s business could suffer as a consequence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk the real estate market tends to be cyclical and related to the condition of the economy as a whole and to public perception of the economic outlook 
in addition  capital availability tends to also be cyclical  leading to periods of excess supply or shortages 
when supply is constrained or the economic outlook is poor  leasing and sales volumes may decline 
when capital is constrained or there is excess supply  property investment volume may decline 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  inflation or declining demand for real estate will adversely affect insignia s business and may cause  among other things i declines in leasing activity  ii declines in the availability of capital for investment in and mortgage financing for commercial real estate  iii declines in consumer demand for new york co ops and condominiums  and iv declines in rental rates and property values  with a commensurate decline in real estate service revenues 
insignia is exposed to a variety of market risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
in addition to the united states  the company conducts business in foreign jurisdictions throughout europe  asia and latin america 
however  currencies other than the british pound  euro and dollar have comprised less than of annual revenues 
on a pro forma basis  including the acquired groupe bourdais operation  of total service revenues and of net ebitda for the year ended december  were derived from european operations conducted using the pound or euro currencies 
because the pound and euro have declined over the last three years  the company s reported revenues and earnings have been adversely affected when translated to dollars 
continued changes in the value of such currencies against the us dollar will affect the company s reported results 
as evidence  only a change in the british pound and euro could have an annual impact of more than million on revenues and million on net earnings 
the company s residential brokerage and leasing business is affected by changes in the general level of market interest rates 
consumer buying habits related to co op and condo properties in new york are influenced to some degree by mortgage interest rates  particularly at the lower end of the spectrum of sales prices 
changes in interest rates also affect the interest earned on the company s cash and equivalents as well as interest paid on its debt 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
a basis point change in interest rates at average debt levels during would have affected interest expense for the year by approximately million
