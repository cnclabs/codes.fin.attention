pending acquisitions ibill on march   we signed an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of internet billing company  ltd 
and certain of its affiliate entities  or ibill 
ibill provides secure transaction services that enable web merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet 
ibill also manages back office functions including reporting  tracking  customer service and sales transactions 
ibill s service is powered by proprietary technology that integrates online payment processing  fraud control  affiliate management and financial reporting and tracking 
we agreed to pay ibill million in cash at closing  plus additional quarterly earnout payments for a period of six quarters ending december  the amount of each earnout payment depends on whether the acquired business achieves certain financial targets 
we have an option to buy out the remaining earnout obligation at any time by paying million per remaining quarter 
we are not required to close the ibill acquisition unless we receive necessary hart scott rodino approval 
if we terminate the acquisition agreement for anything other than the failure to obtain that approval or a severe service outage at ibill  we will be required to pay a termination fee of million to ibill 
we will pay the initial million portion of the purchase price by a using the remaining proceeds of our public offering of common stock and b drawing on our million credit facility 
epx on march   we entered into a binding letter agreement to acquire electronic payment exchange  inc  or epx 
epx is a full service electronic payment processing company that specializes in enabling businesses to accept credit card  debit card and electronic check payments 
epx s system provides straight through processing that eliminates a business s need to use a gateway or invest in front end technology to process transactions  whether the transactions take place online  over the telephone or at the point of sale 
under the terms of the letter agreement  we agreed to issue  shares of our common stock to epx s stockholders 
we will place of these shares in escrow for a period of eighteen months to secure epx s obligation to indemnify us for breaches of the representations and warranties 
upon disbursement of the escrow shares  we will issue additional shares of our common stock to the epx stockholders if the liabilities of epx at closing are less than million 
conversely  if epx s liabilities at closing are greater than million  we will reduce the escrow shares that would be otherwise disbursed to the epx stockholders

we expect to realize the following benefits from the acquisitions of ibill and epx o ability to offer end to end transaction processing services 
we will offer a single source end to end transaction processing solution  eliminating the need for businesses to establish multiple relationships o with banks  front end system providers  gateways  independent sales organizations and back end processing companies 
o expansion of merchant processing operations 
currently  our merchant processing division provides services to approximately community banks with over billion in transaction volume 
together  ibill and epx currently process approximately billion in annual transaction volume for both traditional brick and mortar companies and online merchants 
o expansion of transaction processing through multiple sales channels 
through an experienced sales force  we will offer our processing services through multiple sales channels  including internet  point of sale  call center  mail order and wireless channels 
o improved operating efficiencies 
we also intend to migrate to epx over time a portion of the processing of transactions that we currently broker through our existing merchant processing operation 
we believe this will enhance the margins of our combined business and leverage epx s capacity to handle additional transactions 
on march   we issued a press release announcing the ibill and epx acquisitions and updating our guidance for our financial performance in we expect the acquisitions of ibill and epx to increase our estimated revenues by million  and our estimated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  by to million 
after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments  we expect the acquisitions of ibill and epx to increase our estimated diluted earnings per share by 

ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with us gaap 
our market opportunity the financial services industry is currently undergoing a period of rapid change due to heightened competition and greater demand for new and convenient technology based banking services 
new competitors such as brokerage firms  affinity groups and internet banks are increasingly targeting traditional financial institutions most profitable customers 
to compete effectively and meet the demands of their customers  community financial institutions must continue to offer new services and integrate new technology and functionality into their operations 
us banks  including our target market of community financial institutions  increasingly view technology as critical to retaining and expanding their customer bases 
however  community financial institutions are often constrained by the design and capacity of their existing systems  limited in house technological resources and pressure to control operating costs 
as a result  we believe that community financial institutions will increasingly rely on third party providers like us to address their technology needs 
our solution our products and services help community financial institutions rapidly implement advanced technologies 
community financial institutions generally lack sufficient capital and human resources to internally develop and implement advanced technologies 
we offer numerous advanced technology products and services  including core data processing  eft services  check imaging software and data communications management  that community financial institutions need to run their businesses in today s competitive marketplace 
by using our products and services  community financial institutions can quickly gain access to advanced technologies and services they might not be able to develop and implement themselves 
focus on customer relationships 
we believe that community financial institutions can compete effectively with larger banks and succeed as independent institutions by remaining focused on serving the communities in which they operate 
typically  customers of community financial institutions rely on these financial institutions because of their ability to provide personalized  relationship based service and their focus on local community and business needs 
our products and services enable community financial institutions to focus on attracting  maintaining and expanding their customer relationships while satisfying demand for the latest financial products and services 
improve operating efficiencies 
by taking advantage of our technology and operating solutions  our customers can improve their operating efficiencies without allocating the expenses and resources necessary to develop or maintain similar systems themselves 
our customers get the benefit of our products and services without having to maintain personnel to develop  update and run these systems and without having to make large up front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies 
securely process and transmit large amounts of information 
our data communications network and management services facilitate the rapid  secure and reliable transmission and processing of the large amounts of sensitive data that our customers use in their operations 
this network utilizes the fiber optic networks of some of the largest telecommunications providers  and we link our network to our customers operations with high capacity communications lines 
this ensures that our data communications network will support the rapid processing and transmission of electronic data required to support our customers processing activities 
our strategies our goal is to become the leading provider of products and services for the technology and operating needs of community financial institutions in the united states by building and maintaining long term customer relationships to increase recurring revenues 
we seek to establish and maintain long term relationships with our customers and enter into contracts that typically extend for multiple years 
most of our products and services require the payment of monthly charges  which allows us to generate recurring revenues 
for the year ended december   recurring revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
emphasizing direct sales efforts and strategic marketing relationships to expand our customer base 
we plan to expand our customer base and penetrate new geographic markets by hiring sales personnel who are knowledgeable in banking technology products and services or have experience working with community financial institutions 
we also intend to continue to leverage our relationships with banking organizations such as bankers banks 
bankers banks are local or regional business organizations that provide banking products and services for financial institutions that cannot efficiently offer them due to cost  location  lack of resources or other circumstances 
in addition  bankers banks provide financial support to financial institutions and offer advice with respect to operations  profitability and federal and state regulation 
we have exclusive contractual marketing relationships with eight of the bankers banks in the united states regarding some or all of our products and services 
we also have relationships with four additional bankers banks  as well as other banking related organizations  which we leverage in our sales and marketing efforts 
our relationships with of the bankers banks give us access to more than  financial institutions in the united states 
we also seek to enter into other strategic partnerships that extend our customer reach and generate additional revenues 
in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with the bisys group  inc  one of the largest providers of financial technology services in the united states 
under the agreement  we serve as bisys preferred provider of outsourced check processing and imaging services to its customers 
in addition  in june  we entered into a joint marketing agreement with first national bank of omaha 
through this agreement  first national will promote our core processing services in kansas  colorado  nebraska and south dakota 
acquiring businesses with complementary products  services or relationships to enhance and expand our solutions  increase our market share or expand our geographic presence 
since our incorporation in  we have grown in part through selective acquisitions of other businesses and technologies 
we intend to continue to acquire other companies with complementary products  services or relationships to enhance and expand our offering and increase our market share 
we also plan to continue our expansion nationally through the acquisition of businesses that operate in geographic areas in which we do not currently have operations 
cross selling our products and services to our existing customer base to maximize our revenues 
once customers contract for one or more of our products or services  we are often able to increase revenues by providing additional products and services to them 
our products and services core data processing we provide products and services needed to meet our customers core processing requirements  including general ledger  loan and deposit operations  financial accounting and reporting and customer information file maintenance 
our products and services provide superior flexibility and improve customer service throughout the financial institution

the need to reduce labor  research time and the cost of postage has increased the demand for check imaging solutions on both an in house and service bureau basis 
check imaging involves creating digital images through the use of a camera attached to a sorter 
as each check passes through the sorter  the camera takes its picture 
images of insufficient checks  stop payments and large dollar checks are presented online to bank operations staff for review 
financial institutions employ check imaging as part of their efforts to reduce operating costs and provide enhanced banking services to their customers 
our check imaging capabilities include category description renaissance imaging o delivers a comprehensive suite of check imaging products  including front and back imaging for customer statements  clearing and settlement  reconciliation and automated exception processing o prints multiple check images in check sequence on a single page for inclusion in monthly statements to reduce postage costs when mailing to the banks customers o operates in either microsoft r or novell r network environments utilizing oracle r database technology o allows bank employees to retrieve imaged checks on personal computers to facilitate signature verification and speed responses to customer inquiries o allows corporate customers to receive periodic statement information on cd rom to facilitate financial and cash management objectives service bureau o turnkey outsourced solution for check imaging activities that provides our customers the ability to offer check imaging without a large capital expenditure o check imaging centers located in states as of december  o each center serves as a back up facility in the event another center experiences a natural disaster  destruction or other similar event which eliminates or diminishes its processing capabilities electronic funds transfer we believe that increased use and acceptance of atm and debit cards  coupled with technological advances in electronic transaction processing  have created a need for financial service providers to offer a wide variety of eft solutions to their customers 
by aggregating the eft transaction processing of numerous financial institutions  we create economies of scale that allow our customers to price their services competitively 
the typical atm transaction that we process begins when a cardholder inserts a card issued by a financial institution into an atm to withdraw funds  obtain a balance  make other account inquiries or transfer funds 
the transaction is routed from the atm across our frame relay network to our data communications and processing center in norcross  georgia 
we then either a authorize or deny the requested transaction or b direct the transaction to the card issuer or its designated processor for authorization 
once authorization is received  the authorization message is routed back to the atm almost immediately and the transaction is completed 
we update the account information of our customers cardholders on a daily basis 
the debit card transaction process begins when a consumer presents a debit card to a merchant who swipes the card at a point of sale terminal and enters the transaction amount 
the transaction data is transmitted from the point of sale terminal through the applicable processing networks to our frame relay network 
the data is then routed across our network to our data communications and processing center in norcross  georgia 
we then a compare the purchase transaction against the authorization data accessed through our system  b place a hold for the transaction amount  c authorize or deny the transaction and d transmit the authorization response almost immediately back through the network to the point of sale terminal 
the appropriate processing network settles the payment and credits the merchant with the transaction amount less any discounts 
the merchant delivers final transaction information to the processing network  and the network submits the transaction to us  which facilitates posting and reporting of the transaction with the bank that issued the debit card 
to complete the transaction  the bank that issued the debit card debits its customer s account for the transaction amount

we anticipate that  as revenues from our other operations increase  revenues from supplying equipment and maintenance and technical support services will decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
we provide merchant portfolio management services  which are designed to reduce labor intensive back office functions for our customers 
we can provide these services at a lower cost than many banks incur in house by streamlining processes and taking advantage of economies of scale 
our customer service and technical support departments provide coverage hours a day  seven days a week 
we believe that well trained support personnel are essential to attract and retain financial institution customers

in addition  we offer internet banking and voice response products through netzee 
see our relationship with netzee below 
merchant processing as noted above in pending acquisitions  we have agreed to acquire ibill and epx 
ibill provides secure transaction services that enable web merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet 
ibill also manages back office functions including reporting  tracking  customer service and sales transactions 
ibill s service is powered by proprietary technology that integrates online payment processing  fraud control  affiliate management and financial reporting and tracking 
epx is a full service electronic payment processing company that specializes in enabling businesses to accept credit card  debit card and electronic checkpayments 
epx s system provides straight through processing that eliminates a business s need to use a gateway or invest in front end technology to process transactions  whether the transactions take place online  over the telephone or at the point of sale 
we already process transactions through our existing merchant processing operation that has essentially served as a middleman between the merchant customers of our financial institution customers and other transaction processors 
if we acquire both ibill and epx as we expect  we intend to move to epx a portion of the processing of transactions that ibill currently sends to other transaction processors 
we also intend to migrate to epx over time a portion of the processing of transactions that we currently broker through our existing merchant processing operation 
we believe this will enhance the margins of our combined business and leverage epx s ability to handle additional transactions 
our relationship with netzee we offer internet banking and voice response products through netzee and we own approximately of netzee s common stock 
two of our directors currently serve as directors and are significant shareholders of netzee 
one of those directors  donny r 
jackson  was our president until october and is currently the chief executive officer of netzee 
additionally  john w 
collins  our chairman and chief executive officer  is the chairman of the board of directors of netzee 
we maintain a strategic relationship with netzee to cross market each other s products and services 
our existing and future agreements and relationships with netzee have not resulted and will not necessarily result from arm s length negotiations 
when the interests of netzee diverge from our interests  netzee s officers and directors may exercise their influence in netzee s best interests 
therefore  our agreements and relationships with netzee may be less favorable to us than those that we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
moreover  many of the transactions between netzee and us do not lend themselves to precise allocations of costs and benefits 
thus  the value of these transactions will be left to the discretion of the parties  who are subject to potentially conflicting interests 
we provide to netzee  jointly with john h 
harland company  an million revolving line of credit secured by substantially all of netzee s assets 
of the total amount available to netzee  we provide approximately million and harland provides approximately million on a pro rata basis with us provided that we are obligated to advance the last million without harland s participation 
the netzee line of credit matures on april  the line of credit bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus  and accrued interest is payable monthly 
as of december   netzee owed us million for our advances under the line of credit 
if netzee does not become profitable or has any additional adverse events  it may not be able to repay the loans we have made and may make to it in the future 
as of december   the book value of our investment in netzee was million  which is less than the market value of million as of that date 
effective february   we acquired the business of dpsc from netzee for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of dpsc s net liabilities 
netzee used approximately million of the cash proceeds to reduce its borrowings on its line of credit with us 
sales and marketing at december   our sales force was made up of sales representatives and product specialists who sell all of our products and services to our customers in specified geographic regions 
because they have the ability to sell our full range of products and services  our sales representatives can capitalize on their relationships with community financial institutions 
although the sales representatives are trained on each product line  we also employ several product specialists who are available to assist the direct salesperson in the specifics of certain technical products 
we offer products and services on both a stand alone basis and in combination with one or more of our products and services 
if we complete our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx as we anticipate  we will add approximately sales representatives and product specialists to our combined operations 
our indirect marketing efforts include obtaining referrals and endorsements from our customers and various banking related organizations 
we currently have exclusive marketing agreements with eight of the bankers banks and have other relationships with four additional bankers banks 
through our relationship with these bankers banks  we have referral sources to thousands of financial institutions nationwide 
in may  we entered into a strategic alliance with bisys  one of the largest providers of financial technology services in the united states 
under the agreement  we serve as bisys preferred provider of outsourced check processing and imaging services to its customers 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
of these employees  worked in operations  in administration and in sales 
none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement nor have we ever experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory 
if we complete our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx as we anticipate  we will add approximately employees to our combined operations 
government regulation our banking customers are subject to the supervision of several state and federal government regulatory agencies 
in addition  various federal and state regulatory agencies examine our data processing operations from time to time 
these agencies can make findings or recommendations regarding various aspects of our operations  and we generally must follow these recommendations to continue our data processing operations 
our atm network operations are subject to federal regulations governing consumers rights 
fees charged by atm owners are currently regulated in several states  and legislation regulating atm fees has been proposed in several other states 
additional legislation may be proposed and enacted in the future or existing consumer protection laws may be expanded to apply to atm fees 
if the number of atms decreases  then our eft revenues may decline 
furthermore  we are subject to the regulations and policies of various atm and debit card associations and networks 
beginning july   financial institutions are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the gramm leach bliley act 
these regulations place restrictions on financial institutions use of non public personal information 
all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties 
the new regulations  however  permit financial institutions to share information with non affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions 
as a provider of services to community financial institutions  we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 
competition the market for companies that provide technology solutions to community financial institutions is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  and we expect increased competition from both existing competitors and companies that enter our existing or future markets 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our services include price  quality and reliability of service  degree of service integration  ease of use and service features 
numerous companies supply competing products and services  and many of these companies specialize in one or more of the services that we offer or intend to offer to our customers 
in our core banking and data processing business  we compete with several national and regional companies including fiserv  inc  jack henry associates  inc 
and bisys 
our principal eft competitors include regional atm networks  regional and local banks that perform processing functions  non bank processors and other independent technology and data communications organizations including concord efs  inc and electronic data systems corporation 
in our check imaging and processing business  we compete with a number of national and regional companies including advanced financial solutions  inc and wausau financial systems  inc 
if we complete our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx as we anticipate  we will be subject to competition from large merchant processors like chase merchant systems  national processing  paymentech  us bancorp  first data  concord efs and others 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights none of our technology is currently patented  although ibill has patent applications pending for its technology 
instead  we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will adequately protect our proprietary rights or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
item properties

item legal proceedings 
other than as described in this paragraph  we are not a party to  and none of our material properties is subject to  any material litigation other than routine litigation incidental to our business 
on march   we brought an action against midwest payment systems  inc mps in the us district court in the eastern district of tennessee 
mps provides eft atm services to customers that we obtained through our purchase of le vickers and associates  inc we notified mps in november that we would not renew our contract with it to provide eft atm services to the vickers customers and that we would move those customers to our own system 
mps responded to this letter by claiming  among other things  that a it has a right of first refusal to continue to provide services to those customers and b if we did not continue to use mps services  we would owe mps damages 
mps has also informed several of the vickers customers that they must pay damages to mps if they do not continue receiving eft atm services from it and we believe it has told some customers that they will have to sign new contracts with mps to continue receiving these services 
in the lawsuit  we have sought a temporary restraining order requiring mps to cease its attempts to induce the customer banks to enter into contracts with mps for eft atm services 
we have also asked the court for a declaration as to the rights and legal relations of intercept  mps and the customer banks under the contracts that we and the banks have with mps 
mps has not answered our complaint

in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recorded corresponding gains to reflect the increase in the value of the shares of netzee that it owned  which are included in investment in affiliate on our balance sheet 
because these gains are not taxable until realized  we recorded a deferred tax liability on our balance sheet to reflect the amount of estimated tax that would be owed upon sale of the shares 
since its initial public offering  netzee has reported operating losses 
because we used the equity method to account for our investment in netzee  we recorded our proportionate share of netzee s losses as a reduction to investment in affiliate  which reduced the book value of the investment in netzee 
as we recorded our equity in those losses  a deferred tax benefit should have been recorded as a reduction against the deferred tax liability recorded previously

overview we derive revenues primarily from the following sources service fees for o core data processing and check imaging systems  support  maintenance and related services and software sales o eft processing services data communications management equipment and product sales  services and other o sales of banking related equipment and complementary products o equipment maintenance and technical support services o related products and services 
in our service bureau operations  we generate core data processing revenues from service and processing fees based primarily on the asset base of our financial institution customers  the number of transactions we process and the number of accounts we service 
we recognize these revenues as we perform the services 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our core data processing systems 
we recognize revenues for licensing these systems in accordance with statement of position on software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we recognize software license fees when we have signed a non cancelable license agreement  shipped the product and satisfied significant obligations to the customer 
we license renaissance imaging tm check imaging software on an in house basis  and we generate revenues from up front license fees and recurring annual maintenance fees charged for this system 
we recognize revenues from the licensing of renaissance imaging in accordance with statement of position  as discussed above 
we also provide check processing and imaging in a service bureau environment under which we generate recurring revenues 
on a service bureau basis  we generate revenues based on the volume of items processed 
we recognize this revenue as we provide the service 
we derive eft revenues principally from processing atm and debit card transactions 
we receive a base fee for providing our atm processing services and an additional fee for each additional atm serviced 
once the number of transactions by a financial institution exceeds established levels  typically between  and  transactions per month  we charge additional fees for these transactions 
for debit card transactions  we currently receive a portion of the interchange fees generated by our financial institution customers  and we charge a monthly fee if our customers do not meet a specified minimum dollar amount of transactions for a particular month 
during the second quarter of  we will begin implementation of a new debit card pricing structure  under which we will receive a fee for each transaction processed 
under the new pricing  we will not receive a portion of the interchange fee for processing debit card transactions 
we believe that this new pricing structure  once fully implemented  will not materially change our revenues from debit card processing and that it will materially reduce our exposure to any changes in interchange fees that may be implemented by visa and mastercard 
most charges due under our eft service agreements are due and paid monthly 
we generate our data communications management service revenues principally from network management and from equipment configuration services and installation 
we charge an installation fee and a regular monthly fee on an ongoing basis for providing telecommunications connectivity and network management 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment and complementary products at the time of shipment 
we recognize maintenance and technical support service revenues as we provide the service 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues were recurring revenues 
recurring revenues result from regular monthly payments by our customers for ongoing services used in connection with their business 
these revenues do not include conversion or deconversion fees  initial software license fees  installation fees  hardware sales or similar activities 
we offer internet banking and voice response products through netzee 
we own approximately of netzee s outstanding common stock 
we account for our investment in netzee under the equity method  which requires us to record netzee s results of operations in a single line item in our statement of operations titled equity in loss of affiliate 
until september  however  we owned a majority of netzee s then outstanding common stock 
our ownership percentage in netzee decreased to approximately as of september  because of netzee s issuance of its common stock in connection with transactions that occurred on that date 
as a result  we discontinued consolidating netzee s results of operations with our results of operations 
because we provided unlimited funding to netzee through the completion of its initial public offering in november  all of netzee s losses before the completion of the offering were included in that line item rather than our relative percentage of those losses 
since netzee completed its initial public offering  we record only our relative percentage of netzee s net losses 
in february  we completed a public offering of common stock 
our proceeds from this offering  after deducting expenses related to the offering  were approximately million 
we used the proceeds of this offering to repay certain debt and fund our acquisitions completed in and and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in august  we completed the advanced computer enterprises acquisition  which we accounted for as a pooling of interests 
except for the august acquisition  we have accounted for all of our acquisitions since our initial public offering as purchase transactions in our financial statements 
on january   we acquired the us core data processing  check imaging and item processing operations  as well as the bancline software  from slm 
we paid million in cash and issued or agreed to issue up to approximately million shares of our common stock in the transaction  including up to  shares that represent contingent consideration 
as of december    of the contingent shares had been earned and  shares will never be earned 
effective february   we acquired from netzee the asset liability and regulatory reporting software of dpsc for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of dpsc s net liabilities 
netzee used approximately million of the cash proceeds to reduce its line of credit with us 
in august and september  we completed another public offering of common stock 
proceeds to us from this offering including the over allotment option after deducting expenses related to the offering were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds of this offering to pay certain debt and expect to use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes  to fund future acquisitions particularly our pending acquisition of ibill and to fulfill our obligations under our revolving line of credit to netzee 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of holmes and shaw  inc and superior forms  ltd 
together  hsi 
based in san antonio  texas  hsi is a full service provider of computer output solutions including data processing  laser document printing  and automated mailing services 
consideration for this purchase was approximately million cash and assumed liabilities 
we also completed three other acquisitions during  for which we paid a total of million  net  in cash 
one of the agreements includes  in contingent consideration that will be paid and recorded as purchase price consideration if and when the contingencies are resolved 
as noted in item  business pending acquisitions  we announced after the close of trading on the nasdaq stock market on march  a major expansion in our merchant processing operations 
we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of internet billing company  ltd  a ft 
lauderdale based provider of transaction processing for web merchants 
separately  we also signed a binding letter agreement to acquire electronic payment exchange  inc  a provider of transaction processing services based in new castle  delaware 
if we close these acquisitions as we anticipate  they will increase our revenues and earnings 
we will have to use a substantial portion of our capital resources to close these acquisitions and integrate them into our businesses 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our expectations of future revenues 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to reduce spending quickly if our actual revenues are lower than we expect 
to enhance our long term competitive position  we may also make decisions regarding pricing  marketing  services and technology that could have an adverse near term effect on our financial condition and operating results 
because of the foregoing factors and other risk factors discussed in this report  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our operating results are likely to fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps significantly 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the indicated periods 
year ended december  revenues costs of services selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before provision benefit for income taxes  equity in loss of affiliate and minority interest provision benefit for income taxes equity in loss of affiliate minority interest net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily related to a million generated by an increase in service fee income  b million generated by an increase in data communications management income and c  generated by additional hardware sales 
these increases are attributable to both internal growth and acquisitions 
the revenue growth is primarily due to volume increases rather than price increases as price increases are generally limited to cpi increases 
costs of services 
costs of services increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to a an increase of million related to service fee income b million related to data communications management  and c  generated by additional hardware sales 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisitions of slm and hsi  which had gross margins which were less than intercept s historical gross margin percentages 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to additional personnel  facilities and infrastructure to support our growth and acquisitions and other miscellaneous expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   which was attributable to a increased leverage in our business model and b the acquisitions of slm and hsi  which had lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than intercept 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income 
for the foregoing reasons  operating income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from income of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily because we recognized a  gain related to the increase in our investment value in netzee for the year ended december  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 compared to an million gain of that nature in provision benefit for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  excluding the tax benefit recorded on the equity in losses of netzee was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in rate is mainly due to state tax planning initiatives implemented in equity in loss of affiliate 
equity in loss of affiliate was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this amount represents our share of netzee s losses 
minority interest 
minority interest in income decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced profits in proimage s operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily related to a million generated by an increase in service fee income  b  generated by an increase in data communications management income and c  generated by additional hardware sales 
these increases are attributable to both internal growth and acquisitions 
costs of services 
costs of services increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to a an increase of million related to service fee income b  related to data communications management  and c  generated by additional hardware sales 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to additional personnel we hired to support our growth and acquisitions and other miscellaneous expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization remained constant at million for the years ended december  and during intercept had a one time amortization charge related to netzee of approximately million  which was offset by increased intangibles in operating income 
for the foregoing reasons  operating income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from income of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily because we recognized only an million gain related to the increase in our investment value in netzee for the year ended december  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 compared to a million gain of that nature in this decrease was partially offset by interest income of million from investments of the proceeds from our public offering of stock in february for an explanation of the netzee gain  see note to our financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  excluding the tax benefit recorded on the equity in losses of netzee was as compared to for the year ended december  the tax provision in was higher due to the effect of permanent basis differences  including goodwill 
equity in loss of affiliate 
equity in loss of affiliate was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this amount represents our share of netzee losses 
minority interest 
minority interest decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced profits in proimage s operations 
liquidity and capital resources since our incorporation  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash from operations  borrowings from banks and sales of our common stock 
our initial public offering in june resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
we raised million through a public offering of common stock in february and an additional million through another public offering of common stock in august and september cash and cash equivalents were million at december  short term investments with a maturity of one year or less were million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in earnings and depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in earnings  excluding the non cash effects of our investment in netzee 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in net cash used for investing activities in as compared to relates to cash paid for acquisitions and additional loans to netzee and slm 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in as compared to was attributable to investment of the proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in september as well as increased capital expenditures and acquisitions during similarly  the increase in net cash used in investing activities in as compared to was attributable to investment of the proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in february as well as increased capital expenditures and acquisitions during net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash generated for compared to is due to the net proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in september of million  offset by repayments of borrowings under our credit facility using a portion of the offering proceeds 
similarly  the increase in net cash generated for compared to is due to the net proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in february of million  offset by repayments of borrowings under our credit facility using a portion of the offering proceeds 
together with john h 
harland company  we provide a revolving line of credit to netzee 
on march  we amended this facility to reduce the total amount of credit available and to extend the termination date to april  we currently provide to netzee an million revolving line of credit secured by substantially all of netzee s assets 
of the total million available to netzee  we provide approximately million and harland provides approximately million on a pro rata basis with us provided that we are obligated to advance the last million without harland s participation 
in february  we paid netzee million in cash and assumed million of dpsc s net liabilities in exchange for regulatory reporting software and other assets formerly owned by netzee s subsidiary  dpsc 
netzee has subsequently borrowed additional funds from us  and as of december   netzee owed us a total of million under this line of credit including accrued interest of approximately  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at prime plus 
total interest on all borrowings for and was approximately million and million  respectively 
we finance this line of credit with cash on hand and additional borrowings under our credit facility with first union 
netzee may require additional funds to support its operations and to repay its borrowings from us 
netzee may seek to raise capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity  the sale of assets or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on terms favorable to netzee  if at all 
netzee s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they come due may depend upon its ability to raise additional capital funds 
on may   we entered into a loan agreement with slm under which we loaned slm million subject to various terms and conditions 
borrowings under the loan agreement bore interest at an annual rate equal to the one month libor plus and were secured by up to approximately million shares of our common stock then held or that may be earned by slm 
the loan was scheduled to mature on december  on august   slm repaid the loan  including accrued interest  in full from the net proceeds of slm s sale of  shares of our common stock in our public offering closed on that date 
on december   we entered into a loan agreement with slm under which we agreed to lend slm million subject to various terms and conditions 
borrowings under the loan agreement bear interest  payable upon maturity  at the prime rate and are secured by up to  shares of intercept common stock that slm now holds or may earn 
the loan matures on september  and requires mandatory prepayments from the proceeds of sales of our common stock by slm until the loan is repaid in full 
during  we entered into an amended and restated credit facility with first union national bank 
under this facility we may borrow up to million for working capital and to fund acquisitions and related expenses 
the first union credit facility contains provisions that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth amounts and which restrict our ability to incur additional debt  make certain capital expenditures  enter into agreements for mergers  acquisitions or the sale of substantial assets and pay dividends 
this credit facility matures on june  interest is payable monthly  and outstanding principal amounts accrue interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to either a a floating rate equal to the lender s prime rate minus or b a fixed rate based upon the day libor rate plus applicable margins 
on december   the interest rate under this facility was approximately per year  and approximately  was outstanding under this facility 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions in and through the use of cash on hand and borrowings under our line of credit with first union national bank 
in the second quarter of  we anticipate using a substantial portion of the capital resources available to us to fund the million purchase price of ibill and up to million of immediate working capital needs of epx 
to provide the approximately million in cash we need for these purposes  we intend to draw on our first union credit facility and use the remaining net proceeds from our public offering of common stock 
as a result  our operating cash flows will be our principal source of short term liquidity 
accordingly  we are unlikely to make any additional acquisitions that require a material amount of cash until we raise additional capital 
we believe that to the extent that we rely on cash flows from operations to meet our short term funding requirements  a decrease in demand for our products and services would not result in a material reduction in the availability of those funds 
because most of our customer contracts require the payment of monthly charges and have original terms of three to five years  we have a high percentage of recurring revenues 
we believe that  other than our need for cash to fund our pending acquisitions  funds to be provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital expenditures and liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to grow  in part  through strategic acquisitions 
assuming we are able to raise additional capital  we expect to make additional expenditures to make acquisitions and integrate the acquired companies 
we can give no assurances with respect to the actual timing and amount of the capital we raise or of the acquisitions we may make with the capital so raised 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we will complete any acquisitions on terms favorable to us  if at all  or that additional sources of financing will be available to us 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments and affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues include service fees  data communication management fees  equipment sales  installation and maintenance  software license fees  and software maintenance 
we recognize service fee income and data communication management fees as services are performed 
we recognize revenue from equipment sales and installations upon installation of the product  and any related maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our core data processing systems 
we recognize revenue for licensing these systems in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
software license  hardware  and installation revenue is recognized after we have a signed non cancelable license agreement  have installed the products  and have fulfilled all significant obligations to the customer 
maintenance fees are recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we sell certain of our software and hardware products under five year  sales type lease agreements through which customers pay five equal advance payments 
these leases incorporate the initial installation and ongoing license fee for five years 
revenue for all lease agreements  with the exception of revenue attributable to equipment  which is recognized upon installation  is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the lease 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivables balances 
we develop estimates by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss as well as historical credit memo data and other known factors for billing disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations carried out by us require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business 
in general  we determine the fair value based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets 
these assets are being amortized over the expected economic lives of the assets  generally ranging from to years 
if we determine that we have over estimated the economic life of these assets  we will begin to amortize the remaining unamortized carrying value of the assets over the newly estimated life 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense could be increased  and the amount of any increase could be material to our results of operations 
we also recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with our acquisitions 
through the end of  we evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever indicators of impairment existed based on undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the goodwill was less than the undiscounted projected future cash flows  no impairment would be recognized 
beginning january   we adopted a recently issued accounting standard that requires us to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation will be based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the unit of our business to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation will be estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit 
these cash flow projections will be based on a number of assumptions as discussed above 
if a change in estimate of fair value occurs after one year of the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations 
to date  we have not recorded an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets 
we believe that assumptions we have made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet our expectations  we may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations 
investment in and advances to netzee we currently own approximately of netzee s common stock 
we account for our investment in netzee using the equity method of accounting  under which the operations of netzee are recorded on a single line item in our statements of operations  equity in loss of affiliate 
we do not consolidate netzee s results of operations with our results of operations 
because we provided unlimited funding to netzee until the completion of their initial public offering in november  all of netzee s losses prior to the completion of the offering are included in that line item rather than our relative percentage of those losses 
following the completion of the initial public offering  we have recorded only our relative percentage of netzee s net losses 
during and  netzee issued shares of common stock at a price above book value 
as a result  we increased our investment in netzee and recorded gains to reflect the increase in the value of our investment 
we then decreased our investment for our portion of netzee s losses described above 
we review our investment in netzee in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
apb opinion no 
provides that a loss in value of an investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized 
we compare our carrying value of the investment to the fair market value of the stock over time in order to determine when a loss in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
as of december   our investment in netzee was million 
the corresponding fair market value of our shares of netzee s common stock was approximately million  and thus we concluded that our investment was not impaired 
additionally  we have evaluated the business and financial projections of netzee and have concluded  based on our review  that the amounts due from netzee are collectible 
therefore  we have not established a reserve for the note as of december  relationship with netzee intercept and netzee maintain a relationship to cross market each other s products and services 
during and  we received  and  respectively  in commissions related to netzee sales 
we also shared certain facilities with netzee and provided certain administrative services to netzee 
we charged netzee approximately  and  in and  respectively  for these shared costs 
during and  netzee used us to purchase certain hardware and software used to implement netzee s internet and telephone banking products 
in addition  we assisted netzee in managing the ordering and inventory process related to this equipment 
during and  netzee incurred approximately  and  respectively  in costs to purchase the equipment  which included a fee to us for their services 
relationship with slm we provide telecommunications network and operations services and customer support services to slm  as well as computer programming services 
we recorded revenue of approximately million related to services provided to slm in we also charged slm approximately  during for rent and building expenses related to certain slm operations maintained at intercept s facility 
we have made two loans to slm as described above in liquidity and capital resources and one of those loans remains outstanding 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this annual report 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that they will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements include assumptions as to how we may perform in the future 
when we use words like believe  expect  anticipate  predict  project  potential  seek  continue  will  may  could  intend  plan  pro forma  estimate  goal  strive and similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable  but we cannot be sure that we will actually achieve these expectations 
projections or estimates of our future performance are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and may vary materially from actual results 
in evaluating forward looking statements  you should carefully consider various factors discussed below 
some of the following risks will apply to us only if we close our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx as we expect 
please see in particular the risks under the heading risks related to our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx 
although we anticipate closing both acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will in fact do so 
if we do not complete the acquisitions of ibill and epx for any reason  these particular risks will not apply to us  but our failure to close the acquisitions may have adverse consequences for us 
for example  the price of our common stock may decline if the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that we will complete these acquisitions 
in addition  our failure to close these acquisitions after having announced them may negatively affect our ability and prospects for consummating acquisitions in the future 
also  we have already incurred substantial costs related to these acquisitions that we must pay even if we do not close the acquisitions 
risks related to our operations our rapid growth could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  and our failure to manage our growth could cause our business to suffer 
our internal growth and acquisitions since our initial public offering in june have placed great demands on our business  particularly our managerial  operational and financial personnel and systems 
for example  we have grown from approximately employees on march  to approximately  employees on march  if we close the ibill and epx transactions as we anticipate  we will add approximately employees 
additional internal growth and acquisitions may further strain our resources 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures  controls and existing facilities will be adequate to support the expansion of our operations  while maintaining adequate levels of customer service and satisfaction 
our future operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
our failure to respond to and manage changing business conditions as we expand could diminish the quality of our products and services  result in the loss of customers and weaken our operating results 
our acquisitions could result in integration difficulties  unexpected expenses  diversion of management s attention and other negative consequences 
as part of our growth strategy  we have made numerous acquisitions since our initial public offering in june  and we have two significant pending acquisitions 
we plan to continue to acquire complementary businesses  products and services as a key element of our growth strategy 
we must integrate the technology  products and services  operations  systems and personnel of acquired businesses with our own and attempt to grow the acquired businesses as part of our company 
the integration of other businesses is a complex process and places significant demands on our management  financial  technical and other resources 
the successful integration of businesses we have acquired in the past  are currently in the process of acquiring and may acquire in the future  is critical to our future success 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these businesses  our financial and operating performance could suffer 
the risks and challenges associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses include o we may be unable to centralize and consolidate our financial  operational and administrative functions with those of the businesses we acquire  o our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  o we may be unable to retain and motivate key employees of an acquired company  o we may enter markets in which we have little or no prior direct experience  o litigation  indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses  o the costs necessary to complete integration may exceed our expectations or outweigh some of the intended benefits of the transactions we complete  o we may be unable to maintain the customers or goodwill of an acquired business  and o the costs necessary to improve or replace the operating systems  products and services of acquired businesses may exceed our expectations 
we may be unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our operations on schedule or at all 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur large accounting charges or other expenses in connection with acquisitions or that acquisitions will result in cost savings or sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or our expenses related to  these acquisitions 
if we do not continue to expand our sales force and our marketing relationships  we may be unable to continue our growth 
our ability to expand our business will depend significantly upon our ability to expand our sales and marketing force and our strategic marketing relationships 
competition for experienced sales and marketing personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our existing personnel or locate and attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  if we lose any of the relationships with various banking related organizations for the marketing and endorsement of our products and services or are unable to enter into new ones  growth in our customer base and revenues could be impaired 
competition may impede our ability to acquire other businesses and may inhibit our growth 
a significant part of our historic growth has been generated by acquisitions 
we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished through acquisitions 
the success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  reach agreements to acquire these companies and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities  we may compete with other companies that have similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
this competition may render us unable to acquire businesses that could improve our growth or expand our operations 
if our stock price drops  our ability to acquire other businesses will be impaired 
we have financed the acquisitions we have completed since our initial public offering with a combination of our common stock  cash from common stock offerings  cash from our operations and borrowings made under our line of credit with first union 
if our stock price declines as a result of general market conditions or otherwise  the shareholders of businesses that we seek to acquire may be unwilling to accept our common stock in exchange for their businesses 
in that case  we would be required to use larger portions of our line of credit or cash from operations to continue to complete acquisitions  which would decrease our working capital and increase our interest expense 
this could have a material negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations 
our credit facility with first union restricts our ability to complete acquisitions without first union s consent 
we must comply with the financial and other covenants of the credit facility to be able to draw on our credit facility to fund our acquisitions 
in addition first union must approve any acquisition by us which has a purchase price in excess of million 
if we are unable to borrow funds under our credit line  we may be unable to make acquisitions that could be helpful to our business 
the loss of our chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
john w 
collins  our chief executive officer  has substantial experience with our operations and our industry and has contributed significantly to our growth 
although we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
collins and he works for us under the terms of an employment agreement  our customer and marketing relationships would likely be impaired and our business would likely suffer if we lost the services of mr 
collins for any reason 
if our processing centers or communications network suffers a systems failure or interruption  we may face customer service issues and be liable for damage suffered by our customers 
our operations depend upon our ability to protect our processing centers  network infrastructure and equipment 
damage to our systems or equipment or those of third parties that we use may be caused by natural disasters  human error  power and telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although we do have data and item processing centers in several locations that serve as back ups for each other  we maintain only a single data communications switching facility and do not maintain a back up location for our frame relay network hardware 
interruption in our processing or communications services could delay transfers of our customers data  or damage or destroy the data 
sudden increases in atm usage or debit card activity could result in slow response times in our network 
any of these occurrences could result in lawsuits or loss of customers  and may also harm our reputation 
we depend on other providers for products and services necessary to our business  and if we cannot obtain satisfactory products and services on favorable terms  or at all  our business could suffer 
we rely on other providers for internet and telephone banking products and services  atm and debit card manufacturing  fiber optic communications and other products and services that are essential to our business 
for example  we use and market the internet and telephone banking services of our affiliate  netzee 
if netzee or any of our other providers terminates or changes its relationship with us  or if for any reason we are unable to obtain its products and services on favorable terms  we may be unable to meet our customers needs on a timely basis 
similarly  if any of these providers is permanently or temporarily unable to provide its products and services to us as the result of natural disasters  technical difficulties or otherwise  we may be unable to provide our products and services to our customers 
if the performance of these third party products and services does not meet our customers expectations  it may damage our current customer relationships  harm our reputation and inhibit our ability to obtain new customers 
if our products and services contain errors  we may lose customers and revenues and be subject to claims for damages 
our new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services may have undetected errors or failures  or could fail to achieve market acceptance  despite testing by our current and potential customers and by us 
if we discover errors after we have introduced a new or updated product to the marketplace  we could experience  among other things o delayed or lost revenues while we correct the errors  o a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance  and o additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development 
our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
these provisions may not be effective because of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances  or unfavorable judicial decisions 
if our products and services fail to function properly  we could be subject to product liability claims  which could result in increased litigation expense  damage awards and harm to our business reputation 
because our business involves the electronic storage and transmission of data  security breaches and computer viruses could adversely affect us 
our online transaction processing systems electronically store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers 
the difficulty of securely storing confidential information electronically has been a significant issue in conducting electronic transactions 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  such as banking records or credit information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us  and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 
technological changes may reduce the demand for our products and services or render them obsolete 
the introduction of new technologies and financial products and services can render existing technology products and services obsolete 
we expect other vendors to continually introduce new products and services  as well as enhancements to their existing products and services  that will compete with our products and services 
to be successful  we must anticipate evolving industry trends  continue to apply advances in technology  enhance our existing products and services and develop or acquire new products and services to meet the demands of our customers 
we may not be successful in developing  acquiring or marketing new or enhanced products or services that respond to technological change or evolving customer needs 
we may also incur substantial costs in developing and employing new technologies 
if we fail to adapt to changes in technologies  we could lose customers and revenues  and fail to attract new customers or otherwise realize the benefits of costs we incur 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
we attempt to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we cannot be sure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we could be liable for significant damages 
we do not believe that any of intercept s products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be sure  however  that third parties will not make infringement claims  and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those claims 
we have recently discovered that epl  inc  which sells software and services to credit unions  has filed a trademark registration application with the united states patent and trademark office for the name tellerplus 
the epl mark and registration could adversely affect our use of the mark tellerplus with respect to banks 
we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of products and services increases and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any of those claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 
fluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 
our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of many factors 
these factors include o the possible negative impact of implementing our growth and acquisition strategies  including accounting charges and other expenses associated with our acquisitions  o the loss of customers or strategic relationships  o competition and pricing pressures  o a reduction in recurring revenues as a percentage of total revenues  o increased operating expenses due to launches of new products and services  and sales and marketing efforts  and o changes in interchange and transaction fees of mastercard r and visa r 
many factors that affect our operating results are outside of our control 
because of these factors  it is likely that in some future period our financial results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps significantly 
if we fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions  our business could be harmed 
as a provider of services to community financial institutions  we are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed on financial institutions 
we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could damage our customer relationships  harm our reputation and inhibit our ability to obtain new customers 
our limited combined operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
since our incorporation in may we have completed numerous acquisitions  including several acquisitions in the financial information included in this annual report is based in part on the separate pre acquisition financial results of the companies we have acquired 
as a result  your evaluation of us is based on a limited combined operating history 
our historical results of operations and our other financial information may not give you an accurate indication of our future results of operations or prospects 
risks related to our ownership in netzee because we own a minority interest in netzee and netzee is expected to continue to have significant losses  our future financial performance may be adversely affected 
in september  we completed a series of transactions that removed from our operations some internet and telephone banking products and services that we purchased during netzee  of which we own approximately of its outstanding common stock  now conducts these operations 
our historical financial results for therefore include results of operations that we no longer have 
although we no longer include netzee s operations in our financial results on a combined basis  we record a relative percentage of the operating income and losses of netzee in a single line item on our statement of operations  equity in loss of affiliate 
netzee has a history of losses and may never become profitable 
the impact of netzee s results of operations on our financial condition  including our shareholders equity  is uncertain  and we cannot be sure that we will benefit from our ownership in netzee 
if netzee does not become profitable  it may not be able to repay the loans we have made and may make to it in the future 
we provide to netzee  jointly with john h 
harland company  an million revolving line of credit secured by substantially all of netzee s assets 
of the total million available to netzee  we provide approximately million and harland provides approximately million on a pro rata basis with us provided that we are obligated to advance the last million without harland s participation 
as of march   the total amount outstanding on intercept s loans to netzee was approximately million 
we may lend additional amounts to netzee to fund its working capital needs or operations 
netzee has a history of losses and may never become profitable 
as a result  netzee may be unable to repay the loans we made to it  which would reduce the value of our investment in netzee and our shareholders equity 
our relationship with netzee presents potential conflicts of interest  which may result in decisions that favor netzee over our shareholders 
because netzee and intercept are both engaged in the sale of technology products and services to community financial institutions  numerous potential conflicts of interest exist between our companies 
we compete with each other when offering some products and services to potential customers 
our bylaws contain provisions addressing potential conflicts of interest between us and netzee and the allocation of transactions that  absent the allocation  could constitute corporate opportunities of both companies 
under these provisions  netzee may take advantage of a corporate opportunity rather than presenting that opportunity to us  absent a clear indication that the opportunity was directed to us rather than to netzee 
our existing and future agreements and relationships with netzee have not resulted and will not necessarily result from arm s length negotiations 
two of our directors serve as directors and are significant shareholders of netzee 
one of those directors  donny r 
jackson  was our president until october and is currently the chief executive officer of netzee 
john w 
collins  our chairman and chief executive officer  is the chairman of the board of directors of netzee 
when the interests of netzee diverge from our interests  netzee s officers and directors may exercise their influence in netzee s best interests 
therefore  our agreements and relationships with netzee may be less favorable to us than those that we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
moreover  many of the transactions between netzee and us do not lend themselves to precise allocations of costs and benefits 
thus  the value of these transactions will be left to the discretion of the parties  who are subject to potentially conflicting interests 
other than the provisions of our bylaws relating to corporate opportunities  the only mechanism in place to resolve these conflicts of interest is our policy that transactions with affiliated parties be approved by a majority of our disinterested directors 
nevertheless  due to the extensive relationships between netzee and us  we may make decisions that potentially favor netzee or its affiliates at the expense of our shareholders 
furthermore  georgia law may prohibit you from successfully challenging these decisions if the decision receives the affirmative vote of a majority  but not less than two  of our disinterested directors who received full disclosure of the existence and nature of the conflict 
the inability of netzee to continue as a going concern  or its receipt of an audit report from its independent auditors that is qualified to that effect  or to continue trading on the nasdaq national market could materially affect the price of our common stock 
because of our significant ownership interest in netzee  netzee s low stock price and concerns about its financial viability may affect our stock price 
nasdaq has notified netzee that it is out of compliance with nasdaq s million minimum market value requirements 
if netzee fails to comply with this requirement  it will be subject to delisting 
the value of our minority interest in netzee is based in part on the fair market value of netzee s common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market 
as of december   the carrying value of our investment in netzee was million  which was less than the market value of million as of that date 
as of march   the market value of our investment in netzee is approximately  if netzee becomes unable to continue as a going concern  we will have to write down the carrying values of our investment in and our outstanding advances to netzee 
if we take these actions  our stock price may be adversely affected 
we could face liabilities due to our large stock ownership of netzee and the number of our directors who also serve as directors of netzee 
because we own approximately of netzee s outstanding common stock and two of netzee s six directors are also directors of intercept  we could be subject to various liabilities related to netzee s business and operations 
for example  if netzee were sued in a lawsuit  we could be named a co defendant as a result of our ownership interest in and director relationships with netzee 
although we do not believe that would be proper cause for us to be liable  any lawsuit in which we are a named defendant could result in large litigation expenses and distract us from running our business while we defend our position 
risks related to our industry because many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  we may be unable to gain market share 
because our business includes a variety of products and services  we generally face different competitors within each area of our business 
in our core banking and data processing business  we compete with numerous companies that have national operations and significant assets 
our principal eft competitors include regional atm networks  regional and local banks that perform processing functions  non bank processors and other independent technology and data communications organizations 
in each of these areas  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do 
if we compete with them for the same geographic market  their financial strength could prevent us from capturing market share in those areas 
in addition  the competitive pricing pressures that would result from an increase in competition from these companies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our competitors have established cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
if we fail to adapt to emerging market demands or to compete successfully with existing and new competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if current legal actions against visa and mastercard result in a reduction of the interchange fees those companies may charge  our revenues may decrease 
we generate a significant amount of revenue from interchange fees  which are the interbank fees paid by merchants when they accept credit and debit cards 
the interchange fees are set by visa and mastercard 
visa and mastercard have been sued by the department of justice  or doj  for alleged violation of the federal antitrust laws arising out of their respective functionally identical policies of a allowing members in the respective organization to issue cards participating in the other organization s system  and b prohibiting their members from issuing cards in competing systems other than visa  mastercard or citigroup  the largest owner member of visa and mastercard 
the potential impact of this litigation on us depends upon whether or not the doj is successful  and if it is successful  the relief ordered by the court 
visa and mastercard also have been sued in a class action case brought by merchants who allege that visa and mastercard s tying rules which require merchants who accept visa and mastercard credit cards to accept all cards associated with their logos  including debit cards violate antitrust laws 
the merchants contend that the visa and mastercard interchange fees for debit cards are too high and that they should be able to choose whether to accept those debit cards 
if this class action lawsuit is successful and the interchange fees that visa and mastercard charge merchants are reduced  the revenues that we derive from interchange fees could be materially reduced 
community financial institutions are subject to industry consolidation  and we may lose customers with little notice 
we market our products and services primarily to community financial institutions 
many large financial institutions perform their own transaction processing and data communications management and therefore do not use third party providers like us 
the banking industry is prone to consolidations that result from mergers and acquisitions 
our existing customers may be acquired by or merged with other financial institutions 
any purchase or merger may result in a lost customer for us because the acquiring financial institution may not use our products and services 
although we have included in most of our contracts a charge for early termination of the contract without cause  these charges would be insufficient to replace the recurring revenues that we would have received if the financial institution had continued as a customer 
the banking industry is highly regulated  and changes in banking regulations could negatively affect our business 
our banking customers are subject to the supervision of several state and federal government regulatory agencies 
if bank regulations change  or if new regulations are adopted to regulate the products and services offered or used by community financial institutions  we could suffer an increase in the costs of providing our products and services 
moreover  if any new or revised regulations diminish the need for our services  we could lose customers and suffer a decline in revenues 
we are subject to government and private regulation  and an increase in regulatory requirements or tax burdens could place a strain on our business 
various federal and state regulatory agencies examine our data processing operations from time to time 
these agencies can make findings or recommendations regarding various aspects of our operations  and we generally must follow those recommendations to continue our data processing operations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  our operations and processing revenues could be negatively affected 
our atm network operations are subject to federal regulations governing consumers rights 
fees charged by atm owners are currently regulated in several states  and legislation regulating atm fees has been proposed in several other states 
additional legislation may be proposed and enacted in the future  or existing consumer protection laws may be expanded to apply to atm fees 
if the number of atms decreases as a result of such legislation  then our eft revenues may decline 
furthermore  we are subject to the regulations and policies of various atm and debit card associations and networks 
if we lost our privileges to provide transaction processing services across these networks  our revenues from atm and debit card transaction processing would decrease significantly 
as a transaction processing company  we may be subject to state taxation of certain portions of the fees charged for our services 
application of this tax is an emerging issue in the industry  and the states have not yet adopted uniform guidelines implementing these regulations 
if we are required to bear all or a portion of these costs and are unable to pass these costs through to our customers  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
risks related to our pending acquisitions of ibill and epx our revenues from the sale of services to merchants who use visa and mastercard are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship  and loss or suspension of this certification and sponsorship could adversely affect our business 
to provide our transaction processing services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a member service provider of  mastercard and be designated as an independent sales organization of visa 
this designation depends on our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with these standards  our designation as a certified processor  a member service provider or an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated 
the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor  or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration  or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations  would result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard issuing customers  and lead to a severe reduction in our revenues 
if our charge back rate becomes excessive  credit card associations can fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards for payment 
in cases of fraud or disputes between cardholders and merchants  we face charge backs when cardholders dispute items for which they have been billed 
charge backs may arise from the unauthorized use of the cardholder s name or bank account information or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform 
if a billing dispute between a credit card holder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant  and the purchase price is refunded to the cardholder 
if our charge back rate becomes excessive  credit card associations can fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards for payment 
if we are prohibited from accepting credit cards for payment  our ability to compete could be impaired and our business would suffer 
in the third quarter of  visa determined that ibill violated its operating rules by having excessive charge backs which resulted in fines 
we may incur excessive charge backs in the future that could result in additional fines or the termination of our ability to accept credit cards for payment  either of which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in card association fees  products or practices could increase our costs or otherwise limit our operations 
from time to time  visa  mastercard  discover  american express and diners club increase the organization and or processing fees known as interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using their card 
for example  in april visa and mastercard increased their fees by up to 
competitive pressures might force us to absorb a portion of those increases in the future  which would increase our operating costs and reduce our margins 
furthermore  the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements 
any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital 
online payment processing systems might be used for illegal or improper purposes  which could expose us to additional liability and harm our business 
despite our efforts to review and monitor the types of transactions we process  all online payment processing systems remain susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gaming  fraudulent sales of goods and services  software and other intellectual property piracy  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
our business could suffer if customers use our system for illegal or improper purposes 
our product features may infringe claims of third party patents  which could affect our business and profitability 
we could be sued for patent infringement 
if we are unable to defend ourselves successfully against these lawsuits  we could be required to restructure our payment system  stop offering our payment product altogether  or pay substantial damages 
if all or any portion of our service were found to infringe a patent and we are unable to obtain a license  or if a preliminary injunction were issued  we could be required to restructure our payment system  stop offering our payment product altogether  or pay substantial damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be sued at any time in the future by persons claiming patent infringement 
ibill is presently defending a patent infringement lawsuit 
if all or any portion of our services were found to infringe this patent  we could be required to restructure our payment system  stop offering our payment product altogether or pay substantial damages 
even if we prevail in a lawsuit  litigation can be expensive and can consume substantial amounts of management time and attention 
because some of the transactions ibill processes are for the adult entertainment industry  our reputation with our customers and in the investment community may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
ibill processes transactions for merchants in many different industries  including the adult entertainment industry 
certain current and potential customers as well as investors  lenders  and others may be reluctant or refuse to do business with us  participate in the market for our common stock  provide financing  or offer related services because we process transactions for the adult entertainment industry 
this may negatively affect our business  financial results  the price of our common stock or limit our ability to raise capital in the future 
our customers may not adopt our online payment methods as soon as we intend  which would limit our growth and may cause our stock price to decline 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to implement our strategy to increase adoption of our online payment methods 
we cannot assure you that the relatively new market for online payment mechanisms will remain viable 
we expect to invest substantial amounts to o drive merchant awareness of electronic payments  o encourage merchants to sign up for and use our electronic payment products  o enhance our infrastructure to handle seamless processing of transactions  o continue to develop our technology  and o diversify our customer base 
we may fail to increase the adoption of our electronic payment methods as we intend  which would adversely impact revenues and cause our business to suffer 
we face strong competition in the merchant processing and online processing businesses 
in our online processing business we will compete with other online processing companies like global payment technologies  inc and paypal  inc 
in our merchant processing business  we will compete with large merchant processors like chase merchant systems  national processing  paymentech  us bancorp  first data  concord efs and others 
in each of these areas  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing or new competitors 
other risks of owning our stock a few people control a large portion of our stock and may vote their shares in ways contrary to your interests 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  our executive officers and directors can exercise control over our company and have the power to influence the election of a majority of the directors  the appointment of management and the approval of actions requiring a majority vote of our shareholders 
their interests may conflict with your interest as a shareholder  and they could use their power to delay or prevent a change in control  even if a majority of the shareholders desired a change 
future sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
to carry out our growth strategies  we plan to acquire other businesses and products using a combination of our stock and cash  and we may also sell additional shares of our stock to raise money for expanding our operations 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market or the prospect of such sales could adversely affect the market for our common stock 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and options outstanding to acquire an additional  shares of common stock 
if slm earns any portion or all of the  shares of our common stock potentially issuable to it under our purchase agreement with slm  your ownership interest in our company would be diluted 
additionally  we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan which became effective on july   and any issuance pursuant to this plan would also dilute your ownership interest in our company 
the failure to sustain our current growth rates or to achieve expected growth rates could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant growth since our inception 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in this revenue growth is attributed to both the internal growth of our business  as well as revenue growth achieved through acquisitions we have completed 
either our internal growth rate or our total growth rate  or both  may decline significantly in the future due to factors within or beyond our control 
our failure to sustain current growth rates  or achieve growth rates expected by stock market analysts  could have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
georgia law  our articles of incorporation and bylaws and some of our employment agreements contain provisions that could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire your shares at a premium to the market price 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and georgia law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
some of our executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us that contain change in control provisions 
these provisions may discourage or prevent a tender offer  proxy contest or other attempted takeover 
in addition  we have in the past and may in the future create and issue new classes of preferred stock that have greater rights than our common stock 
these superior rights may include greater voting rights  entitlement to dividends and preferential treatment in the event of a change in control  liquidation  consolidation or other circumstances 
any shares of preferred stock that we issue may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire our shares of common stock at a premium price 
we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may impact our business and  therefore  the risks and uncertainties discussed above may not be the only ones you should consider 
the risks and uncertainties discussed above are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally 
in addition  as we continue to grow our business  we may encounter other risks of which we are not aware at this time 
these additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future  the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investments and do not have significant operations subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
borrowings under the first union credit facility accrue interest at a fluctuating rate based either upon the lender s prime rate or libor 
as of march   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 
any future borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates that increase the interest rate on the credit facility would make it more costly to borrow under that facility and may impede our acquisition and growth strategies if we determine that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
additional loans to netzee may increase the amount outstanding under this facility 
we have loaned slm million and we have a million line of credit to netzee 
as of march   million was outstanding on the netzee line of credit 
changes in interest rates that decrease the interest rates on these loans will decrease our interest income
