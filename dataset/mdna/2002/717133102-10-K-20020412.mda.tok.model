item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of forward looking statements  which are subject to the safe harbor created by these sections 
forward looking statements are statements about future financial results  future products or services and other events that have not yet occurred 
these forward looking statements contain words such as  but not limited to  expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  will  may or might 
investors should be aware that actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future 
we will not necessarily update the information in this form k if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate 
details about risks affecting various aspects of our business are discussed throughout this form k and include the risks identified in factors affecting operating results 
recent events during  we relocated our corporate headquarters  distribution center and laboratory operations from the silicon valley area of northern california to a new facility in haltom city  texas 
we vacated our primary menlo park  california facility in may and temporarily moved to our existing facility in fort worth  texas until construction was completed at the new haltom city facility 
during the process of relocating to texas  we have incurred significant costs that have been financed through a combination of internal operations  increased borrowing under our existing and new credit facilities and a sale leaseback transaction 
we believe these costs were of a nonrecurring nature and principally relate to the period prior to occupying our new haltom city facility 
our laboratory operations and distribution center relocated to the haltom city facility in september and october  respectively 
to mitigate further operating losses  we implemented a cost containment program in the fourth quarter of this cost containment program included two rounds of layoffs whereby our employee population has decreased approximately from mid levels  significant reductions in discretionary spending  including travel  renegotiations with certain suppliers to secure more favorable pricing of materials and services and closure of our satellite laboratory in menlo park that performed methadone drug testing 
we were not in compliance with certain covenants under our credit facility with our primary bank for the last three quarterly periods of due principally to the restructuring charge and nonrecurring expenses associated with the relocation to texas  the slowdown of the us economy throughout and the september   event that adversely affected the volume of pre employment drug testing 
in july  our bank waived the covenant violations for the quarter ended june  as further discussed in note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  in march we completed the sale of entire share capital of medscreen for approximately  in cash 
in connection with the sale of medscreen  we entered into an amendment and forbearance agreement with our bank and the bank waived covenant violations for the quarterly periods ended september  and december  a portion of the sale proceeds were used to repay  of debt and the remainder is expected to be sufficient to fund the general corporate needs of the us operations for at least the next year 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon pharmchem s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring accruals  contingencies  revenue recognition  specimen collector accruals and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
pharmchem believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we estimate the quantity and value of our unused specimen collection kit inventory existing at our customer and contractor field locations using a model that considers actual shipments to these locations  specimens returned to our laboratory for processing  replacement costs and estimates of shrinkage 
if the estimated value of this inventory increases beyond our expectations of recovery  additional inventory write downs may be required 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of our operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the related goodwill  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while pharmchem has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
revenue is recognized upon the communication of results from laboratory analysis of specimens submitted by our customers  at the time of shipment for products and at the completion of rendered services 
we accrue expected payments to specimen collectors who perform specimen collection services on behalf of our managed customers 
the specimen collector accrual calculation is based on a combination of our reporting of results from laboratory analysis of specimens and cost information maintained in our internal systems for each specimen collector 
we include in the accrual estimates of retroactive rate increases and services performed but not reported to customers

these nonrecurring costs include duplicate payroll  lab materials  training and transportation 
our relocation to texas was predicated on our belief that the cost structure was severely challenged in the silicon valley area of northern california due to the region s higher wages  rents  insurance programs and overall high cost of living and the uncertainty of electric power

during  we completed two capital lease financing transactions totaling  and a significant portion of the proceeds were used for repayment of existing debt 
we had net borrowings of the revolving line of credit totaling  and repayments on term debt and capital leases totaled  we also used  to acquire property and equipment  mostly related to computer software  laboratory analyzers and leasehold improvements in the new texas facility 
during  we had net repayments on the revolving line of credit of  and we acquired  of property and equipment 
we have a loan and security agreement credit agreement with our bank 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings under the revolving line of credit limited to of qualified accounts receivables and is secured by a lien on a significant portion of our assets 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  which  among others  require pharmchem to maintain certain ratios of working capital and net worth 
the credit agreement permits up to  of the revolving line of credit to be used to repurchase our common stock under our common stock repurchase program and permits the declaration and distribution of a dividend in connection with our stockholder rights 
table of contents plan 
the credit agreement expires in may and our intent is to renew the credit agreement with our primary bank or to seek a similar agreement from another financial institution 
the credit agreement was amended at various times during to provide for  of construction financing fully repaid in  change the revolving maturity date to may   provide for  of short term borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit fully repaid in  reduce the interest rate to the bank s prime rate  reduce the maximum line of credit to  reduce the commitment fee to of the maximum line of credit  modify our existing covenants and provide for the issuance of subordinated debt

during  our total debt increased from  on december  to  on december   as follows amounts in thousands december  march  june  september  december  revolver and current debt long term debt as more fully discussed in note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  approximately  of debt was repaid with the proceeds from the march sale of medscreen 
in the past few years  we have initially financed our capital expenditures using our revolving line of credit 
upon certain project milestones being achieved under the capital project  certain expenditures would be refinanced by entering into capital leases 
we completed two such capital lease refinancings in january and august the increase in the second quarter reflects advances on our revolving line of credit as we commenced the relocation of the company to texas from california 
the increase in the third quarter principally reflects the issuance of subordinated debt in september and the increase in the fourth quarter reflects medscreen s two new loan facilities completed in october on october   medscreen completed two term loan facilities with its bank in the aggregate amount of  pound sterling 
the first loan facility is for  pound sterling and carries an interest rate at the bank s lending rate plus at december  
the second loan facility is in us dollars up to a principal sum of  pound sterling and carries an interest rate at the bank s federal lending rate plus at december  
these facilities are for a term of months  are secured by a debenture deed on medscreen s assets and contain a financial covenant requiring a minimum net worth of  pound sterling 
refer to note  subsequent events  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these loan facilities being fully repaid in march on september and september   we closed transactions with three stockholders resulting in the issuance of unsecured subordinated promissory notes notes  in an aggregate amount of  in addition  the stockholders received without additional consideration warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
interest on the notes accrues at a rate of per annum and is payable annually during the term of the notes 
the notes will mature on september  our obligation under the notes is subordinate in payment and priority to the indebtedness of the company due and owing to our bank 
the warrants are immediately exercisable by each stockholder for shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share and expire five years from the date of the closing 
the warrants also provide each stockholder certain registration rights for the warrant shares 
on the closing dates  the fair value of each warrant was based on the black scholes option pricing model and using assumptions of a risk free rate of return  year life and a annual volatility of our stock price 
the fair value of the warrants is classified as a discount to the notes and is being amortized to expense over a two year period 
as of december   the unamortized discount was  
table of contents on january   we completed a  financing lease agreement with a group of lessors to refinance certain modules of atlas  our new laboratory information management system 
the lease agreement bears interest at and is payable over to months 
on august   we completed a  financing lease agreement with a lessor to refinance laboratory equipment  other equipment and additional modules of atlas 
the lease agreement bears interest at and is payable over to months 
the proceeds from both leases were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and to fund additional capital expenditures 
these leases have been accounted for as financings 
on september   we entered into a  installment note with our bank  with terms and conditions similar to the credit agreement 
the majority of the proceeds from the installment note were immediately used to pay off the amount outstanding under a separate  installment note with the same bank 
the installment note is subject to the terms and conditions of the amended credit agreement  currently bears interest at the prime rate plus and is payable over months 
as discussed in note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we entered into an amendment and forbearance agreement with our bank and the installment note was fully repaid with proceeds from the sale of medscreen 
during the process of relocating to texas  we have incurred significant costs that have been financed through a combination of internal operations  increased borrowing under our existing and new credit facilities and a sale leaseback transaction 
we believe these costs were of a nonrecurring nature and principally relate to the period prior to occupying our new haltom city  texas corporate headquarters  main laboratory and distribution center 
our laboratory operations and distribution center relocated to the haltom city facility in september and october  respectively 
due principally to the restructuring charge and nonrecurring expenses associated with the relocation to texas  we were not in compliance with certain debt covenants for the last three quarterly periods of in july  our bank waived the covenant violations for the quarter ended june  as discussed in note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we entered into an amendment and forbearance agreement with our bank in connection with the sale of medscreen and the bank waived the covenant violations for the quarterly periods ended september  and december  the amendment and forbearance agreement required us to partially repay our revolving line of credit and fully repay our term debt with the bank and  therefore  we reclassified  from long term debt to current portion of long term debt on our balance sheet as of december  due to the higher debt leverage of the company  the net losses incurred during the year  the slowdown in the us economy that adversely affected the volume of pre employment drug testing  the low common stock price and the tightening of the credit markets after the september   terrorist tragedy  we expect it to be more difficult to secure additional financing on favorable terms  if needed 
to mitigate the needs for further financing  we implemented a cost containment program in the fourth quarter of this cost containment program included two rounds of layoffs whereby our employee population has decreased approximately from mid levels  significant reductions in discretionary spending  including travel  renegotiations with certain suppliers to secure more favorable pricing of materials and services and closure of our california laboratory that offered customers methadone testing using thin layer chromatography 
in addition  as further discussed in note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we completed the sale of medscreen in march and we expect the proceeds from the sale of medscreen to be sufficient to fund the general corporate needs of the us operations for at least the next year 
in the event of continued lower specimen volume  we expect to sublet underutilized facilities  further reduce our employee population  lower guidelines for employee wage increases  limit capital expenditures and implement other actions to preserve cash 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it removes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas also supercedes the business 
table of contents segment concept in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
sfas retains the requirement of apb opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of and the implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  effective january   which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas this statement will further require intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas will require us to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
on an ongoing basis  the amortization of goodwill noted in the statements of operations will be eliminated beginning january  as of december   we had unamortized goodwill of  of which  is attributed to the us operations 
amortization expense related to goodwill was  for the year ended december  at this time  the adoption of the impairment provisions of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires liability recognition for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no later than january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting operating results we are subject to a number of risks which could affect operating results and liquidity  including  among others  the following competition and customer contracts the market for drug testing services became increasingly competitive in the s  and continues to be very competitive 
drug testing laboratories compete primarily on the basis of customer service  technical capability and price 
we compete for customer contracts against firms that may have greater financial  marketing  laboratory and related resources 
a majority of our sales arise out of competitively bid contracts  which are awarded based on technical superiority  customer service and price 
the failure to renew a significant contract  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could result in lower sales  lower profit margins  decreased cash flows and losses 
our contracts generally allow termination at the customer s discretion on short notice with little or no penalty 
many contracts provide for termination for convenience 
in addition  relatively few of our contracts call for minimum contract amounts or payments 
although in the past our customers generally have not exercised these early termination rights  there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future 
early termination of a substantial contract  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could have a material  adverse effect on pharmchem 
pharmchek drugs of abuse patch since  we have been investing in pharmchek  a system which uses sweat to detect the use of illegal drugs 
to date  our sales of pharmchek have not been material and there is no assurance that it will continue to be 
table of contents commercially accepted by existing or new customers or generate significant revenues in the future 
while the company that developed pharmchek has obtained patents relating to its technology  there are various risks associated with the technology 
there is no assurance as to the validity of such patents that the products we market will be covered by such patents that competitors will not infringe upon such patents or successfully design similar or competing products that do not infringe upon such patents that the company that obtained the pharmchek patents will continue to be able to deliver products to pharmchem or that an alternative supplier will be found customer concentration our two largest customers combined accounted for approximately of our sales in and of our sales in the loss of these contracts  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could result in lower sales  lower profit margins  decreased cash flows and losses 
we have in the past failed to renew significant contracts which has had adverse effects on pharmchem 
see competition and customer contracts above 
certification we are certified by samhsa  cap and a number of states to conduct drug testing using forensic procedures 
certification is essential to our business because some of our customers are required to use certified laboratories  and many of our customers look to certification as an indication of accuracy and reliability of results 
in order to remain certified  we are subject to frequent inspections and proficiency tests 
failure to meet any of the numerous certification requirements to which we are subject could result in suspension or loss of certification 
such suspension or loss of certification could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
in connection with the consolidation of our laboratory operations into our new haltom city  texas laboratory  in november we voluntarily withdrew our fort worth  texas laboratory s license to conduct laboratory testing of federally regulated specimens 
federally regulated specimens represented less than of our specimen volume in we are currently in the process of applying for certification of our new laboratory and we believe that a license will be granted in the second quarter of until the new laboratory is certified  we have temporarily outsourced our customers federally regulated specimens to another certified laboratory 
in the event the certification process is delayed  our plan will be to continue to outsource such specimens until the certification is achieved 
seasonal trends and economic conditions seasonal trends to which drug testing laboratories are generally subject affect our operations 
in the past  testing volume tends to be higher in the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters  primarily due to the hiring patterns of our public and private employer customer group which affect pre employment drug testing 
demand for our services is also dependent on general economic conditions 
recessionary periods generally result in fewer new hires  and therefore may lead to fewer pre employment drug tests for public and private employer customers 
similarly  customers may scale back their drug testing program in a tight labor market to enhance their chances of hiring candidates by expediting the hiring decision making or by rehiring workers that were subject to a prior layoff and not require the workers to be further drug tested 
budget cuts at the federal  state or local level could reduce business from our public employer  criminal justice agency and government funded drug treatment program customers 
an extended recessionary period could have a material  adverse impact on our liquidity if we are unable to reduce our cost structure on a proportionate basis or seek further financing on favorable terms 
during high seasonal periods  we have traditionally used temporary personnel to assist our permanent work force with the higher operational requirements of increased specimen volumes 
because expenses associated with maintaining our testing work force are relatively fixed over the short term  our profit margins tend to increase in periods of higher testing volume and decrease in periods of lower testing volume 

table of contents judicial decisions and government policy state and federal courts have generally permitted the use of drug testing under certain circumstances and using certain procedures 
however  challenges to drug testing programs are raised from time to time by employees  unions and other groups in litigation on constitutional  privacy and other grounds 
in addition  legal precedent in a number of states governs the circumstances under which employers may test employees and the procedures under which such tests must be conducted 
societal changes toward greater acceptance of certain drugs  such as for medical purposes  may result in a relaxation of drug enforcement laws and policies that would decrease demand for drug testing programs 
although we believe that  to date  no such litigation or law has had a material adverse impact upon our business  new decisions  legislation or policies which restrict the use of drug testing could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
credit availability we maintain a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
all borrowings are secured by a lien on a significant portion of our assets 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  of which we were in violation for most of due to the adverse effects on our company of the weakened us economy and the significant costs incurred to relocate our company s operations from california to texas 
continued operating losses will generally make it increasingly more difficult for the company to renew credit facilities on favorable terms and to secure additional or replacement credit facilities 
due to the costs associated with relocating and the investments to complete our new facility in haltom city  texas  we have operated at or near the maximum availability of our revolving line of credit since the middle of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business  we are sued by individuals  primarily those in the criminal justice system  who have tested positive for drugs of abuse 
in addition  we frequently testify in administrative and court proceedings involving the results of our tests 
to date  we have not experienced any material liability related to these claims  although there can be no assurance that we will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims 
environmental matters prior to the closure of our california laboratories in  a small portion of our california business involved testing procedures requiring the use of radioactive reagents  which are considered to be hazardous materials 
failure to comply with current or future federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations regarding these hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
we believe we were in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations during the periods we operated the california laboratories 
we no longer use such radioactive reagents 
dependence on key personnel our success is dependent in part on our key management and technical personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
all of our key executive officers relocated with the company to texas in none of our key employees has an employment contract with us 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk with respect to our debt outstanding and foreign currency transactions 
our revolving line of credit and bank installment note carry interest at the prime rate plus 
as the prime rate increases  we will incur higher relative interest expense and a decrease in the prime rate will reduce relative interest expense 
in recent years  there have not been significant fluctuations in the prime rate 
assuming levels of debt consistent with historical amounts  a change in the prime rate would not materially change interest expense 

table of contents due to our international operations  certain transactions are conducted in foreign currencies 
medscreen s transactions are denominated approximately in pound sterling and in us currency 
medscreen s net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively  and  as a result  we do not consider the impact of market risk on foreign currency transactions material 
for that reason  we do not intend to engage in hedging transactions 
refer to note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the recently completed sale of medscreen in march
