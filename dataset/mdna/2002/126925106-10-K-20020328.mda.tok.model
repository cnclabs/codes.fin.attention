in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company cautions investors that any forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
several factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are discussed below 
these factors are not intended to be an all encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business 
in providing forward looking statements  the company is not undertaking any obligation to update publicly or otherwise these statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

rapid technological change and voice data convergence cabletel expects that data communications traffic will grow substantially in the future compared to the modest growth expected for voice traffic 
the growth of data traffic is expected to have a significant impact on traditional voice networks and create market discontinuities that should drive the convergence of data and telephony 
many of the company s traditional customers have already been investing in data networking and that trend is expected to continue 
due to the evolving nature of the communications industry and the technologies involved  there can be no assurance as to the rate of such convergence 
rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and relatively short product life cycles characterize the markets for cabletel s products 
the company s success is expected to depend  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments achieved by its competitors 
the success of new or enhanced products is dependent on a number of factors including the timely introduction of such products  market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards  and the pricing and marketing of such products 
an unanticipated change in one or more of the technologies affecting telecommunications and data networking  or in market demand for products based on specific technology could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company if it fails to respond in a timely and effective manner to such changes 
competition all aspects of cabletel s business are highly competitive 
cabletel competes for sales with national  regional and local distributors  wholesalers and manufacturers of products for the cable television industry 
various manufacturers that supply cabletel also sell their products to canadian cable television operators directly or through commissioned agents 
in addition  because of the convergence of the cable telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the canadian cable television distribution market 
many of cabletel s competitors or potential competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  and loss of market share  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
cabletel s commodity products compete on the basis of price and delivery time 
cabletel s higher technology products  such as transmitters and receivers  compete on the basis of product and specifications and functionality  as well as price 
international growth  foreign exchange  and interest rates cabletel intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets 
in many international markets  long standing relationships  including local content requirements and type approvals  create barriers to entry 
in addition  pursuit of such international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on such investments  if any  are realized 
such projects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in opening of foreign markets to new competitors  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  investment policies  repatriation of cash  naturalization  social and political risks  taxation and other factors  depending on the country in which such opportunities arise 
difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies  and of foreign financial institutions  could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries 
in order to grow internationally  it is expected that the company will be required to provide significant amounts of customer financing in connection with the sale of products and services 
capital spending of key customers changes in spending patterns of cabletel s key customers will have a direct effect on the results of the company s operations and financial condition 
in particular  sales to rogers cable systems limited  east link cablesystems  cogeco cable inc  shaw communications inc  and regional cablesystems cabletel s largest customers which have accounted for approximately    and respectively for the month period ending december   of the company s total sales 
any future decision by rogers cablesystems limited or east link cablesystems  to reduce purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
general industry and market conditions and growth rates cabletel s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that must be managed in order to achieve desired operating results 
in addition  there are trends and factors beyond the company s control  which affect its operations 
such trends and factors include general domestic or global economic conditions as well as competitive  technological  and regulatory developments and trends specific to the company s industry  customers and markets 
these conditions and events could be substantially different than believed or expected and these differences may cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements made or the results which could be expected to accompany such statements 
cabletel competes in a highly volatile and rapidly growing industry that is characterized by vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development carried out amidst uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of intellectual property rights 
these factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition both from start up companies and from well capitalized communication companies 
consolidations in the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry has experienced the consolidation of many industry participants and this trend is expected to continue 
cabletel and one or more of its competitors may each supply products to the corporations that have merged or will merge 
this consolidation could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the merged corporations with the company playing a greater or lesser role in supplying the communications products to the merged entity 
these purchasing decisions of the merged companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
mergers among the supplier base have recently increased and this trend is also expected to continue 
the larger combined companies with pooled capital resources may be able to provide solution alternatives with which the company would be put at a disadvantage to compete 
the larger breadth of product offerings these consolidated suppliers could provide could result in customers electing to trim their supplier base for the advantages of one stop shopping solutions for all their product needs 
these consolidated supplier companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial conditions 
current and future strategic alliances and acquisitions will play a strong role in the company s ability to compete within this changing landscape 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk the following discussion of the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cabletel is exposed to various market risks  including interest rates and foreign currency rates 
changes in these rates may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  cabletel may enter into various derivative transactions  when appropriate 
cabletel does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
as of december   the company had no material contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of sales of its products in various foreign countries and manufacturing operations conducted in israel 
in order to minimize the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  most sales contracts are issued in either canadian or us dollars 
the company constantly monitors the exchange rate between the us dollar  the canadian dollar and the new israel shekel to determine if any adverse exposure exists relative to its costs of manufacturing 
the company does not maintain new israel shekel denominated currency 
instead  us dollars are exchanged for shekels at the time of payments
