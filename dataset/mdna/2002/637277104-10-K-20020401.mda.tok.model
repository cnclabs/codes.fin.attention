item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this analysis of the company s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment were present  the company would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and intangibles  including goodwill  in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business  which are based on judgment and assumptions 
warranty 
the company s warranty reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on recent actual warranty claims 
also  the company s recall reserve is established  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the cost per unit to remedy the problem and the estimated number of units that will ultimately be brought in for the repair 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty costs that it has in the past 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
revenue recognition 
beginning with the year  motorhome and towables sales are recorded by the company when accepted by the dealer rather than at the time of shipment as in prior years 
this change in accounting principle was made to implement sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
legal proceedings 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and has accrued its estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
in addition to routine litigation and claims incidental to the company s business  on august   four former sales representatives of nrv sued nrv in riverside county  california superior court asserting age discrimination and related claims arising out of their employment with nrv 
the four plaintiffs seek unspecified amounts for wages from the date of separation to an unspecified future date  punitive damages and attorney s fees 
on november   the company filed an answer denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses thereto 
the company intends to continue to defend this matter vigorously 
an ultimate adverse decision against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition

the net loss was mainly attributable to i restraints on paint capacity which limited the sales of national rv brand diesel motorhomes  ii significant discounting to wholesale distributors  iii increased warranty costs and iv excess manufacturing capacity and related fixed costs caused by decreased volumes 
the company has a revolving credit facility of  with bank of america  na bofa  of which  is reserved for a letter of credit  required by the state of california  serving as security for nrv s self insured workers compensation program 
the remaining  is available for general corporate and working capital needs and capital expenditures 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus percentage points 
the credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain financial covenants  including net worth and profitability 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility  however  the company was in default with certain covenants of its loan agreement with bofa 
the company obtained a waiver of default from bofa as of december  which cures all defaults as of such date 
however  the company expects that it will not be in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the credit facility as of the next measurement date  march  as a result  bofa may thereafter restrict the company from borrowing any funds available under the facility  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to utilize the facility any longer 
the company is currently investigating other banks to replace this revolving credit facility which expires on august  losses in the third quarter of caused the above referenced revolving credit facility to be reduced from  the combination of restricted credit availability  increases in certain categories of inventory and additional losses in the fourth quarter of led to significant cash reductions in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the company has addressed the liquidity issue by stretching accounts payable  aggressively pursuing accounts receivable and reducing inventories

effects of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach  will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the full impact that adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 
however  the company does anticipate that operating expenses will be reduced by approximately  per year due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as required by the standard 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset obligations 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and that the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not determined the impact that adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion  reporting extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and amends apb opinion  consolidated financial statements 
this statement was issued to address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb opinion and to establish a single accounting model based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the impact that adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
actual performance and results may differ materially from that projected or suggested herein due to certain risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  factors set forth below 
additional information concerning risks and uncertainties may be identified from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and the company s public announcements  copies of which are available from the sec or from the company upon request 
factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the level of discounting employed on the company s products  the ability to utilize and expand manufacturing resources efficiently  material shortages  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole  such as cyclicality and seasonality 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin on its products may decline in future periods to the extent the company increases its sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches sold shifts to lower gross margin units 
due to the relatively high selling prices of the company s products in particular  its highline class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
cyclicality and seasonality 
the rv industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic conditions  which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
concerns about the availability and price of gasoline  decreases in consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and reductions in available financing have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on rv sales 
seasonal factors  over which the company has no control  also have an effect on the demand for the company s products 
demand in the rv industry declines over the winter season  while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
dependence on certain dealers and concentration of dealers in certain regions 
for the year ended december   two dealers accounted for and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
also  the company s top ten dealers accounted for approximately  and of the company s annual net sales during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss by the company of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s sales is from dealers located in states in the western part of the united states 
consequently  a general downturn in economic conditions or other material events in such region could materially adversely affect the company s sales 
dependence on chassis suppliers 
one of the principal components used in the manufacture of motorhomes is the chassis  which includes the engine  drive train and other operating components 
although country coach manufactures chassis used in its products  the company obtains the required chassis for most of its nrv class a motorhomes from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is standard in the industry  arrangements with such suppliers permit them to terminate their relationship with the company at any time 
lead times for the delivery of chassis frequently exceed five weeks and the rv industry as a whole has from time to time experienced temporary shortages of chassis 
if any of the company s suppliers were to discontinue the manufacture of chassis utilized by the company in the manufacture of its class a motorhomes  materially reduce their availability to the rv industry in general or limit or terminate their availability to the company in particular  the business and financial condition of the company could be materially and adversely affected 
potential liabilities under repurchase agreements 
as is common in the industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
these agreements obligate the company to purchase a dealer s inventory under certain circumstances in the event of a default by the dealer to its lender 
the risk of loss  however  is spread over many dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the rvs that the company would be required to repurchase 
although losses under these agreements have not been significant in the past  if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of rvs in the future  it could result in losses and a reduction in new rv sales 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of december  competition 
the company competes with numerous manufacturers  many of which have multiple product lines of rvs  are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
according to statistical surveys  inc  the two largest motorhome manufacturers had sales aggregating of industry wide retail unit sales of class a motorhomes for the year ended december  in addition  sales of used rvs provide competition to rv manufacturers 
government regulation 
the company is subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of their products  including the provisions of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act the motor vehicle act and the safety standards for rvs and components that have been promulgated thereunder by the department of transportation 
the motor vehicle act authorizes the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain certain hazards or defects 
the company has from time to time instituted voluntary recalls of certain motorhome units 
future recalls of the company s vehicles  voluntary or involuntary  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale  transportation and marketing of motor vehicles  including so called lemon laws 
federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight  length and width of motor vehicles  including trucks and motorhomes  that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
as a result of these restrictions  certain models of motorhomes manufactured by the company s country coach subsidiary may not be legally operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions 
enforcement of these laws and related customer complaints to date has been limited 
the company is unable to predict reliably the extent of future enforcement of these laws  the extent future enforcement might lead to customer complaints  or the extent to which country coach may choose or be required to provide some customer remedy  such as repurchasing or exchanging motorhomes  as a result of such complaints 
if current enforcement efforts and related complaints were to increase significantly from their current levels  the cost of resolving such complaints  particularly should the resolution of complaints require repurchasing  refurbishing  and reselling of motorhomes  could have a material financial effect on the company 
amendments and changes in enforcement with respect to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new laws and regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing  purchasing  operating or selling the company s products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure of the company to comply with these present or future laws or regulations could result in fines imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  or suspension of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to the use  generation  storage  treatment  emissions  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and noise pollution 
such laws and regulations are becoming more stringent  and it is likely that future amendments to these environmental statutes and additional regulations promulgated thereunder will be applicable to the company  its manufacturing operations and its products in the future 
the failure of the company to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  suspension of operations  alterations to the manufacturing process or costly cleanup or capital expenditures 
warranty claims 
the company is subject to warranty claims in the ordinary course of its business 
although the company maintains reserves for such claims  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding the company s current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
product liability 
the company maintains product liability insurance with coverage in amounts which management believes is reasonable 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
given the nature of the company s business  product liability in excess of the company s insurance coverage  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the california energy crisis 
nrv s manufacturing facilities are located in southern california 
california has been experiencing an energy crisis that has resulted in disruptions in power supply and increases in utility costs to consumers and businesses throughout the state 
should the energy crisis continue  nrv may experience power interruptions and shortages and be subject to costs and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with temporarily shutting down production 
although nrv has not experienced any material disruption to its business to date  if the energy crisis continues and power interruptions or shortages occur in the future  they may adversely affect the company s business 
antitakeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  as well as delaware corporate law and the company s stockholder rights plan the rights plan  may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest 
such provisions also may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
certain of such provisions allow the company s board of directors to issue  without additional stockholder approval  preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed matter 
in august  the company adopted the rights plan  pursuant to which holders of the common stock received a distribution of rights to purchase additional shares of common stock  which rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events
