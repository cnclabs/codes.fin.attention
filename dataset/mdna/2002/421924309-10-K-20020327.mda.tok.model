item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  including various factors related to acquisitions and divestitures we have made during the periods indicated  the timing and nature of which have significantly affected our consolidated results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on june   we acquired from mariner post acute network  inc mariner substantially all of the assets of mariner s american rehability services division  which operated approximately outpatient rehabilitation centers in states the rehability acquisition 
the net cash purchase price was approximately  the rehability acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquired operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the rehability acquisition was our only material acquisition in the three years ended december  during the second quarter of  we sold substantially all of our occupational medicine operations to us healthworks  inc and our richmond  virginia medical center to hca the healthcare company 
these transactions yielded net cash proceeds of approximately  and a net loss on the sale of assets of  during the fourth quarter of  we sold our diagnostic operations in the united kingdom to lodestone patient care  limited and four non strategic rehabilitation hospitals to meadowbrook healthcare corporation 
these transactions yielded net cash proceeds of approximately  and a net loss on sale of assets of  we also completed a sale leaseback transaction for thirteen of our facilities which yielded net cash proceeds of  and a net loss on the sale of assets of  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  requires an enterprise to report operating segments based upon the way its operations are managed 
this approach defines operating segments along the lines used by management to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions 
based on our management and reporting structure  segment information has been presented for inpatient and other clinical services  outpatient services and non patient care services 
the inpatient and other clinical services segment includes the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical centers  as well as the operations of certain physician practices and other clinical services which are managerially aligned with our inpatient services 
the outpatient services segment includes the operations of our outpatient rehabilitation facilities  outpatient surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers 
the non patient care services segment includes the operations of our corporate office  general and administrative costs  non clinical subsidiaries and other operations that are independent of our inpatient and outpatient services segments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for financial data for each of our operating segments 
there are increasing pressures from many payor sources to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and third party payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels 
in addition  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicare reimbursement for certain services 
we cannot now predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect such proposals would have on us 
changes in reimbursement policies or rates by private or governmental payors could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
medicare reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation services is changing from a cost based reimbursement system to a prospective payment system pps  with the phase in of the pps having begun january  we believe we are well positioned and well prepared for the transition and that our emphasis on cost effective services means that the inpatient rehabilitation pps will have a positive effect on our results of operations 
our early experience with payments under pps has been consistent with our internal estimates 
however  because implementation of pps has only recently begun  we cannot be certain that the ultimate impact of the pps transition will be consistent with our current expectations 
in addition  the climate for both governmental and non governmental reimbursement frequently changes  and future changes in reimbursement rates could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in many cases  we operate more than one site within a market 
in such markets  there is customarily an outpatient center or inpatient facility with associated satellite outpatient locations 
for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  same store outpatient rehabilitation operations are measured on locations within markets in which similar operations existed at the end of the period and include the operations of additional outpatient rehabilitation locations opened within the same market 
new store outpatient rehabilitation operations are measured on locations within new markets 
same store operations in our other business lines are measured based on specific locations 
we may  from time to time  close or consolidate similar locations in multi site markets to obtain efficiencies and respond to changes in demand 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
those reported amounts could differ  in some cases materially  if we made different estimates and judgments with respect to particular items in our financial statements 
we make such estimates and judgments based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances in an effort to ensure that our financial statements fairly reflect our financial condition and results of operations 
we describe some of the most important policies that we follow in making such estimates and judgments below 
revenues and contractual reserves our revenues include net patient service revenues and other operating revenues 
net patient service revenues are reported at estimated net realizable amounts from patients  insurance companies  third party payors primarily medicare and medicaid and others for services rendered 
revenues from third party payors also include estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements that are subject to final review and settlement by appropriate authorities 
we estimate contractual adjustments from non governmental third party payors based on historical experience and the terms of payor contracts 
our reimbursement from governmental third party payors is based upon cost reports  medicare and medicaid payment regulations and other reimbursement mechanisms which require the application and interpretation of complex regulations and policies  and such reimbursement is subject to various levels of review and adjustment by fiscal intermediaries and others  which may affect the final determination of reimbursement 
we estimate net realizable amounts from governmental payors based on historical experience and interpretations of such regulations and policies 
in the event that final reimbursement differs from our estimates  our actual revenues and net income  and our accounts receivable  could vary from the amounts reported 
allowance for doubtful accounts as with any healthcare provider  some of our accounts receivable will ultimately prove uncollectible for various reasons  including the inability of patients or third party payors to satisfy their financial obligations to us 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility 
net accounts receivable includes only those amounts we estimate to be collectible based on this evaluation 
unforeseen factors  such as the insolvency of third party payors  could cause our estimate to be inaccurate and could cause our actual results and the amount of our accounts receivable to vary from amounts reported in our financial statements 
impairment of goodwill many of our facilities came to us through acquisitions 
we determine the amortization period of the cost in excess of net asset value of purchased facilities based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual purchase transaction 
the evaluation includes an analysis of historic and projected financial performance  an evaluation of the estimated useful life of the buildings and fixed assets acquired  the indefinite useful life of certificates of need and licenses acquired  the competition within local markets  lease terms where applicable  and the legal terms of partnerships where applicable 
we utilize independent appraisers and rely on our own management expertise in evaluating each of the factors noted above 
with respect to the carrying value of the excess of cost over net asset value of individual purchased facilities and other intangible assets  we determine on a quarterly basis whether an impairment event has occurred by considering factors such as the market value of the asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action by regulators  a history of operating losses or cash flow losses  or a projection of continuing losses associated with an operating entity 
the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  our carrying value of the asset will be reduced to the estimated fair market value 
fair value is determined based on the individual facts and circumstances of the impairment event  and the available information related to it 
such information might include quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved  and independent appraisals 
for purposes of analyzing impairment  assets are generally grouped at the individual operational facility level  which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if we acquired the group of assets being tested as part of a purchase business combination  any goodwill that arose as part of the transaction is included as part of the asset grouping 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment rather than a monthly amortization of the balance 
this testing takes place in two steps the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit  and the determination of the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we are currently evaluating the financial impact of adopting the new policy 
because we have recorded and expect in the future to record significant goodwill in connection with acquisitions  the impact of this new policy on our future reported results could be material results of operations twelve month periods ended december  and our operations generated revenues of  in  an increase of  or  as compared to revenues 
same store revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  as compared to the same period in new store revenues for were  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases in patient volume 
revenues generated from patients under the medicare and medicaid programs respectively accounted for and of total revenues for  compared to and of total revenues for revenues from any other single third party payor were not significant in relation to our total revenues 
during  same store inpatient days  outpatient visits  surgical cases and diagnostic cases increased   and  respectively 
revenue per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case for same store operations decreased increased by   and  respectively 
operating unit expenses expenses excluding corporate general and administrative expenses  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization and interest expense were  or of revenues  for  compared to of revenues for same store operating expenses for were  or of related revenues 
new store operating expenses were  or of related revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in included in corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  this expense item included write offs of investments and notes of  expenses related to year remediation of  and expenses related to the proposed spin off of our inpatient operations of  as part of our evaluation of the proposed spin off in  we determined that certain notes and investments totaling  should be written off 
the year remediation expenditures were incurred during while testing for year compliance 
excluding the non recurring expense  as a percentage of revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses increased from in to in total operating expenses were  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for included in the provision for doubtful accounts is  in non recurring expense recognized in the third quarter of and  in non recurring expense recognized in the fourth quarter of the third quarter provision includes the charge off of accounts receivable of facilities included in the impairment and restructuring charges we recognized in these accounts receivable were determined to be uncollectible by local and regional operations management personnel who assumed collection responsibilities in the third quarter of in connection with the restructuring of our outpatient regional business offices  which had previously been responsible for collection activities 
because local and regional operations personnel were more directly involved in interactions with the account obligors primarily insurance companies and other third party payors  management determined that their assessment of the collectibility of accounts in view of the specific payor environments in particular markets more accurately reflected the likelihood of collectibility than information derived from the centralized regional business offices 
the fourth quarter charge reflected management s decision to adopt a more conservative approach in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts in view of the information obtained by local and regional operations personnel 
this approach focused more heavily upon the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility  as opposed to determining an estimate based primarily on historical write off rates 
due to a deterioration of the payor environment  including recent payor insolvencies and an increasing tendency of payors to dispute claims  pay claims beyond the time limits contractually allowed or take discounts in excess of those contractually allowed  our days sales outstanding at the end of the second quarter of had grown to days 
our subsequent reviews uncovered significant volumes of denied or pended claims 
further commitment to collecting these older receivables would have diluted our effectiveness in collecting current  ongoing accounts 
accordingly  we revised our previous estimates of collectibility to reflect the new policy 
excluding the non recurring charge  the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for  compared to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the full amortization of certain intangible assets 
interest expense increased to  in  compared to  for  primarily attributable to increases in effective interest rates see liquidity and capital resources 
for  interest income was  compared to  for income before minority interests and income taxes for was  compared to  for minority interests reduced income before income taxes by  in  compared to  for the provision for income taxes for was  compared to  for excluding the tax effects of the impairment and restructuring charges in  the effective tax rate for and was see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net income for was  twelve month periods ended december  and our operations generated revenues of  in  an increase of  or  as compared to revenues

new store operating expenses were  or of related revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in included in corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  related to the settlement of litigation with the united states department of justice 
excluding the non recurring expense  as a percentage of revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses increased from in to in total operating expenses were  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for included in the provision for doubtful accounts is approximately  due to the charge off of a portion of the accounts receivable of our richmond  virginia medical center  which we sold in the second quarter of while we retained the facility s accounts receivable  we were dependent on the purchaser to collect the retained accounts receivable for us because it controlled the underlying information and collection systems related to such accounts  and the charge off reflects our estimate of the shortfall resulting from our inability to control the collection activity 
excluding the non recurring charge  the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for  compared to  for the increase was primarily attributable to our investment in additional assets 
interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  for see liquidity and capital resources 
for  interest income was  compared to  for the changes in interest income and interest expense for were primarily attributable to decreases in effective interest rates 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a loss of  related to the write off of unamortized balances of loan fees on a secondary credit facility we had established in and which we elected to terminate before its stated maturity in these fees were being amortized over the original term of the facility prior to our decision to terminate the facility early 
as described above  we recorded a net non recurring expense item in the second quarter of of approximately  reflecting the loss on the sale of our richmond  virginia medical center and our occupational medicine operations in that quarter 
we recorded a net non recurring expense item in the fourth quarter of of approximately  related to the loss on the sale of our united kingdom diagnostic facilities and the sale of four of our inpatient facilities in that quarter 
we recorded a net non recurring expense item in the fourth quarter of of approximately  related to the loss on a sale leaseback transaction involving thirteen of our facilities 
the thirteen facilities included five rehabilitation hospitals  two surgery centers and six diagnostic centers 
income before minority interests and income taxes for was  compared to  for minority interests reduced income before income taxes by  in  compared to  for the decrease in minority interest expense is due primarily to our repurchase of partnership interests in some of our surgery centers in order to resyndicate those interests to new partners that we believe will enhance the operations of those surgery centers 
the provision for income taxes for was  compared to  for excluding the tax effects of the impairment and restructuring charges in  the effective tax rate for and was see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net income for was  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of  including cash and marketable securities of  working capital at december  was  including cash and marketable securities of  for  cash provided by operations was  compared to  for the change was primarily due to a decrease in net income and growth in inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets 
for  investing activities used  compared to using  for the change was primarily due to decreased purchases of property  plant and equipment and also reflects net proceeds of  received from the sale of certain facilities 
additions to property  plant and equipment and acquisitions accounted for  and  respectively  during those same investing activities accounted for  and  respectively  in financing activities used  and provided  during and  respectively 
the change is primarily due to the use of funds to pay down our bank debt in net principal payments on long term debt for were  compared to net borrowing proceeds for of  net accounts receivable were  at december   compared to  at december  the number of days of average quarterly revenues in ending receivables was at december   compared to at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the concentration of net accounts receivable from patients  third party payors  insurance companies and others at december  and we have a  revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and other participating banks the credit agreement 
interest on the credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin  a base rate  or competitively bid rates from the participating banks 
we are required to pay a fee based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined credit ratings 
the principal amount is payable in full on june  we have provided a negative pledge on all assets under the credit agreement 
the effective interest rate on the average outstanding balance under the credit agreement was for the twelve months ended december   compared to the average prime rate of during the same period 
at december   we had drawn  under the credit agreement 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on march   we issued  in convertible subordinated debentures due an additional  principal amount of the convertible debentures was issued on march  to cover underwriters overallotments 
interest is payable on april and october the convertible debentures are convertible into healthsouth common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a a subdivision  combination or reclassification of outstanding shares of our common stock  b the payment of a stock dividend or stock distribution on any shares of our capital stock  c the issuance of rights or warrants to all holders of our common stock entitling them to purchase shares of our common stock at less than the current market price  or d the payment of certain other distributions with respect to our common stock 
in addition  we may  from time to time  lower the conversion price for periods of not less than days  in our discretion 
we used net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
the convertible debentures mature on april  on june   we issued  in senior notes due and  in senior notes due collectively  the senior notes 
interest is payable on june and december the senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
the senior notes mature on june  and june  on september   we issued  in senior subordinated notes due the notes 
interest is payable on april and october the notes are senior subordinated obligations of healthsouth and  as such  are subordinated to all our existing and future senior indebtedness  and also are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and partnerships 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to redeem the notes and to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
the notes mature on october  on february   we issued  in senior notes due the notes 
interest is payable on february and august the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities 
the notes mature on february  on september   we issued  in senior notes due the notes 
interest is payable on april and october the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to pay down indebtedness under our credit facilities 
the notes mature on october  on september   we issued  in senior notes due the notes 
interest is payable on april and october the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to pay down indebtedness under our credit facilities 
the notes mature on october  during and  we entered into two tax retention operating lease agreements structured through financial institutions for our corporate headquarters building and for nine of our rehabilitation hospitals 
these agreements have a total value of  and terminate on june  at termination  unless we renegotiate and extend the leases  we must purchase the facilities or obtain a purchaser for them 
we provide a residual value guaranty of approximately  related to these lease agreements 
in december  we entered into a seven and one half year operating lease agreement to provide for the financing of our replacement medical center in birmingham  alabama 
during the construction period  we provide a residual value guaranty for up to of the value of the improvements 
at december   the value of the improvements totaled approximately  at maturity  our residual value guaranty will total of the value of the improvements 
the table below sets forth certain information concerning amounts due with respect to our long term debt and various other commitments as of december  due due due due total and beyond long term debt      capital lease obligations      noncompete obligations     operating leases      total obligations      while the rates of interest payable under our principal credit facility and payments under some of our operating leases vary depending in part on investment ratings of our debt  we have no credit or lease agreements which provide for the acceleration of maturities or the termination of such agreements based upon any change in our investment rating 
we intend to pursue the acquisition or development of additional healthcare operations and related businesses  including outpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  ambulatory surgery centers  outpatient diagnostic centers and companies engaged in the provision of other complementary services  and to expand certain of our existing facilities 
while it is not possible to estimate precisely the amounts that will actually be expended in the foregoing areas  we anticipate that over the next twelve months  we will spend approximately  to  on maintenance and expansion of our existing facilities and approximately  to  on development activities  and on continued development of the integrated service model 
see item  business company strategy 
although we are continually considering and evaluating acquisitions and opportunities for future growth  we have not entered into any agreements with respect to material future acquisitions 
we believe that existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  and  together with the proceeds from potential capital markets transactions as market conditions indicate  for the reasonably foreseeable future 
inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on our business  and is not expected to adversely affect us in the future unless it increases significantly 
exposures to market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the impact on earnings and value of market risk sensitive financial instruments principally marketable security investments and long term debt  as well as the interest rate swaps described below is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate these impacts 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
our investment in marketable securities was  at december   compared to  at december  the investment represents less than of total assets at december  and these securities are generally short term  highly liquid instruments and  accordingly  their fair value approximates cost 
earnings on investments in marketable securities are not significant to our results of operations  and therefore any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on future pre tax earnings 
as described below  a significant portion of our long term indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest  generally equal to libor plus a predetermined percentage 
in october  we entered into three short term interest rate swap arrangements intended to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates in the capital markets 
two of these arrangements had a notional amount of  and one has a notional amount of  these matured six months and twelve months  respectively  from the date of the original transaction 
the notional amounts were used to measure interest to be paid or received and did not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
in each of these arrangements  we paid the counterparty a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount  and the counterparty paid us a variable rate of interest equal to the day libor rate 
the variable rates paid to us by the counterparty on the six month maturities and the twelve month maturity were reset once and three times  respectively  during the term of the swaps 
thus  these interest rate swaps had the effect of fixing the interest rates on an aggregate of  of our variable rate debt through their maturity dates 
the arrangements matured at various dates in april and november in  the weighted average interest rate we were obligated to pay under the swaps was  and the weighted average interest rate we received was 
at december   we had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  approximately  in long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
this compares to  in long term debt subject to variable rates of interest and  in long term debt subject to fixed rates of interest at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further description 
the fair value of our total long term debt  based on discounted cash flow analyses  approximates its carrying value at december  except for the convertible debentures  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes  senior notes and senior notes 
the fair value of the convertible debentures at december  was approximately  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately  the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currency  are currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
eliminates the use of the pooling method for business combinations and requires that all acquisitions be accounted for under the purchase method
