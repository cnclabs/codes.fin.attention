item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnect systems 
the company s customers include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators  electronic manufacturing service companies  electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic original equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the sales and earnings growth that the company achieved during its and fiscal years halted in the fiscal year as a result of a severe correction and downturn in the global electronics industry 
the company s sales declined dramatically in the fiscal year ended march   with steep declines in sales by the company s north american  european and asian operations 
the company s sales volumes during the fiscal year were less than one half of the sales levels during the fiscal year  and the company reported a substantial loss in the fiscal year 
the company s sales growth during the and fiscal years was attributable to increased sales of electronic materials in north america  excluding the loss of sales to delco electronics  discussed below  and in europe and asia 
the company s ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines were significant factors in the growth of the company s sales of electronic materials 
the company s earnings increased during each of the and fiscal years  despite the significant losses in the fiscal year incurred by the company s mass lamination business in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics and despite the significant charges related to the closure and the write down of the assets of the plumbing hardware business and the fiscal year operating loss of that business 
in the fiscal year  the company s earnings reached record levels as a result of the surge in demand for the company s electronic materials products throughout the global electronics markets served by the company and the company s continuing emphasis on its higher technology product lines 
growth of the company s electronic materials business was constrained during the and fiscal years by the company s available manufacturing capacity  although the company has been expanding the manufacturing capacity of its electronic materials facilities in recent years 
nevertheless  all the company s electronic materials facilities were operating at full capacity during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year  the company completed expansions of its electronic materials operations in singapore and france  acquired additional manufacturing capacity in california  and commenced significant additional expansions of its electronic materials operations in california and new york  which it completed in its fiscal year 
during the fiscal year  the company commenced a significant expansion of its higher technology product line manufacturing facility in arizona  which it completed in the fiscal year first quarter 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total worldwide sales were to delco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nelco technology  inc nti located in tempe  arizona  had been delco s principal supplier of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials  commonly known as mass lamination  which were used by delco to produce finished multilayer printed circuit boards 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the remainder of the fiscal year and have been nil since that time 
in may  the company and nti filed a complaint against delco electronics corporation and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
the company and nti sought substantial compensatory and punitive damages 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of  both parties filed motions for post judgment relief and a new trial  all of which the judge denied  and both parties have appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco 
after march  the business of nti languished and its performance was unsatisfactory due primarily to the absence of the unique  high volume  high quality business that had been provided by delco electronics and the absence of any other customer in the north american electronic materials industry with a similar demand for the large volumes of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials that delco purchased from nti 
although nti s business experienced a resurgence in the fiscal year as the north american market for printed circuit materials became extremely strong and demand exceeded supply for the electronic materials manufactured by the company  the company s internal expectations and projections for the nti business were for continuing volatility in the business performance over the foreseeable future 
consequently  the company commenced efforts to sell the business in the second half of its fiscal year  and in april  the company sold the assets and business of nti and closed a related support facility  also located in tempe  arizona 
in connection with the sale and closure  the company recorded non recurring  pre tax charges of million in its fiscal year first quarter ended may  as a result of this sale  the company exited the mass lamination business in north america 
although the company s electronic materials business was not dependent on this single customer  the loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on this business in the last three fiscal years 
the company is not engaged in any related party transactions involving relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with the company or the company s related parties  or in any transactions with parties with whom the company or its related parties have a relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of material transactions that may or would not be available from other  more clearly independent parties on an arm s length basis  or in any trading activities involving non exchange traded commodity or other contracts that are accounted for at fair value or otherwise or in any energy trading or risk management activities  other than certain limited foreign currency contracts intended to hedge the company s contractual commitments to pay certain obligations or to realize certain receipts in foreign currencies 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company experienced a sharp decline in its results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  as the north american  european and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials experienced severe downturns during such periods 
in addition to its severely depressed results of operations  during the fiscal year first quarter  the company incurred non recurring  pre tax charges of million in connection with the sale of the assets and business of nti and the closure of a related support facility in arizona and million in connection with workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations 
the company also incurred pre tax charges during the fiscal year third quarter totaling million in connection with the realignment of the operations of its german subsidiary  dielektra gmbh  the company s electronic materials business located in cologne  germany 
the realignment included the closure of dielektra s conventional lamination line to enable it to better focus its efforts and capabilities on its unique datlamt automated continuous lamination and paneling manufacturing technology and the reduction of the size of its mass lamination operations in order to focus on the marketing and manufacturing of high technology  higher layer count mass lamination product 
the company incurred an additional  in pre tax charges during the third quarter for a workforce reduction at another business unit 
the significant reduction in the company s sales of electronic materials was largely responsible for the severe decline in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american  european and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials collapsed during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in each region suffered as a result  although the company believes it gained market share with certain of its electronic materials customers 
the company s results of operations and margins declined in the fiscal year principally as a result of the electronic material business decrease in sales of all products and the concomitant operation of the company s facilities at levels far below their designed manufacturing capacity 
operating results of the company s specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite materials businesses also declined during the fiscal year 
this decline was attributable to lower volumes of products sold 
while the company s sales volumes during the fiscal year were only about of the robust sales volumes achieved by the company during the fiscal year  the company has experienced a small improvement in its sales levels during the months of january through april compared to the preceding seven months 
the company believes this improvement is attributable to market share gains and to improvements in the business of the company s customers 
however  the company cannot predict whether this small improvement is sustainable or to ascertain whether the global electronics industry is in fact beginning to recover 
results of operations net sales for the fiscal year ended march  declined to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  this decline in sales was the result of lower unit volumes of materials shipped and the absence of sales by nti  which  as described above  the company sold in the fiscal year first quarter 
although the net sales of nti during the fiscal year were material relative to the company s consolidated net sales during such year  the operations of nti were not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  capital resources or liquidity  and the sale of nti is not expected to have any material effect on the company s future operating results  financial position  capital resources  liquidity or continuing operations 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year decreased from the fiscal year 
the decrease in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was due to decreases in sales in both asia and europe 
the overall gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the deterioration in the gross margin was attributable to the significant declines in sales volumes from the fiscal year  the absence of growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products  which was only slightly offset by increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacity 
although the company s cost of sales decreased significantly as a result of lower production volumes and cost reduction measures implemented by the company  including significant workforce reductions  the reduction of overtime and the decision to not implement annual salary increases  the declines in sales and production volumes resulted in lower volumes to absorb fixed overhead costs and  consequently  an increase in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in the fiscal year 
although selling  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the fiscal year resulted from proportionately lower sales compared to the fiscal year 
for the reasons set forth above  for the fiscal year  income from operations  including the non recurring  pre tax charges  described above  related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  the sale of nti and the closure of a related support facility and severance for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations  declined to a loss of million  and income from operations  before the non recurring  pre tax charges  declined to a loss of million  in both cases compared to a profit of million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  net  principally investment income  declined to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the decrease in investment income was attributable to the reduction in cash available for investment and lower prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments 
the company incurred no interest expense during the fiscal year compared with million during the fiscal year 
the company s interest expense was related primarily to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due  issued in   principal amount of which was converted into  shares of the company s common stock prior to february  the end of the company s fiscal year   of which was converted into  shares of the company s common stock on march   and  of which was redeemed by the company for cash on march  see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year and the fiscal year 
net earnings for the fiscal year  including the non recurring  pre tax charges  described above  related to the realignment of the operations of the company s german business unit  the sale of nti and the closure of a related support facility and severance for workforce reductions at the company s continuing operations  declined to a net loss of million  and net earnings  before the non recurring  pre tax charges  declined to a net loss of million  in both cases from net earnings of million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased from and  respectively  for the fiscal year to a loss per share of including the non recurring  pre tax charges and to a loss per share of before the non recurring  pre tax charges for the fiscal year 
the declines in net earnings and earnings per share were primarily attributable to the decline in the profit from operations and the charge for the closure of the business unit in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics corporation with semi finished multilayer circuit boards 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was largely responsible for the dramatic improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended february  the north american  asian and european markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials were extremely strong during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in all three geographic areas performed well as a result 
the company s results of operations and margins improved in the fiscal year principally as a result of the optimal utilization of the electronic materials business manufacturing resources and the business increase in its market share with certain key customers and increase in its sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
results of operations net sales for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  this increase in sales was principally the result of higher volume of materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
the increase in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was due to increases in sales by both the asian and european operations of the company 
the gross margin for the company s continuing worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the increase in the gross margin was attributable to efficiencies achieved by operating facilities at levels close to their designed capacity in the fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products as a percentage of total sales and increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this decrease was a result of the partially fixed nature of these expenses and the company s increased sales in the fiscal year 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to increased cash available for investment and higher prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with million during the fiscal year 
the company s interest expense was related primarily to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due issued in february see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a change in the company s income mix among the tax jurisdictions in which the company does business 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations offset  in part  by the higher effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at february   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the decrease in the company s cash and investment position at march  was attributable to reduced cash provided from operating activities and cash used for the purchase of fixed assets  as discussed below 
the company s working capital which includes cash and temporary investments was million at march  compared with million at february  the decrease at march  compared with february  was due principally to lower cash and temporary investments  accounts receivable and inventories  offset in part by lower current liabilities 
the decrease in accounts receivable  inventories and current liabilities at march  compared with february  was a result principally of reduced operating activity in support of lower sales volumes 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at march  compared with to at february  during the fiscal year  cash provided by the company s operations  before depreciation and amortization and before non cash losses related to the sale and impairment of fixed assets  of million was enhanced by a significant net reduction in working capital items  resulting in million of cash provided from operating activities 
a major portion of the fiscal year s capital expenditures related to the expansions of the company s electronic materials facilities in arizona  california and new york 
these expansions increased the company s capacity and capability for the production of sophisticated printed circuit materials 
net expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the company expects the capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be less than the expenditures in the fiscal year and in the fiscal year 
at march   the company had no long term debt 
during the company s fiscal year   principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  and immediately after the end of the fiscal year   principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  all at a conversion price of per share 
on march   the company redeemed  principal amount of notes for a redemption price of  including accrued interest for each  principal amount note pursuant to a previous announcement that on march  it would redeem all of the outstanding notes that were not converted on or before march  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
the company s liquidity is not dependent on the use of  and the company is not engaged in  any off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of the operating lease commitments described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company has no long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments  other than a standby letter of credit in the amount of  to secure the company s obligations under its workers compensation insurance program 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at march   the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million compared with million at february management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other employee benefit programs  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality electronic materials and other products possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
however  if the quality of the company s products declined  the company may incur higher sales allowances 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
restructuring during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded significant reserves in connection with the restructuring relating to the sale of nelco technology  inc  the closure of a related support facility and the realignment of dielektra  gmbh 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from the company s actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs incurred by the company may differ from these estimates 
contingencies and litigation the company is subject to a small number of proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  employment  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
pension and other employee benefit programs the company s subsidiary in europe has significant pension costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and wage inflation rates 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and wage costs  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs may occur in the future in addition to changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s related headcount due to changes in the assumptions 
the company s obligations for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits are effectively self insured 
the company uses an insurance company administrator to process all such claims and benefits 
the company accrues its workers compensation liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator and historical experience 
the company s employee health insurance benefit liability is based on its historical claims experience 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a non contributory profit sharing retirement plan covering their regular full time employees 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries have various bonus and incentive compensation programs  most of which are determined at management s discretion 
the company s reserves associated with these self insured liabilities and benefit programs are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
factors that may affect future results 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
certain portions of this report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from park s expectations or from results which might be projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking statements 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking statements 

the company s customer base is concentrated  in part  because the company s business strategy has been to develop long term relationships with a select group of customers 
during the company s fiscal year ended march   the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
a loss of one or more of such key customers could affect the company s profitability 
see business electronic materials operations customers and end markets in item of this report  legal proceedings in item of this report and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report for discussions of the loss of a key cus tomer early in the fiscal year 

the company s business is dependent on certain aspects of the electronics industry  which is a cyclical industry and which has experienced recurring downturns 
the downturns  such as occurred in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ended march  and in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ended march   can be unexpected and have often reduced demand for  and prices of  electronic materials 

the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including various factors beyond the company s control 
such factors include economic conditions in the electronics industry  the timing of customer orders  product prices  process yields  the mix of products sold and maintenance related shutdowns of facilities 
operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products and the costs associated with the start up of new facilities 

the company s production processes require the use of substantial amounts of gas and electricity  the cost and available supply of which are beyond the control of the company 
changes in the cost or availability of gas or electricity could materially increase the company s cost of operations 

rapid technological advances in semiconductors and electronic equipment have placed rigorous demands on the electronic materials manufactured by the company and used in printed circuit board production 
the company s operating results will be affected by the company s ability to maintain and increase its technological and manufacturing capability and expertise in this rapidly changing industry 

the electronic materials industry is intensely competitive and the company competes worldwide in the market for materials used in the production of complex multilayer printed circuit boards 
the company s principal competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company  and the company s operating results will be affected by its ability to maintain its competitive position in the industry 

there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of the principal materials used by the company in its manufacture of electronic materials products 
substitutes for these products are not readily available  and in the recent past there have been shortages in the market for certain of these materials 

the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments 
instead  it relies primarily on continual communication with its customers to anticipate the future volume of purchase orders 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  can cause a customer to reduce or delay orders previously anticipated by the company 

the company  from time to time  is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities for electronic materials 
the anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted 
in addition  such expansions will increase the company s fixed costs 
the company s future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 

the company s business is capital intensive and  in addition  the introduction of new technologies could substantially increase the company s capital expenditures 
in order to remain competitive the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment and expansion of operations 
this may require that the company continue to be able to access capital on terms acceptable to the company 

the company may acquire businesses  product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the company 
the integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the company s management resources and technical  financial and operating systems 
in addition  implementation of acquisitions can result in large one time charges and costs 
a given acquisition  if consummated  may materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

the company s international operations are subject to risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 

a portion of the sales and costs of the company s international operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the company s success is dependent upon its relationship with key management and technical personnel 

the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property which the company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions  trade secret protections  copyrights and patents 

the company s production processes require the use  storage  treatment and disposal of certain materials which are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and the company is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such materials and the release of emissions and effluents into the environment 
other possible developments  such as the enactment or adoption of additional environmental laws  could result in substantial costs to the company 

the market price of the company s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the electronic materials industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 

the company s results could be affected by changes in the company s accounting policies and practices or changes in the company s organization  compensation and benefit plans  or changes in the company s material agreements or understandings with third parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s primary foreign currency exchange exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries using currencies other than the us dollar as their functional currency 
the company does not believe that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates to the company s short term investment portfolio 
this investment portfolio is managed by outside professional managers in accordance with guidelines issued by the company 
these guidelines are designed to establish a high quality fixed income portfolio of government and highly rated corporate debt securities with a maximum weighted maturity of less than one year 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
based on the average maturity of the investment portfolio at the end of the fiscal year a increase in short term interest rates would not have had a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company
