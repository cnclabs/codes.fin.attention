item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we opened our first store in we grew to nine stores in colorado by fiscal and then adopted an expansion strategy to enter new markets in the rocky mountain  midwest and southwest regions 
by the end of fiscal  we had grown to stores 
in june  we acquired audio king corporation  a consumer electronics specialty retailer with retail stores in minnesota  iowa and south dakota 
we then opened one store in fiscal  one store in fiscal  five stores in fiscal and ten stores in fiscal we currently operate stores in states 
we plan to open to stores in fiscal we have signed leases for of these store locations  nine of which are in the dallas fort worth market and two of which are in the st 
louis market 
we expect to open approximately to new stores in fiscal our investment cost for large format stores opened in the last two fiscal years has been approximately million per store  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  inventory net of payables and preopening expenses 
our large format stores have typically been profitable on a store operating basis within their first months of operation and  on average  return our investment in months or less 
the timing of our new store openings and relocations will significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity  and are therefore considered critical 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or such merchandise is delivered to the customer 
sales  which includes net warranty revenue  consists of gross sales less discounts  price guarantees  returns and allowances 
we grant credit to customers through independent  third party finance companies  who assume the credit risk for the collection of the related accounts receivable 
during fiscal  approximately of our total sales were to customers who financed their purchases using our private label and manufacturer sponsored credit cards 
when we offer interest free promotions  we normally pay a fee at the time of the transaction 
this fee averages between and of the amount financed by the customer 
we sell extended warranty contracts on behalf of a fully insured unrelated party 
the contracts extend beyond the normal manufacturer s warranty period  usually with terms of coverage including the manufacturer s warranty period between and months 
the extended warranty contracts are administered by a third party and all performance obligations and risk of loss with respect to such contracts are the responsibility of such administrator and other parties 
effective february   we restructured our extended warranty master contract with the administrator 
for extended warranty contracts entered into after february   we are a non obligor and  therefore  we recognize commissions from the sale of these non obligor contracts as revenues at the time of sale to customers 
we are deemed to be the obligor under the extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   and we recognize revenues over the term of these obligor contracts  generally to months 
revenues from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   will be amortized in decreasing amounts through fiscal advertising costs and cooperative revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  reporting on advertising costs  all advertising costs are deferred until the first time the advertising takes place 
in addition  we accrue rebates based upon specified percentages of inventory purchases and record such amounts as a reduction of advertising expense 
certain rebates are based on projected volumes of purchases from related vendors  reflecting product demand in each of our markets 
although our projections have historically been representative of actual purchases  changes in market or economic conditions in specific markets where we operate could have a material impact on the realization of the recorded rebate receivables and reductions of advertising expense 
we also deduct amounts for cooperative advertising directly from payment to manufacturers for inventory purchases based on individual agreements with our manufacturers 
net advertising expense charged to operations was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
inventories we state merchandise inventories at the lower of cost weighted average cost or market 
significant management judgement is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand because a product may either be discontinued or become technologically outdated earlier than anticipated 
inventories are presented net of an allowance for obsolescence of million and  at january  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to sales percentage of sales for the years ended january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes and extraordinary items income tax expense income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
for the year ended january   sales were million  a increase from sales of million for the prior year 
the increase in sales during fiscal was primarily due to sales from the new stores opened during the year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of for the year due to a sluggish economy and weak consumer confidence 
in the first three quarters of fiscal  we experienced negative single digit comparable store sales  a trend that was further aggravated by the terrorist attacks on september  we generated a comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter due to improved consumer confidence and increased demand for digital products 
revenues from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   will be amortized in decreasing amounts through fiscal gross profit 
costs of goods sold includes merchandise costs  buying costs and warehousing and distribution costs less vendor purchase discounts and volume rebates 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to higher than expected inventory shrinkage in the fourth quarter  reduced amortization of warranties sold prior to february   and the continued shift in merchandise mix to lower margin categories 
this decrease was partially offset by higher margins in most product categories 
over the last three years  we have experienced a continued shift in our merchandise mix from higher margin products such as audio and mobile electronics to lower margin products such as television and dvd 
for example  sales of audio products have decreased from of total sales during fiscal to of total sales in fiscal  while sales of televisions have increased from of total sales during fiscal to of total sales in fiscal this shift in merchandise mix has negatively impacted our gross profit margins 
at the same time  our gross margins in most product categories have increased  which has offset the decrease in our gross profit margins due to the shift in merchandise mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include net advertising costs  occupancy costs  payroll  depreciation  computer costs and all other expenses necessary to operate our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased occupancy costs for new stores  additions in personnel to facilitate our expansion  increased net advertising expenses incurred as we entered three new markets over the past two years and lower than planned comparable store sales growth for the year 
income from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations decreased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal interest expense

the increase in sales during fiscal was due primarily to the five new stores opened during the year as well as the comparable store sales increase

gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the improvement in gross profit was due primarily to increased sales of new digital technology products  margin improvements in almost every product category  partially offset by a lower mix of higher margin categories such as audio and mobile electronics  increased sales of high margin installation services  and amortization of warranty income in the amount of million of sales

new stores opened comparable store sales operating results are dependent upon a number of factors  including discretionary consumer spending  which is affected by local  regional and national economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including comparable store sales and the success of new stores  the timing of new store openings and store relocations  the amount of store preopening expenses  the amount of grand opening expenses incurred in new markets  weather conditions in our markets  the mix of consumer electronics products sold in our stores  the availability of new products  and actions by our competitors  including grand opening and store closing sales by competitors 
as we have opened additional stores within markets we already serve  sales at existing stores have been adversely affected 
such adverse effects may occur in the future 
in the past  we have experienced significant variability in preopening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of new store openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening costs associated with a given store in the three months prior to its opening 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns 
as is the case with many other retailers  our sales and profits have been greatest in the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our expansion have been net cash from operations  revolving credit lines  term debt and issuances of common stock 
our primary cash requirements are related to expenditures for new store openings and the relocation or remodeling of existing store locations 
these expenditures include leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  preopening expenses  additional inventory requirements and selling  general and administrative expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities equaled million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities over the past year was primarily the result of higher accounts payable balances in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  primarily related to capital expenditures for new store openings  the installation of warehouse management software  the reconfiguration and expansion of our warehouse and distribution center and implementation of our new management information system 
in february  we completed a sale and leaseback transaction with a related party for our store in colorado springs  colorado 
see certain relationships and related transactions 
in october  we increased the size of our main warehouse and distribution center in thornton  colorado by  square feet 
for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million 
we incurred capital expenditures of million during fiscal  primarily for new store openings and the relocation and expansion of an existing store  which was partially offset by receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of an investment available for sale acquired with the proceeds from our public offering in fiscal we expect capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  primarily for new store openings  a remodel of our fort collins  colorado store and implementation of our new management information system 
we have signed leases for new store locations 
the cost of new stores is anticipated to average approximately million per store during fiscal  which amount includes leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  inventory net of payables and preopening expenses 
leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment are expected to average approximately million per store  depending on tenant allowances 
the inventory requirement for each new store is expected to average approximately million  approximately  of which will be financed through trade credit from our vendors 
preopening expenses for new stores are expected to average approximately  and include costs for advertising prior to opening and recruitment and training of new employees 
if we relocate existing stores  preopening costs are expected to average  and will be higher if we are required to terminate existing store leases prior to their maturity 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million to complete the implementation of our new management information system 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal related primarily to net borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
net cash used in financing activities for the prior year was primarily the result of repayment  in full  of our bonds on march   partially offset by borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
on september   we executed a three year million credit agreement  as amended  with foothill capital corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of wells fargo bank 
borrowings under this revolving line of credit were limited to the lesser of million or of eligible inventory and a portion of accounts receivable 
this credit agreement was replaced on september  when we entered into a three year million credit agreement with wells fargo finance  llc 
on december   we amended the agreement to increase the credit limit to million 
borrowings under this revolving line of credit are limited to the lesser of i million and ii of eligible inventory plus the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable and million 
amounts borrowed bear interest  payable monthly  based on a blend of i libor plus to and ii wells fargo bank s prime rate minus 
our weighted average interest rate was at january  inventories  accounts receivable  equipment and intangibles secure the borrowings 
the facility includes negative covenants that places restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  enter into mergers and consolidations  pay dividends  repurchase our capital stock  issue guarantees  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates without the written consent of the bank 
the facility also contains covenants regarding our gross margins  inventory levels  tangible net worth and capital expenditures 
effective december   we amended the agreement with respect to the capital expenditures covenant 
we are in compliance with all loan covenants 
as of january   we had a borrowing base of million  of which million was outstanding 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and expansion through fiscal to fund our capital requirements beyond that time  we may be required to seek additional financing  which could include an increase in our revolving line of credit or additional debt or equity financings 
we may also remortgage our thornton facility 
we may not be able to obtain such funds on favorable terms  if at all 
the following table reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations payments due by period less than year years years over years total in thousands capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase commitments   construction commitments   other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration by period less than year years years over years total in thousands revolving line of credit   the principal balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit was million as of january  all amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit will need to be repaid on september   unless our line of credit is renewed 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on results of operations during the last few years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas in june  the financial accounting and standards board issued statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas  which was adopted by us on february  sfas requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income
