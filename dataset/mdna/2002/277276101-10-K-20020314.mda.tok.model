item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s management considers the following accounting policies to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction  property taxes and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
indirect costs allocated to development projects are based on management s estimates and assumptions 
the company reviews its real estate investments to be held and used for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit review and analysis on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  aged receivables  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts

inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long term debt maturities 
this debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has several variable rate bank lines as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
the table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates for both the fixed rate and variable rate debt

the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by or approximately basis points  interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately  annually
