the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview the company s principal business is conducted by the banks and consists of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  other income  and other expenses 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains  mortgage origination fees  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust fees  and other income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  marketing expenses  and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the company s asset liability management procedures in coping with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is dependent upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
other expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new banking centers and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage  and other miscellaneous expenses 
during  the economic expansion ended  and the economy entered a recession 
the federal reserve cut key interest rates eleven times resulting in a basis points reduction in interest rates 
the sharp decline in interest rates adversely impacted the company s net interest income as its prime rate based loans were immediately repriced downward with each cut in interest rates while its deposit interest rates lagged in the repricing cycle 
in addition  falling mortgage interest rates and prepayment of both mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities resulted in lower yields earned on the company s investment portfolio due in part to an acceleration of premium amortization 
the tragic events of september th have further aggravated the economy 
the company s net income is dependent in part on stable interest rates

the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased from in to for in  the interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures for a full year was recognized 
the primary reason for the decrease in net interest margin was that yields on earnings assets decreased more than the yields on interest bearing liabilities 
repricing opportunities on core deposits and certificates of deposits are expected to offset any unfavorable impact from future interest rate reductions in the near term 
in the first quarter of  million in certificates of deposit at a weighted average rate of will mature and are expected to reprice at lower rates assuming no spike in interest rates 
the company expects net interest income and net interest margin to improve during provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  to million in from million in as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  and was equal to of nonperforming loans 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward nonperforming and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is also given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of impaired and other nonperforming loans  historical loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  independent loan review  the market value of collateral  the estimate of discounted cash flows  the strength and availability of guaranties  concentrations of credits  and other factors

nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance  however these loans are not earning any interest 
changes in interest income and expense the changes in net interest income from period to period are reflective of changes in the interest rate environment  changes in the composition of assets and liabilities as to type and maturity and the inherent interest rate differences related thereto  and volume changes 
later sections of this discussion and analysis address the changes in maturity composition of loans and investments and in the asset and liability repricing gaps associated with interest rate risk  all of which contribute to changes in net interest margin

commercial real estate loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
the company has increased its lending efforts in this area while maintaining firm underwriting standards 
the company has added lending personnel to assist in this growth 
the increase in commercial real estate loans reflects continued growth in the commercial real estate market  increased commitments with existing borrowers  and market penetration and market share growth as a result of these efforts 
agricultural loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
the increase in agricultural loans reflects increased market share in west central illinois 
consumer real estate loans increased  to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
the increase reflects the company s desire to originate medium term  fixed rate  and adjustable rate residential loans for its portfolio 
consumer installment loans decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december   a decrease of although the risk of nonpayment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the quality of the borrower s management and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type  such as commercial or residential  and fluctuating land values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan  as well as face the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
at the end of  the company had of its loan portfolio in commercial and consumer real estate loans  of these real estate loans are variable rate and of these real estate loans are fixed rate 
the company believes that most credits should have both a primary and a secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be supported by operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be disposition of collateral 
the company engages in very little unsecured lending and generally requires personal guarantees of principals for business obligations 
the company practices a system of concurrence in the approval of commercial credit whereby the documented approval of an officer s credit committee or approval by the board or a board committee  where applicable is obtained in addition to that of the recommending officer 
this system is intended to ensure that commercial credit is subjected to an independent objective review on at least two different levels 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  one year years over years or less fixed variable fixed variable total in thousands commercial       commercial real estate       agricultural       consumer real estate       consumer installment    total loans  gross       unearned discount   total loans       nonperforming loans the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectibility of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all of the principal has been collected 
it is the policy of the company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status 
rather  a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 the company defined loans that are individually evaluated for impairment to include commercial loans and mortgages secured by commercial properties or five plus family residences that are in non accrual status or were restructured 
all other smaller balance loans with similar attributes such as auto are evaluated for impairment in total 
the classification of a loan as impaired or non accrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or non accrual loans 
the final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or non accrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans that are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of the related collateral by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations cause the allowance for possible loan losses to require an increase  such increase is reported as a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense 
loans are evaluated for impairment when payments are delinquent days or more or when management downgrades the loan classification to doubtful 
the following table sets forth information on the company s nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets as of the indicated dates

nonperforming loans increased  or to million at december  from million at december  other real estate declined  in from million to  total nonperforming assets declined by  from million in to million in analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the banks meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
each loan officer grades these individual commercial credits  and the company s independent loan review function validates the officers grades 
in the event that loan review downgrades the loan  it is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg  collateral value is nominal 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is comprised of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation  and subjectively by determined allocation 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas no 
and no 
 and an allocation is made based on this analysis 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the credit rating of the loan 
the subjective portion is determined based on loan history and the company s evaluation of various factors including economic and industry outlooks 
in addition  the subjective portion of the allowance is influenced by current economic conditions and trends in the portfolio including delinquencies and impairments  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years

the securities portfolio consists primarily of agency guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented   and of total securities as of december    and  respectively 
based upon the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are a preferable investment vehicle for the banks 
mortgage backed securities offer attractive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral  and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
the banks investment strategies during the past three years have been focused on the purchase of seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives to years  which have been purchased at discounts  at par  and at a premium to par 
historically  management believes these securities are reasonably predictable in terms of price volatility  prepayment speeds  and monthly cash flows 
the sharp decrease in long term investment yields and  as a consequence  lower mortgage rates  led to a significant increase in prepayment speeds in and as a result  management repositioned the securities portfolio in to reduce the overall impact on yields and improve longer term profitability 
the company manages its securities available for sale portfolio and trading account portfolio on a total return basis 
in this respect  management regularly reviews the performance of its securities and sells specific securities to provide opportunities to enhance net interest income and net interest margin  and when possible it will recognize gains on the sale of securities 
the company has a long history of managing its securities in this manner

the junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the trust 
the junior subordinated debentures and the preferred securities pay distributions and dividends  respectively  on a quarterly basis  which are included in interest expense 
the junior subordinated debentures will mature on june   at which time the preferred securities must be redeemed 
the junior subordinated debentures and preferred securities can be redeemed contemporaneously  in whole or in part  beginning june  at a redemption price of per preferred security 
the company has provided a full  irrevocable  and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis of the obligations of the trust under the preferred securities in the event of the occurrence of an event of default  as defined in such guarantee 
capital resources the company monitors compliance with bank and bank holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  tier  or core capital  and total capital  which consists of tier plus tier capital 
see business supervision and regulation bank holding company regulation for definitions of tier and tier capital 
the following tables set forth the company s capital ratios as of the indicated dates 
risk based capital ratios december  amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands tier capital to risk weighted assets    tier capital minimum requirement    total capital to risk weighted assets    total capital minimum requirements    total risk weighted assets    liquidity the company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities 
in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity 
the banks have used the fhlb extensively since in  fhlb advances increased by million 
assuming that collateral is available to secure loans  each bank can borrow up to of its assets with the fhlb  which provided the banks with a total additional million in unused capacity at december  the banks also have various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to billion of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements  and brokered certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was billion at december  the banks maintain these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk  and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and also by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of earnings  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of loan and investment funding  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities  consisting principally of deposit growth and net borrowings  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
asset liability management the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities  and other securities that are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities  deposits and borrowings 
all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap with a counterparty in order to convert its million trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures from a fixed rate instrument into floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap was written to the call date on the trust preferred securities  which is june  the company will pay interest quarterly at a rate equal to the three month libor rate 
the counterparty will pay a fixed rate of for the term of the agreement 
this transaction is expected to reduce the company s interest expense by more than in the first three months of interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms  and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each of the banks internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each of the banks assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each of the banks rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each of the banks and the effects of rate changes on each of the banks earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the company s board of directors 
each of the banks also maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based upon simulation modeling  these guidelines include a change in net interest income upon an immediate or gradual basis point change in interest rates 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings  and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and asset liability management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp   base  bp   bp   net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp  base  bp  bp   as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would increase the company s net interest income by  or approximately million 
overall net interest income sensitivity has decreased slightly from to  but remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
this decreased sensitivity was due to the changes in interest rates that affected various earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net income by  or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or approximately million
