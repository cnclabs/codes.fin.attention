general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december   should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
we were incorporated in and commenced operations in july for the five year period ended december   our operating revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate  while net income increased at a compounded annual rate  including a one time  pre tax  write off recorded during of million for an investment made in a communications technology company 
the compounded annual net income growth rate for  excluding this write off  was

excluding a one time  pre tax  non cash write off of  relating to a minority investment in a communications technology company  in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased by to million in from million in this increase resulted from expansion of our customer base and increased volume from existing customers  that was facilitated by an increase in our tractor and trailer fleet  which increased by to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december  the april acquisition of john fayard fast freight  inc  renamed knight transportation gulf coast  inc  which then operated approximately tractors  contributed to the increase in revenue for  compared to average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge increased slightly to per mile for the year ended december   from per mile for the same period in salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to the increase in the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to as of december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  decreased  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in  due mainly to lower average fuel prices during compared to we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely impact operations throughout see factors that may affect future results  below 
during  we implemented a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for operations and maintenance expense increased  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the ratio of company operated vehicles to independent contractor operated vehicles 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance on their own vehicles insurance and claims expense increased  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of the increase in insurance premiums and the higher self insurance retention levels assumed by the company 
we anticipate that casualty insurance rates will continue to increase in the future and for we will retain a larger portion of our claims risks  in response to the increased insurance premiums 
see business safety risk management  above  and factors that may affect future results  below 
operating taxes and license expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for the decrease resulted primarily from a relative increase in miles run in lower tax rate states for the month period ended december  communications expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in compared to  primarily due to the purchase and utilization of new tractor and trailer communication technology 
during we purchased new qualcomm in cab communications systems to replace the in cab communication system that was discontinued by terion 
see non recurring charge below 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from in this decrease was primarily related to the increase in lease expenses incurred for revenue equipment under operating lease agreements 
lease expense  which is the expense for leased revenue equipment as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to for several lease agreements have variable payment terms which are amortized on a straight line basis 
see factors that may affect future results  below 
purchased transportation expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of a decrease in the ratio of independent contractors to company drivers 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  we have utilized independent contractors as part of our fleet expansion because independent contractors provide their own tractors 
as of december   the company had tractors owned and operated by independent contractors 
as our company owned fleet has expanded  purchased transportation has decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed per mile basis 
to assist us in continuing to attract independent contractors  we provide financing to qualified independent contractors to assist them in acquiring revenue equipment 
as of december   we had million in loans outstanding to independent contractors to purchase revenue equipment 
these loans are secured by liens on the revenue equipment we finance 
miscellaneous operating expenses  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in  primarily due to increases in bad debt reserves and increased travel expenses 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for this decrease was primarily the result of our ability to reduce our outstanding debt to approximately million at december   compared to million at december  debt reduction was facilitated  in part  by proceeds obtained from the offering of our common stock that closed november  during the third quarter of  we recorded a non recurring charge of million to record the write off of our entire investment in terion  inc terion  a communications technology company  made during and we owned less than four percent of terion and did not derive any revenue from our investment 
we elected to write off our investment after terion announced that it would cease operating its in cab communications system 
in january  terion filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
the impact on earnings per diluted share was for the year ended december  this write off resulted in a reduction of net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  of for the fiscal year ended december  as a result of terion s decision to discontinue its in cab communications business  we replaced the terion in cab units with qualcomm in cab satellite based communications systems 
income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences in income for tax purposes 
income tax expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to a change in the mix of state tax liabilities 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in this percentage was for  excluding the write off of our investment in terion  as discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased by to million in from million in this increase resulted from expansion of our customer base and increased volume from existing customers 
this was facilitated by a continued increase in our tractor and trailer fleet  including approximately tractors acquired in the april acquisition of john fayard fast freight  inc  renamed knight transportation gulf coast  inc  and tractors acquired in the march  acquisition of action delivery services  inc our fleet increased by to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december  average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge decreased to per mile for the year ended december   from per mile for the same period in equipment utilization averaged  miles per tractor in  down slightly when compared to an average of  miles per tractor in primarily due to the increase in fuel costs that we passed on to our customers 
these changes reflect increased competition in the short to medium truckload sector of the transportation business 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to the increase in the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors and increased compensation to non driving staff 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claim accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in its consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  increased as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to for from in  due mainly to higher average fuel prices during compared to we believe that higher fuel prices will continue to adversely impact operations throughout most of see factors that may affect future results  below 
also  the increase in the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors in compared to contributed to this increase 
independent contractors pay for their own fuel 
during  we implemented a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the month period ended december   fuel surcharge was  compared to  for operations and maintenance expense decreased  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to for from in this decrease was the result of improvements experienced in our equipment maintenance programs 
insurance and claims expense decreased  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for as a result of the reduction in both the frequency and severity of claims activity incurred  and favorable casualty insurance rates 
we anticipate that casualty insurance rates will increase in the future and we are retaining a larger portion of our claims risks  in response to increased insurance expense 
operating taxes and license expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for the decrease resulted primarily from a relative increase in miles run in lower tax rate states for the month period ended december  communications expenses decreased slightly  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  in compared to depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from in this decrease was related to the increase in lease expenses incurred for revenue equipment under operating lease agreements 
this decrease was also related to certain dedicated opportunities which do not require the use of certain company revenue equipment 
lease expense  which is the expense for leased revenue equipment as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to for  due to our initiation of a leasing program in to obtain additional revenue equipment 
several lease agreements have variable payment terms which are amortized on a straight line basis 
purchased transportation expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of a decrease in the ratio of independent contractors to company drivers 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  we have utilized independent contractors as part of our fleet expansion because independent contractors provide their own tractors 
as of december   the company had tractors owned and operated by independent contractors 
as the company owned fleet has expanded  purchased transportation has decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed per mile basis 
to assist us in continuing to attract independent contractors  we provide financing to qualified independent contractors to assist them in acquiring revenue equipment 
as of december   we had million in loans outstanding to independent contractors to purchase revenue equipment 
the loans are secured by liens on the revenue equipment we finance 
miscellaneous operating expenses  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in  primarily due to decreases in utilization of company equipment 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from for this increase was due to the increase in our average borrowings to million for from million for income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences in income for tax purposes 
income tax expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to a change in the mix of state tax liabilities  as well as the increase in our operating ratio to for  compared to for as a result of the preceding changes  our net income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary source of liquidity has been funds provided by operations and our lines of credit with our primary lender 
during the fourth quarter of  we registered with the securities and exchange commission and sold  shares of our common stock through a public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us of  see our registration statements on form s filed with the sec on october  file no 
 and november  file no 

the proceeds we received from this offering were used for the repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of trade ins  office equipment  land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect that capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for  will be applied primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the change from to was the result of the proceeds from the sale of common stock discussed previously  which were used primarily to reduce outstanding debt 
the change from to was primarily the result of the proceeds from the sale of notes receivable and new borrowings on the line of credit 
we maintain a line of credit totaling million with our lenders and use this line to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment and other corporate purposes to the extent our need for capital is not provided by funds from operations or otherwise 
under the line of credit  we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
the rate of interest on borrowings against the line of credit will vary depending upon the interest rate election made by us  based on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustment factor  or the prime rate 
at december   and march   we had million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit  all of which was under an interest rate swap agreement that expires in february the line of credit expires in july in october  we entered into a million term loan with our primary lender which will mature in september the interest is at a fixed rate of 
the note is unsecured and had an outstanding balance of million as of december   million of which is due in the next months 
through our subsidiaries  we have entered into lease agreements under which we lease revenue equipment 
the total amount outstanding under these agreements as of december   was million  with interest rates from to  and with million due in the next months 
management believes we have adequate liquidity to meet our current needs 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations frequently show a seasonal pattern 
seasonal variations may result from weather or from customer s reduced shipments after the busy winter holiday season 
to date  our revenue has not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
because we operate primarily in arizona  california and the western united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected our business 
expansion of our operations in the midwest  rocky mountain area  east coast  and the southeast could expose us to greater operating variances due to seasonal weather in these regions 
recent shortages of energy and related issues in california  and elsewhere in the western united states  could result in an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services should these shortages continue or increase 
this risk may exist in other regions in which we operate  depending upon availability of energy 
selected quarterly financial data the following tables set forth certain unaudited information about our revenue and results of operations on a quarterly basis for and in thousands  except per share data mar june sept dec revenue  before fuel surcharge     income from operations     net income     earnings per common share basic diluted pro forma data unaudited mar june sept dec revenue  before fuel surcharge     income from operations     net income     earnings per common share basic diluted excludes one time  pre tax  non cash write off of  relating to an investment in terion  inc mar june sept dec revenue  before fuel surcharge     income from operations     net income     earnings per common share basic diluted recently adopted accounting pronouncements recently adopted and to be adopted accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  this statement also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that we identify reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  reassess the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
this statement is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december   to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas no 
requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of adoption and reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption 
we had  in net book value recorded for goodwill at december  the current amortization of this goodwill was  per month 
at present  we are currently assessing but have not yet determined the complete impact the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results our future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
fuel prices  insurance and claims costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of qualified drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  economic and customer business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which we have little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  insurance costs or liability claims  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  and the resale value of revenue equipment could reduce our profitability 
weakness in the general economy  including a weakness in consumer demand for goods and services  could adversely affect our customers and our growth and revenues  if customers reduce their demand for transportation services 
weakness in customer demand for our services or in the general rate environment may also restrain our ability to increase rates or obtain fuel surcharges 
it is also not possible to predict the medium or long term affects of the september   terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on customer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our growth may not continue at historic rates 
we have experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of our business in there can be no assurance that our business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
we are self insured for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision and comprehensive  and for worker s compensation up to a maximum limit of  per occurrence 
subsequent to december   we increased our self insurance levels for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision and comprehensive from  to  per occurrence 
our worker s compensation self insurance level remains at  if the number of claims for which we are self insured increases  our operating results could be adversely affected 
also  we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which we self insure 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have raised premiums which has increased our insurance and claims expense 
the terrorist attacks of september   in the united states  and subsequent events  will likely result in additional increases in our insurance expenses 
if these expenses continue to increase  and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
our growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays from manufacturers or the unavailability of independent contractors could restrict future growth 
in the past  we have acquired new tractors and trailers at favorable prices  and have entered into agreements with the manufacturers to repurchase the tractors at agreed prices 
current developments in the secondary tractor resale market have resulted in a large supply of used tractors on the market 
this has depressed the market value of used equipment to levels below the prices at which the manufacturers have agreed to repurchase the equipment 
accordingly  some manufacturers may refuse or be financially unable to keep their commitments to repurchase equipment according to their repurchase agreement terms 
we understand that tractor manufacturers have communicated to customers their intention to significantly increase new equipment prices in and eliminate or sharply reduce the price of repurchase commitments 
we are currently in discussions with one of our major tractor suppliers concerning new equipment purchase prices and repurchase commitments previously made to us and whether that supplier will honor its contractual commitments to us 
our business plan and current contract take into account new equipment price increases due to engine design requirements imposed effective october   by the environmental protection agency 
if new equipment prices were to increase otherwise  or if the price of repurchase commitments were to decrease or contractual commitments are not honored by our current suppliers  we may be required to increase our depreciation and financing costs  write down the value of used equipment  and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
if our resulting cost of revenue equipment were to increase and or the prices of used revenue equipment were to decline  our operating costs could increase  which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow  if we are unable to offset these increases through rate increases or cost savings 
fuel prices may increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are also subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
if the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slows or stagnates  or if we are unable to commit sufficient resources to our regional operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
currently  a significant portion of our business is concentrated in the arizona and california markets 
a general economic decline or a natural disaster in either of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
in addition  we have established regional operations in katy  texas  indianapolis  indiana  charlotte  north carolina  gulfport  mississippi  salt lake city  utah  and kansas city  kansas in order to serve markets in these regions 
we are planning additional regional operations for these regional operations require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
should the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slow or stagnate  the results of our operations could be adversely affected 
we may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in our western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that our regional operating strategy  as employed in the western united states  can be duplicated successfully in the other areas of the united states or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated 
difficulty in driver and independent contractor retention may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  or a downturn in customer business cycles or shipping demands  could also have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
if a shortage of drivers should occur in the future  or if we were unable to continue to attract and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package  which could adversely affect our profitability if not offset by a corresponding increase in rates 
we are highly dependent on a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a few major customers 
for the year ended december   our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top customers  approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
terion trailer tracking technology may not be available to us  which could require us to incur the cost of replacement technology  adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
we utilize terion s trailer tracking technology to assist with monitoring the majority of our trailers 
terion has filed for bankruptcy protection and is attempting a reorganization under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
if terion ceases operations or abandons that technology  we would be required to incur the cost of replacing that technology or could be forced to operate without this trailer tracking technology  which could adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
our investment in concentrek may not be successful and we may be forced to write off part or all of our investment 
we have invested million and loaned approximately million to concentrek  inc  concentrek a transportation logistics company and are comitted to loan up to an additional  on a secured basis 
we own approximately of concentrek  and the remainder is owned by members of the knight family and concentrek s management 
if concentrek s financial position does not continue to improve  and if it is unable to raise additional capital  we could be forced to write down all or part of that investment 
our stock price is volatile  which could cause our shareholders to lose a significant portion of their investment 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to certain factors  such as variations in our anticipated or actual results of operations or other companies in the transportation industry  changes in conditions affecting the economy generally  including incidents of terrorism  analyst reports  general trends in the industry  sales of common stock by insiders  as well as other factors unrelated to our operating results 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent a shareholder from being able to sell his shares at or above the price paid for them 
we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy  which could limit our growth prospects 
we may grow by acquiring other trucking companies or trucking assets 
acquisitions could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or the incurrence of additional debt 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we were to make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure our shareholders that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
two of our terminal facilities are located adjacent to superfund sites 
although we have not been named as a potentially responsible party in either case  we are potentially exposed to claims that we may have contributed to environmental contamination in the areas in which we operate 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
the us dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  rates and charges  operations  safety  and financial reporting 
we may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours in service  and ergonomics 
compliance with such regulations could substantially impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
except as described below  we have not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or tracking 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
an increase in short term interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if our debt levels increase and if the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our primary lender to better manage cash flow 
under this swap agreement a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately  management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
we have not issued corporate debt instruments 
commodity price risk we are also subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
for the fiscal year ended december   fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in in august and september  we entered into two agreements to obtain price protection to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under these agreements  we purchased  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months from october   through march  if during the months following march   the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay  for a maximum of different months as selected by the contract holder during the month period beginning after march   the difference between 
per gallon and ny mx ho average price for the minimum volume commitment 
in july  we entered into a similar agreement 
under this agreement  we are obligated to purchase  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months beginning september  through february  if during the month period commencing january through december  the price index discussed above falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay the difference between 
and the stated index 
management estimates that any potential future payment under any of these agreements would be less than the amount of our savings for reduced fuel costs 
for example  management estimates that a further reduction of in the ny mx ho average price would result in a net savings  after making a payment on this agreement  to our total fuel expenses of approximately million 
future increases in the ny mx ho average price would result in us not having to make payments under these agreements 
management s current valuation of the fuel purchase agreements indicates there was no material impact upon adoption of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position and we have valued these items at fair value by recording accrued liabilities for these in the accompanying december   financial statements
