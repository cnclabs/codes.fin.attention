overview nuance develops  markets and supports software that enables enterprises and telecommunications carriers to automate the delivery of information and services over the telephone 
we were incorporated in july and began operations in october prior to  our revenue was derived from technical consulting services 
in  we deployed the first version of our software platform and began to generate software license revenue 
today  we offer a range of software products 
to support the sale  deployment and operation of our products  we also provide a number of services that include consulting  training  maintenance updates and technical support 
we sell products to our customers both directly through our sales force and indirectly through resellers and systems integrators 
customers exceeding of total revenue are 
nortel networks who  acting as a reseller  accounted for of total revenue for  of total revenue for and of total revenue for  
fidelity  a stockholder of nuance  accounted for less than of total revenue for each of and  and of total revenue for no other customers or resellers accounted for more than of our revenue for  or we sell our products to customers in north america  south america  europe  asia and australia 
international sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue for  of our total revenue for and of our total revenue for we anticipate that markets outside the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of total future revenue 
we intend to keep our sales and marketing activities constant with respect to international licensing of our software and provisioning of our services in the foreseeable future 
international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
however  we may denominate sales in foreign currencies in the future 
acquisitions on november  in an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we acquired all the outstanding shares of speechfront inc speechfront for approximately million  including acquisition costs of approximately  the consideration included approximately  shares of the company common stock valued at million and cash of approximately million 
the purchase agreement contained additional payments  of approximately million  to be made in common stock  approximately  shares  contingent upon the continued employment of the founders of speechfront 
maximum future payments  contingent solely on continued employment of the founders  is million  approximately  shares  and is payable upon the eighteen month anniversary of the acquisition date 
the remaining million  approximately  shares  also relates to the continued employment of the founders  and is payable upon the twelve month anniversary of the acquisition date  or earlier if certain performance milestones are achieved 
the contingent payments will be accounted for as compensation expense over the term of the employment condition and not as part of the purchase price 
upon consummation of the acquisition  the company established an escrow for these contingent payments 
at the time of acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
other purchased intangible assets  including goodwill and workforce  of approximately million are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of thirty six and eighteen months  respectively 
during  we entered into an agreement with a third party that gives us non exclusive intellectual property rights to text to speech software code 
we paid million for this purchased technology which has been capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the technology has alternative use and will be amortized over its useful life estimated to be five years 
we are in the process of incorporating the text to speech technology into our platform 
during the development stage  this technology is being amortized to research and development expense  and when the product is generally available for sale  which is expected to be in the first quarter of  the technology will be amortized to cost of sales 
the agreement includes a royalty clause in which we will pay of all net revenue attributable to sublicenses of this technology to a third party 
the term of the royalty payments is eight years 
as a part of our business strategy  we may in the future make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  complementary companies  products or technologies 
any future acquisitions would be accompanied by risks such as difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  diversion of our management s attention from ongoing business concerns  our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services  additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets  maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and impairment of existing relationships with employees  suppliers and customers 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our inability to do so could harm our business 
restructuring and assets impairments in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
in conjunction with the april restructuring plan  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of a sublease loss  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge of million  which represents the related leasehold improvements 
to determine the sublease loss  the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building will remain vacant sublease terms and sublease rates 
the lease loss is an estimate under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and represents the low end of the range and will be adjusted in the future upon triggering events change in estimate of time to sublease  actual sublease rates  etc we have estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be million if operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility 
in connection with the april restructuring plan  we recorded million in costs associated with severance and related benefits 
we reduced our headcount by approximately employees  with reductions ranging between and across all functional areas and affecting several locations 
we expect to save an estimated million annually of salary and related benefits as a result of this reduction in headcount 
in addition  the real estate restructuring plan is expected to lower facilities expenses  which would have been incurred had we occupied the new leased facility 
in january  we announced a restructuring plan that would reduce our workforce by approximately 
these charges are being recorded primarily to realign the sales organization  to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization see note 
we may  however  be required to expand our business operations in the future  and as a result may need to expand our management  operational  financial and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
during the year  we recorded million related to purchased text to speech technology 
for the period ending december   we amortized million to research and development as the product was being developed into nuance s text to speech product offering 
during the quarter ending december   we reviewed the current value of these intangible assets based on an analysis which considered existing business conditions and economic declines including the overall declines in industry growth rates that have negatively impacted expected future revenue 
based on consideration of these factors  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of this asset using undiscounted cash flows 
this analysis indicated that the asset was impaired  accordingly  such asset was written down by million to estimated fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
during the year ending december   we purchased  of third party software to complement our core platform product line 
at year end  we evaluated this third party software and wrote off  of excess inventory caused by lower than expected demand 
we will continue to assess the remaining carrying value of the inventory in relation to recovery of future revenues 
in connection with our speechfront acquisition in november  we allocated purchase price to goodwill and workforce of million 
during the quarter ending december   we reviewed the existing business conditions and determined that the voice instant messaging system technologies under development during will not be utilized by the company 
as a result  we decided to cease the development of instant messaging system technologies and impair the remaining asset balance as of december   which has resulted in a charge of million relating to the impairment of speechfront intangibles  which represented the remaining balances at december  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition  
estimating valuation allowances and lease loss  
accounting for income taxes  and 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition our license revenue consists of license fees for our software products 
the license fees for our software products are calculated using two variables  one of which is the estimated maximum number of simultaneous end user connections to an application running on our software and the other of which is the value attributed to the functional use of the software 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and sales of hardware where the software is not incidental 
all revenues generated from our worldwide operations are approved at our corporate headquarters  located in the united states 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we use a signed contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for licenses and maintenance renewals 
for services  we use a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
software is delivered to customers either electronically or on a cd rom 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
we recognize license revenue either upon issuance of the permanent software license key or on system acceptance  if the customer has established acceptance criteria which occurs only in a small minority of cases 
in those contracts having acceptance criteria  criteria typically consist of a demonstration to the customer that  upon implementation  the software performs in accordance with specified system parameters  such as recognition accuracy or call completion rates 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery occurs 
license revenue from value added resellers and oems is recognized when product has been sold through to an end user and such sell through has been reported to the company 
the timing of license revenue recognition is affected by whether we perform consulting services in the arrangement and the nature of those services 
in the majority of cases  we either perform no consulting services or we perform standard implementation services that are not essential to the functionality of the software 
when we perform consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize both license and consulting revenue utilizing contract accounting based on the percentage of the consulting services that have been completed 
service revenue consists of revenue from providing consulting and training 
our consulting service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
training service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
losses on services contracts  if any  are recognized as soon as such losses become known 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software upgrades and enhancements 
we recognize all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
customers renew maintenance agreements annually 
our standard payment terms are net to days from the date of invoice 
thus  a significant portion of our accounts receivable balance at the end of a quarter is primarily comprised of revenue from that quarter 
we record deferred revenue primarily as a result of payments from customers received in advance of recognition of revenue 
as of december   deferred revenue was million 
the deferred revenue amount includes unearned license  prepaid maintenance and professional services that will be recognized as revenue in the future as we deliver licenses and perform services 
estimating valuation allowance for doubtful accounts and lease loss we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on a percentage of our accounts receivable  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we restructured our business and have established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost as required by accounting standards against outstanding commitments for leased property that we have not occupied 
these reserves are based upon management s estimate of the time required to sublet the property and the amount of sublet income that might be generated between the date the property was not occupied and expiration of the lease for each of the unoccupied property 
these estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial increase or decrease to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we periodically assess the realizability of long lived assets  including intangibles in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we also periodically assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a write down of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future 
for the year ending december   we recorded two impairments on intangible assets see note 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective 
this will not have an impact on our financial statements as all goodwill has been amortized or impaired 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the exercise of management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k and which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of license revenue consists primarily of fees payable on third party software products and documentation  media costs and inventory writedowns 
cost of service revenue consists of compensation and related overhead costs for employees engaged in consulting  training and maintenance for our customers 
our operating expenses are classified into seven general categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  in process research and development  amortization of intangibles  restructuring charge and asset impairments and non cash compensation 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to the category  some expenditures  such as compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  facilities costs and third party professional services fees  occur in each of these categories  except for non cash compensation and restructuring charge and asset impairments 
we allocate the total costs for information services and facilities to each functional area that uses information services and facilities based on relative headcount 
these allocated costs include rent and other facility related costs for our offices  communication charges and depreciation expense for property and equipment  computer hardware and software maintenance 
we had full time employees as of december  in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
additionally  in conjunction with the january restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by another primarily to realign the sales organization  to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
we may  however  be required to increase our workforce as business grows in the future  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion may place significant demands on our management and operational resources 
from our inception through december   we have incurred approximately million of operating costs and expenses  including approximately million of research and development expenditures used to develop our current and future software products 
costs incurred in the research and development of software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
once established  these costs would be capitalized 
amounts that could have been capitalized were insignificant and  therefore  no costs have been capitalized to date 
as a result of these and other operating expenditures  we have incurred net operating losses in each year since inception 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we build our sales and marketing organizations and as we continue to invest in research and development 
accordingly  we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly changing markets 
we have experienced both significant revenue growth and revenue decline in the past 
furthermore  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future

service and maintenance revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to service revenue represented of total revenue for  of total revenue for and of total revenue for the increase in service revenue in absolute dollars from to was due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred service revenue as well as growth in professional services headcount  which enabled completion of more professional service projects 
service revenue growth has slowed partially due to the decline in license revenue as well as the reduction in customers project implementations in light of general economic conditions 
the increase of service revenue in absolute dollars from to was due to growth in license revenue and revenue for certain non recurring engineering work performed in the second and third quarters of cost of revenue cost of license revenue consists primarily of fees payable on third party software products and documentation  media costs and inventory writedowns 
cost of license revenues were  in and  for and for during the year  we purchased  of third party software to complement our core platform product line 
at year end  we evaluated the third party software and wrote off  of excess inventory caused by lower than expected demand 
we will continue to assess the remaining carrying value of the inventory in relation to recovery of future revenues 
we anticipate that cost of license revenue will increase moderately in absolute dollars  in part due to royalty payments in relation to our new vocalizer product as well as recording the inventory costs for third party software product when the product is sold 
cost of service revenue consists of compensation and related overhead costs for employees engaged in consulting  training and maintenance for our customers 
cost of service revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to cost of service and maintenance revenue as a percentage of service revenue was for  for and for the increase in cost of revenues from to  as well as the decrease in the service margin percentages  was primarily due to hiring additional personnel in the professional services  technical support and training groups and a decline in professional services utilization rates 
cost of maintenance revenue increased year to year due to increase of customer base 
although the number of headcount for professional services  technical support and training groups personnel decreased from year end to year end as a result of the restructuring plan  payroll and related expenses increased due to the acceleration of our hiring of personnel in the beginning of the year 
the increase in cost of revenues from to was due to hiring additional employees  many in the fourth quarter of  in the professional services  technical support and training groups and utilization of outside organizations 
we anticipate that cost of service and maintenance revenue will decrease in absolute dollars  in connection with the first quarter restructuring plan  although cost of service and maintenance revenue will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our service operations in the future and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls to support any such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with professional services  technical support and training groups 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing employees and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and bad debt 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was attributable to the addition of sales and marketing personnel  which added approximately million in payroll and related expenses  and increases in travel and related expenses of approximately million 
although the number of headcount for sales and marketing personnel decreased from year end to year end as a result of the restructuring plan  payroll and related expenses increased due to the acceleration of our hiring personnel in the beginning of the year 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions expense of million  resulting from the relative decrease in revenue  and a reduction in bad debt expense of  the increase in sales and marketing expense from to was attributable to the addition of sales and marketing employees  which added approximately million in payroll and related expenses and million in commission and bonus expense 
travel and related costs also increased by million and recruiting costs increased by  higher marketing costs due to expanded promotional activities added approximately  in expenses  while bad debt expense increased by million 
as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses were in  in and in we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our sales and marketing operations in the future  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with sales and marketing

research and development expenses consist of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the decrease in research and development expenses from to was attributable to the reduction of research and development personnel  which resulted in approximately  reduction in payroll related and travel expenses 
additionally  the use of external consultants was reduced by approximately  the increase in research and development expenses from to was attributable to the addition of approximately employees  which added approximately million in expenses and the cost of technical contractors  which added approximately million in expenses 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in  in and in we anticipate that research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our research and development operations in the future  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with research and development

general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related costs for administrative employees  legal services  accounting services and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was largely due to the addition of administrative employees  which added approximately million in payroll related expenses and increased legal and professional fees of approximately million 
the additional expenses enhanced our administrative infrastructure to strengthen controls and accommodate growth 
although the number of headcount for general and administrative functions decreased during the year as a result of the restructuring plan  payroll and related expenses increased due to the acceleration of our hiring personnel in the beginning of the year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was attributable to the addition of approximately administrative employees  which added approximately million in expenses and approximately  in recruiting costs 
increased legal and professional fees added approximately  in expense while increased insurance costs  primarily consisting of directors and officers insurance  also increased by  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and will vary as a percentage of total revenue from period to period 
we may  however  be required to expand our general and administrative operations in the future  and as a result may need to expand our operational and human resources  as well as information systems and controls  to support any such growth 
such expansion would likely increase expenses associated with general and administrative functions 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of speechfront  inc speechfront on november   nuance allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
at december   we reviewed the current value of the recorded assets relating to the speechfront acquisition based on existing business conditions and determined that the voice instant messaging system technologies under development during the year were not aligned with the company s revised strategy and will not be utilized 
as a result  we impaired the intangible assets and recorded a charge of million see note 
amortization of intangibles 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets of million were recorded in connection with the acquisition of speechfront in november amortization of intangibles were million in and  for there was no amortization of intangibles for the year ended december  non cash compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million within stockholders equity  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and will be amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and  in the years ending december   and  respectively  relating to approximately  stock options granted at a weighted average exercise price of 
for the year ending december   we reversed approximately  of deferred stock compensation and additional paid in capital  which represented unamortized deferred stock compensation relating to employees terminated under the restructuring plan 
in connection with our speechfront acquisition  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
of that amount  million relates to retention of the founders of speechfront  and  is payable upon the eighteen month anniversary of the acquisition date  which is may the remaining million also relates to retention of the founders and is payable upon the twelve month anniversary of the acquisition date  which is november  or earlier if certain performance milestones are achieved 
these amounts are being amortized over months and months  respectively 
upon consummation of the acquisition  we established an escrow account for these contingent payments 
as of december   million was released from the escrow account 
approximately million and  were amortized in and related to these deferred compensation amounts 
in december  we issued to a customer a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
the warrant is exercisable at the option of the holder  in whole or part  at any time between january  and august in january  we valued the warrant at  utilizing the black scholes valuation model using the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yields of zero  expected life of years and expected volatility of 
the warrant is being amortized over months to compensation expense 
we amortized  related to this warrant in the year ended december  during the year  we performed services of  for this customer and reduced the warrant expense for the period by this amount 
in july  an employee was terminated effective september the employee was allowed to continue to vest in his stock options which resulted in a pre tax non cash compensation charge of  in accordance with the fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
we expect to amortize million and  and  of non cash compensation in  and  respectively 
restructuring charges and assets impairments 
in april  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan that would align our expenses with revised anticipated demand and create a more efficient organization 
for the year ending december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million for our lease loss and severance costs  and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements 
in conjunction with the restructuring plan  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of a sublease loss  broker commissions and other facility costs 
to determine the sublease loss  the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing the building  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building will remain vacant sublease terms and sublease rates 
the lease loss is an estimate under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and represents the low end of the range and will be adjusted in the future upon triggering events such as a change in estimate of time to sublease and actual sublease rates 
we have estimated that the lease loss could be as much as million if operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility 
in connection with the april restructuring plan  we recorded million in costs associated with severance and related benefits 
we reduced our headcount by approximately employees  with reductions ranging between and across all functional areas and affecting several locations 
we expect to save an estimated million annually of salary and related benefits as a result of this reduction in headcount 
in addition  the real estate restructuring plan is expected to lower facilities expenses which would have been incurred had we occupied the new leased facility 
the restructuring charges for the year ending december  are as follows in millions severance and related total lease loss benefits restructuring total charge in the year ending december  amount utilized for the year ending december  accrual balance at december  total cash outlay for the restructuring plan is expected to be million  of which million was paid through december  and the million remain accrued at december  we expect million of the lease loss to be paid out over the next twelve months and the remaining million to be paid out over the remaining life of the lease of approximately years 
we expect the remaining  of employee severance and related benefits accrual to be paid out by march  in january  we announced a restructuring plan that would reduce our workforce by approximately 
these charges are being recorded primarily to realign the sales organization  to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization see note 
for the quarter ending june   we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to leasehold improvement 
included in the million asset impairment charge was approximately  for leasehold improvements under construction 
during the quarter ended december   we decreased the estimate by approximately  for the year ending december   we recorded a million charge related to impairments of intangible assets in accordance with the accounting principles under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
interest and other income  net  was million in  million in and  in representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to these increases were due to higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances  primarily the result of cash proceeds raised in our initial public offering in april and our follow on offering in september provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december  and therefore have not recorded a provision for domestic federal income taxes for any period through december  we recorded income tax expense relating to foreign taxes for the periods ended december  and of  and  respectively 
a valuation allowance of million is required for the total domestic deferred tax asset for the period ended december  based upon our limited operating history  our lack of profitability to date  and the uncertainty of future profitability at that time 
management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax benefit of  from deferred tax assets related to foreign taxes 
our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes has been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
a portion of our valuation allowance relates to the equity benefit of our net operating losses 
we had approximately million  million and  of taxable dispositions of employee stock options for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a portion of the valuation allowance  when reduced  will be credited directly to stockholders equity 
these benefits amounted to million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in management s opinion  have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document and include all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and associated notes

as a result  they should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and investments totaling approximately million 
in april  we raised approximately million through the completion of our initial public offering of common stock 
in october  we completed a follow on offering of common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of million 
from inception through march   we financed our operations primarily from private sales of convertible preferred stock totaling million and  to a lesser extent  from bank financing 
our operating activities used cash of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the negative operating cash flow in resulted principally from our net losses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in the restructuring accrual and the asset impairments 
the negative operating cash flow in resulted principally from our net losses and increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets 
these factors were partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities  deferred revenue and non cash compensation and other expenses 
the negative operating cash flow in resulted principally from our net losses as we invested in the development of our products  expanded our sales force and expanded our infrastructure to support our growth 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million during  and  respectively

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
we may continue to report significant quarterly operating losses resulting in future negative operating cash flows 
we do not plan to spend more than million on capital expenditures in the next months 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our short term and long term investments  and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  including increases in employees and office facilities  to develop new or enhance existing products or services  to respond to competitive pressures  or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may  from time to time  evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and technologies 
we may also consider additional equity or debt financing  which could be dilutive to existing investors

revenues generated from this customer were approximately   and million for the years ending december   and certain members of our board of directors also serve as directors for companies to which we sell products in the ordinary course of our business 
we believe that the terms of our transactions with those companies are no less favorable to us than the terms that would have been obtained absent those relationships

recently issued accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb approved for issuance sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
major provisions of these statements are as follows all business combinations initiated after june  must use the purchase method of accounting  the pooling of interest method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated before july   intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually using a fair value approach  except in certain circumstances  and whenever there is an impairment indicator  other intangible assets will continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives  in process research and development will continue to be written off immediately  all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting  effective january   existing goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization 
goodwill acquired subsequent to june  will not be subject to amortization 
because we did not initiate any business combinations after june   the adoption of sfas no 
does not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
is effective beginning in the first quarter of with the exception of goodwill and intangibles assets acquired after june   which will be subject immediately to the non amortization and amortization provisions 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
whereby an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
eliminates goodwill from its scope  therefore it does not require goodwill to be allocated to long lived assets 
sfas no 
broadens the scope of apb provisions for the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently assessing the provisions of this statement to determine their impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
speechfront intangible assets amortization for the year ended december  was approximately million 
for the year ended december   we performed an impairment analysis of identifiable assets and goodwill and we recorded a charge of million to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   we have approximately million remaining in intangible assets and no goodwill recorded in our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued an announcement on the topic of income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred the announcement 
the announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations 
we have netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the announcement is to be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods are to be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
management is currently assessing the provisions of this announcement to determine its impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in july  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  eitf generally requires that the consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be classified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as an offset of revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf clarifies and modifies certain items discussed in eitf the company is required to adopt these new standards no later than the quarter ending march   and comparative financial statements are required to be reclassified to comply with the new pronouncement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk to date  all of our recognized revenues have been denominated in us dollars and primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that future product license and services revenues derived from international markets may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of million 
any decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term and long term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  a decrease in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately  the following table summarizes the types and maturities of our investments for december  in thousands maturity maturity in less than maturity maturity excess of total fair source of fair value year years years years value us treasury notes   us government agency bonds    corporate bonds    commercial paper   total
