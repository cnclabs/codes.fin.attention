item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this research led to the development of a proprietary second generation implanter  the ibis  which we began selling in  and to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  there was a shift in revenue to sales of simox soi wafers for commercial applications and sales of ibis implanters 
in  substantially all of our wafer sales were for commercial applications and four of our customers utilized our simox soi wafers in their products 
many more of our customers are sampling simox soi wafers or are developing prototype products 
to date  most of our customers have purchased wafers for the purpose of characterizing and evaluating the wafers  developing prototype products or for pilot production 
thus  historical sales are not necessarily indicative of future operations because such sales would not be considered of a recurring nature 
in  ibis began selling its ibis implanters to semiconductor manufacturers and in we experienced a significant increase in this area of our business 
however  during  ibis experienced a shift from demand for implanters to demand for simox soi wafers 
this trend is expected to continue in the near term as our customers continue to sample soi and the early adopters work to achieve stable production processes and enter pilot production 
for the fiscal years ending december  and december   ibis recognized revenue on the sale of implanters using the percentage of completion method and upon delivery  respectively 
ibis has experienced quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to the timing of receipt of equipment orders and dependence on a limited number of customers 
we may continue to experience fluctuations in revenue due to equipment sales and shifts in customer demands during various stages of the simox soi sales cycle 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately four of our ibis oxygen implanters were used to generate simox soi wafer sales and three implanters were used for non revenue generating activities  such as research and development 
ibis currently has ten ibis oxygen implanters  including those customer owned 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  product sales 
wafer product sales increased to  for the fiscal year ended december   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in product sales is attributable to increased wafer sales by ibis in europe  primarily from one customer who is using ibis simox soi wafers in its commercial products

liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of  reflecting in large part our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the august public sale of  shares of common stock

this accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
due to the capital intensive nature of ibis business and the anticipated expansion of its facilities and production capacity  management expects that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a significant portion of its expenses 
to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt and equity financings 
the principal use of cash during the fiscal year ended december  was to fund additions to property and equipment which totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had invested  in property and equipment 
at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately  in material or subassemblies to be used for manufacturing ibis implanters and approximately  in capital equipment purchases 
on august   ibis completed the public offering of  shares of common stock in an offering underwritten by soundview technology group 
the shares were included in a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  and declared effective on july  net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and ibis intends to use the proceeds to fund research and development  capital expenditures  working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that we may be required to raise substantial additional capital in the future in order to finance further expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our research and development programs 
our existing cash resources together with funds generated from operations are believed to be sufficient to support ibis operations on our anticipated scale for at least the next eighteen months 
management of ibis currently believes that this anticipated scale of operations will include the addition of ibis oxygen implanters  the purchase of support equipment  the expansion of ibis facilities and the design and development of the next generation oxygen implanter  the ibis additional implanters are expected to be transferred to production at various times as additional capacity is needed to meet demand 
effects of inflation ibis believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas that establishes accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposures to changes in fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  unrecognized firm commitments  an available for sale security or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in fair value under sfas depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in june  the fasb decided that the effective date for adopting the requirements of sfas should be delayed to fiscal years beginning after june  this delay  published as sfas  applies to quarterly and annual financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  which addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for numerous entities that apply sfas ibis does not expect this to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin  as amended  established guidelines for revenue recognition and was originally effective for periods beginning after march  in june  the sec announced that the effective date of sab was being delayed until no later than the quarter ending december  ibis does not expect this to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations as ibis has complied with sab in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this interpretation clarified the application of opinion  among other issues a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a stock ownership plan qualifies as noncompensatory  c the accounting implications of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for the exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
the interpretation is effective july  and the effects of applying the interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the exposure of market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments is not material to ibis  as we do not transact our sales denominated in other than united states dollars  invest primarily in short term commercial paper  hold our investments until maturity and have not entered into hedging transactions
