special considerations the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will continue to provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to remain profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
shortages of fuel or increases in fuel prices could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
many of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel the company recognized million of fuel surcharge revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in 
additionally  at times  fuel purchase contracts are used to mitigate the effects of increases in the prices of fuel 
during the latter part of  fuel prices steadily increased  and they remained at significantly higher levels in competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense  and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sales of used revenue equipment  and the use of long term operating leases for revenue equipment acquisitions 
on december   the company had in place a million credit facility with a group of banks with a weighted average interest rate of  of which million was available for borrowing 
the line of credit was amended in january under the terms of the amended agreement  the facility will be reduced to million on june  the loan matures january  interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon the london interbank offered rate plus applicable margins  as defined in the credit agreement 
the note is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
in september the company entered into a long term loan agreement for million to finance the new colton  california terminal facility 
the term of the loan is years  with amortization based on years  and carries a variable interest rate that is based on the day commercial paper rate  plus a margin 
this rate can be converted to a fixed rate at any time up to september in  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sale of used revenue equipment and long term operating lease financing for the acquisition of revenue equipment 
cash generated from operations increased to million in from million in net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment  and in  for the acquisition and construction of the new colton  california terminal facility 
during  the company made a million cash investment to acquire a equity interest in transplace 
in  million was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to million for proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were million in  compared to million in net cash used in financing activities was million in and million in borrowings under the line of credit were reduced by million in and million in as authorized by the company s board of directors   shares of the company s class a common stock were repurchased in for million  and  shares were repurchased in for million 
management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit and long term operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  shipments generally show a seasonal pattern as customers increase shipments prior to and reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
additionally  shipments can be adversely impacted by winter weather conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
as amended by sfas no 
 sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas effective january  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
however  it could increase the volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income for future periods 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s line of credit which has variable interest rates 
at december  the company had million of variable rate debt 
the company has interest rate swap agreements which convert floating rates to fixed rates for a total notional amount of million 
if interest rates on the company s variable rate debt  after considering interest rate swaps  were to increase by from their december  rates for the next twelve months  the increase in interest expense would be approximately million 
commodity price risk fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside the company s control 
many of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel 
however  there is no assurance that such fuel surcharges could be used to offset future increases in fuel prices
