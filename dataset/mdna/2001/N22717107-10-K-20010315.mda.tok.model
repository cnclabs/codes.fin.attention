item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of we have based the forward looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations  estimates and projections 
we caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that we cannot predict 
in addition  we have based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate 
accordingly  our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements 
our operations are subject to various risk factors including  but not limited to o our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology 
o the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions 
o our dependence on the oil and gas industry  and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our customers 
o competition in our markets 
o the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry  political  economic and financial market conditions  including stock prices  government regulations  interest rates and credit availability 
oil and gas prices rebounded strongly in from the lows experienced in this recovery continued throughout capital spending for exploration and production for many of our customers is influenced by expectations of the supply and demand and prices of oil and gas 
with higher oil and gas prices  our customers often increase their capital budgets which will generally increase the level of spending for our products and services 
however  while our revenues increased year over year  this increase was not proportional to the increased activity levels expected from the higher oil and gas prices 
also  as a result of the consolidation in the oil and gas industry  some of our customers have used and may continue to use their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
business core laboratories was established in and is currently traded on the new york stock exchange 
we provide our products and services to the world s major  national and independent oil companies 
our specialty services and products are designed to improve oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields through the following business segments o reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock  fluid and gas samples 
we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry 
o production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions  perforations  stimulations and production 
we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects 
o reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs 
we plan to continue the expansion of our operations through i continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client driven research and development  ii expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and iii acquiring complementary businesses that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing products and services 
we continued to demonstrate success with our acquisition strategy  as illustrated by our most recent acquisitions of tomoseis  pencor and cpi 
we have also pursued the sale of assets not critical to our growth strategy by divesting ourselves of substantially all of our environmental testing assets in in addition  we believe that we have positioned ourselves for increased profitability by consolidating redundant facilities and reducing excess personnel 
results of operations revenues and income from continuing operations dollars in millions 
chart 
service revenues in were million  which compares to million in  and million in this excludes revenues of million and million in and  respectively  attributable to our environmental testing assets  which were disposed of in the third quarter of the increase in service revenues in indicates a recovery from the depressed market conditions in and these increases were primarily derived from an increase in activity levels in north america for our development and production enhancement projects 
costs of services in were million  a decrease of million as compared to and a decrease of million as compared to costs of services expressed as a percentage of service revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
during  we took actions to reduce our cost structure  including personnel reductions and office consolidations  which contributed to an improvement in our service margins 
sales revenues in were million  which compares to million in  and million in  an increase of and  respectively 
this increase was primarily driven by increased spending by our customers on the advanced technologies provided by owen oil tools owen  which provides well completion and stimulation technologies 
costs of sales in were million  an increase of million and million as compared to and  respectively 
costs of sales expressed as a percentage of sales revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales in and as compared to was primarily due to the costs associated with the and increase in related sales during these time periods 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of corporate management and centralized administrative services which benefit our operating subsidiaries 
although general and administrative expenses are generally more fixed in nature  we did experience an increase which was largely attributable to training and conversion costs for an upgraded accounting system and growth in the number of people necessary to support increases in the scope of our operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was million in as compared to  which reflected an increase of million as compared to general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained below for all periods 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased slightly as compared to and although we had million of capital expenditures in  the additional depreciation expense from these assets was more than offset by the effect of asset retirements  the sale of the assets of our environmental testing operations and the effect of assets which had become fully depreciated 
amortization of goodwill in and was million in each year  an increase from the million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of goodwill attributable to acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
in the first quarter of  we recorded write offs and other charges totaling million 
this amount included million of asset write offs  million related to facility closures and personnel reductions  and million associated with the termination of the proposed acquisition of geoscience corp 
the asset write offs consisted primarily of uncollectible accounts receivable in the former soviet union and other eastern hemisphere locations  due to economic instability in the region  as well as adjustments to net realizable value of certain inventory and other current asset amounts 
the facility closures consisted primarily of the shutdown of our environmental testing laboratory in edison  new jersey  the saybolt western hemisphere administrative office and a substantial reduction in our venezuelan work force 
these actions  which affected a total of employees  were substantially complete as of april  the termination settlement included the forgiveness of million in working capital advances made by core laboratories to geoscience corp 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to cover the cost of exiting redundant facilities and restructuring certain of our operations 
this charge affected each of our operating segments as follows reservoir description million  production enhancement million  reservoir management million 
we combined personnel and equipment from eight facilities into one houston facility but no operations were discontinued and we do not expect this facility consolidation to negatively affect our future revenues 
the move was completed in the second quarter of related charges included severance for approximately field and administrative employees  the accrual of future lease obligations and facility restoration costs and the write off of redundant fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
substantially all of these employees were terminated as of june  cash required for the costs incurred through december  of million  excluding asset write offs  was funded from operating activities 
we anticipate that the remaining costs will also be funded through cash from operating activities 
this charge is summarized in the following table restructuring charges dollars in thousands asset lease write obligations severance restoration offs a other total total restructuring charges    less costs incurred through december    accrual remaining at december  
  less costs incurred through december    accrual remaining   a the fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to the houston consolidation were disposed of by the end of june the write off approximates the carrying amount as these assets were abandoned or sold for salvage value 
depreciation expense was reduced by approximately in  and will be reduced by in and thereafter 
also included in this amount were of working capital write offs related to the restructuring of foreign operations 
the asset write offs attributable to each segment were as follows reservoir description  production enhancement  reservoir management as discussed above  our results of operations in were adversely affected by lower activity and spending levels in the industry 
the actions we took in  including those which resulted in the restructuring charges  were intended to lower our fixed operating costs and provide other operating benefits  including improved communications and customer service 
we did not change our restructuring plan or revise our original estimates after the initial charge was recognized 
interest expense for was million  a decrease of approximately million as compared to  after increasing million compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to the reduction of debt during the year 
the increase from was due in part to additional borrowings and debt assumed in connection with acquisitions  together with an increase in interest rates  both from rising market interest rates and higher rates associated with the senior notes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate to in from in and in reflects the increase in international earnings taxed at rates lower than the netherlands statutory rate 
in  we sold the majority of the net assets of our packaged analyzer business line for approximately million in cash  resulting in a loss on sale of million 
goodwill specifically related to this business line of approximately million was also written off  as was million of work in process inventory which was subsequently abandoned 
these amounts are included in the loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
the losses from this business line of million in have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
segment analysis our operations are managed primarily in three complementary segments 
segment information revenues for the years ended december  dollars in thousands reservoir description    production enhancement    reservoir management    total revenues    income loss before interest  taxes and unusual charges for the years ended december  a dollars in thousands reservoir description    production enhancement    reservoir management    corporate and other income before interest  taxes and unusual charges    a the above segment amounts exclude unusual charges totaling  in the unusual charges  which are comprised of write offs  restructuring charges and other charges in the first quarter and fourth quarter of  were allocated to each segment as follows reservoir description  production enhancement  reservoir management  and corporate and other  which consists of costs related to the termination of the proposed geoscience acquisition reservoir description reservoir description revenues for were million  an increase of compared to revenues and compared to revenues after excluding the revenues attributable to our environmental testing assets  which were sold in when revenues attributable to our environmental testing assets are included in and  this segment s revenues decreased by and  respectively 
income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in increased million as compared to and decreased million as compared to our margins in this segment came under pressure in as our clients reduced spending in response to lower oil and gas prices 
production enhancement production enhancement revenues for were million  an increase of compared to revenues and compared to revenues 
income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in was million  which was an increase of and as compared to and  respectively 
the increases in revenues and income result primarily from increased demand for well completion and stimulation technologies provided by protechnics and owen 
reservoir management reservoir management revenues for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues and compared to revenues 
due to the decline in revenues and lower margins  we experienced a loss of million in this segment in  versus a loss of million in and earnings of million in of all our operations  this segment was affected to the greatest extent by the industry downturn in and virtually flat international spending by our clients in demand for our seismic related services was weak throughout and across most regions 
part of this loss can be attributed to expenditures we made for research and development and marketing of new reservoir optimization technologies 
we have taken and will continue to take actions  when appropriate  to control our costs and generate additional service revenues in order to improve our results in this segment 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our activities through cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities  equity financing and the issuance of debt 
during the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were million  an increase of million and million from the corresponding periods in and  respectively 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at december  and million at december  we are a netherlands holding company and we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
consequently  our cash flow is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us 
our financing activities provided million in  an increase of million compared to and million compared to our investing activities used million in after having provided million in and using million in the significant financing and investing activities in were as follows o during the second quarter of we completed a public offering in which certain shareholders sold  of their common shares 
in connection with the offering  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option and purchased  common shares from us which resulted in net proceeds of million 
these funds were used principally to reduce indebtedness and fund capital expenditures 
o indebtedness and capital leases were reduced by a total of million 
o we incurred capital expenditures from continuing operations of million which included cash outlays for the facility consolidation in houston 
our ability to maintain and grow our operating income and cash flow is dependent upon continued capital spending 
we believe our future cash flow from operations  supplemented by our borrowing capacity and issuances of additional equity should be sufficient to fund debt requirements  capital expenditures  working capital and future acquisitions 
due to the low inflationary rates in  and  the impact of inflation on our results of operations was insignificant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we do not enter  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to market risks  which are primarily related to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  are material 
during  we issued fixed rate senior notes denominated in us dollars 
the proceeds were used to pay off variable rate term loans 
this significantly reduced our exposure to market risk 
this section should be read in conjunction with note long term debt and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements
