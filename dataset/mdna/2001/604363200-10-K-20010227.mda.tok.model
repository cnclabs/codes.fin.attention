item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company develops and implements mobile communications solutions  including integrated voice  data and position location services 
the initial application for the company s wireless enhanced services has been developed for  and is marketed and sold to  companies that operate in the long haul trucking market 
the company provides long haul trucking companies with a comprehensive package of mobile communications and management information services  thereby enabling its trucking customers to effectively monitor the operations and improve the performance of their fleets 
the initial product application was customized and has been sold to and installed in the service vehicle fleets of the member companies of sbc communications  inc  pursuant to the service vehicle contract the service vehicle contract or contract 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered the mobile asset tracking market with the introduction of its trailer tracking product  trackware 
trackware is currently being tested by prospective customers 
there were no significant revenues from trackware during the company earns revenues from service contracts and from related products sold to customers for which title generally passes on shipment 
in accordance with previously existing generally accepted accounting principles  the company generally recognized revenues from product sales and licensing of product software at the time the mobile units were shipped to customers 
during  as a result of new interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles by the securities and exchange commission the sec  through issuance of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab the company was required to change its accounting policy for product revenue recognition 
the company sells mobile communications systems and related enhanced mobile communications and management information services that are provided though the company s proprietary network 
with respect to the series mobile units sold to the company s long haul trucking customers  these units function only when used in conjunction with the company s proprietary network 
accordingly  in accordance with these new interpretations  the company has changed its product revenue recognition policy for sales to long haul trucking customers  to defer product revenue previously recognized upon shipment and instead recognize such revenue ratably over the longer of the term of the service contract or the estimated life of the customer relationship 
such terms range from three to ten years 
the product costs associated with these revenues are also deferred and amortized over such period 
the product revenues and related costs are portrayed in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as ratable product revenues and ratable product costs  respectively 
product revenues from sales of mobile units pursuant to the service vehicle contract  are recognized currently  after a brief acceptance period  because these mobile units have different functionality that permit their use on other than the company s proprietary network 
as a result of the change in accounting principle described above  for which restatement of prior years is not permitted  the company s revenues and cost of revenues are not directly comparable to prior years 
during the third quarter of the company announced that it was i halting the development of its autolink r service  and ii implementing a number of key management and structural changes designed to more closely align the company s expenditures with its revenues 
as a result of these announcements  the company reduced its workforce by approximately and recorded charges of  for obligations under employment contracts and severance payments to terminated employees  and  to recognize asset impairments and record estimated amounts to be incurred to extinguish contractual obligations associated with the autolink r program 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues increased to million in from million in comparison of product revenues year over year is not meaningful because of the accounting principle change discussed under general above 
product revenues in include only service vehicle contract revenues while includes all revenues from the sale of mobile units 
ratable product revenue in reflects the current year recognition of revenues from units shipped in prior years 
in accordance with the new accounting principle for product revenue mandated in  such revenues are deferred upon product shipment and recognized ratably over the greater of the term of the service agreement or the estimated life of the customer relationship 
service revenues decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to lower average monthly revenue per mobile unit 
while the average installed base of mobile units increased from to  the average monthly revenue per mobile unit decreased to in from in  primarily due to the increasing proportion of service vehicles in the installed base and reduced personal calling revenue 
average revenue for service vehicles is significantly less than that of long haul trucking because of different product functionality 
the installed base of mobile units increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase in the installed base reflects additional units installed under the service vehicle contract more than offsetting a reduction in the installed base for long haul trucking 
the reduction in the installed base for long haul trucking is primarily due to one customer  with an aggregate installed base of approximately  units  that was deinstalled due to its inability to pay amounts owed to the company 
service gross profit margin was in compared to in as more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  during the company recorded million of credits due from cellular carriers related to prior years 
excluding the effect of these credits  the service gross profit margin would have been 
the decrease in service gross profit margin from in to in is primarily the result of i the significant increase during of post sale support and maintenance activity and ii the negative impact in of a temporary increase in long distance airtime rates during the transition period to a new contract

excluding the effect of this million charge  margin would have been 
operating expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in bad debt expense  offset by increases in sales and marketing expenses related to trackware  and increased research and development expenditures 
bad debt expense in was unusually high as a result of bad debt provisions recorded for former customers 
bad debt expense in was unusually low as a result of adjustments made to reduce the reserve for bad debts in recognition of the improved credit profile of the customer base 
interest income was million in  compared to million in  reflecting the lower average outstanding balances during in cash  short term investments  and pledged securities 
other income in primarily consists of the proceeds from the settlement of litigation  net of related expenses

year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues increased to million in from million in product revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in product revenues is a result of recognizing million of revenues on the service vehicle contract entered into during that required delivery of mobile units coupled with development and delivery of additional features over the term of the installation period 
service revenues increased to million in from million in due to the increased installed base of mobile units 
the average installed base of mobile units during increased from the average installed base

liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred significant operating losses since inception and has a stockholders deficit of approximately million at december  beginning march   the company is obligated to begin paying substantial semi annual cash interest payments on its senior notes which were issued in september interest payments due on the senior notes through september   had previously been funded through an escrow arrangement created upon closing of the senior notes 
the company currently believes it will have the cash resources available to make the march  interest payment  but absent the pending equity and debt transactions described in note to the consolidated financial statements which are contingent upon a number of factors also described in note  the company has limited financial resources available to support its ongoing operations  fund its product development program to develop and market new competitive tracking technology  and pay its obligations as they become due  including the maturities of the senior notes and associated interest payments 
the factors noted in the above paragraph raise substantial doubt concerning the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ongoing support of its stockholders  creditors  and certain key customers  the consummation of the pending equity and debt transactions or the closing of similar debt or equity transactions  and its ability to successfully develop and market its tracking products and technology at economically feasible levels in the highly competitive and rapidly changing telecommunications industry 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has pending equity and debt transactions which the company believes  if consummated  will provide adequate financial resources to support the company until it is able to achieve a successful level of operations 
the company also believes acquisition of the licensing rights associated with the pending equity transaction will provide the company significant marketing potential of the licensed tracking technology  enhancing future results of operations and reducing the need for capital resources to develop similar tracking technology 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to close the pending debt and equity transactions or that such financial resources provided by the pending transactions  if closed  will be sufficient to support the company until it reaches a successful level of operations 
there is also no assurance that the company would be able to successfully develop a market for the acquired licensed tracking technology to achieve a successful level of future operations 
if the company is unable to close the pending equity and debt transactions  it is likely that it will be unable to maintain its current nasdaq listing see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company cannot maintain its nasdaq listing  its ability to obtain the required levels of equity or debt financing from other sources to support its operations and fund payments of its obligations as they become due will be significantly reduced and it may have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material exposure to market risk associated with its cash and short term investments 
the company s senior notes payable are at a fixed rate and  thus  are not exposed to interest rate risk
