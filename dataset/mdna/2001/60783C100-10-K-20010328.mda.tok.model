management believes that the company s existing product lines and manufacturing capacity will enable the company to generate sufficient cash through operations  supplemented by the company s bank line of credit  to finance the company s business over the next twelve months 
however  additional cash resources may be required if the company s rate of growth exceeds currently anticipated levels

the construction or acquisition of new facilities could require significant additional capital 
for these reasons  among others  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in the future

this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the company adopted fin during the quarter ended september  this adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
the company s first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along to its customers increases in the costs of labor and materials 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuation in interest rates on our million credit facility 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the carrying value of the credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at the lower of libor plus additional interest of between and  or a rate equal to the greater of i the federal funds rate plus or ii the bank s prime rate  plus in either case an additional interest of between to 
we estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year
