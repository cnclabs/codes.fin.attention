our recent acquisition of qiave technologies corporation allowed us to expand our product line with a software based solution designed to protect server content and applications from unauthorized and unintentional access and manipulation 
our innovative subscription based livesecurity service delivers threat responses  software updates  expert editorials  support flashes and virus alerts over the internet  which enables enterprises to protect their data and communications in a continuously changing environment  with minimal effort 
since our inception  we have invested heavily in the development of our products and services and financed our operations as follows 
in september  we introduced our initial firebox security appliance and began selling our products both domestically and internationally 

in  we significantly expanded our worldwide sales and marketing efforts 

in  we launched our managed security offering for internet service providers and other managed service providers and introduced our second generation security appliance  which added significant functionality to our existing product lines 

in february  we launched the broadcast portion of our livesecurity service 

in july  we raised net proceeds of million in the initial public offering of our common stock 

in october  we acquired beadlenet  llc  a developer of internet security solutions for sohos  and formed our broadband internet security division 

in january  we announced the introduction of our security solutions for sohos and telecommuters  which we began shipping in the first quarter of 
in february  we raised net proceeds of million in a follow on public offering of our common stock 

in october  we acquired qiave  a developer of digital information security systems  which allowed us to expand our product line with serverlock  which protects server content and applications against unauthorized or unintentional changes 
sources of revenues and revenue recognition policy we generate revenues through 
sales of products and service subscriptions indirectly through our distribution network at a discount from list price  
sales of products and service subscriptions directly and  from time to time  indirectly through our distributors  to our service provider customers at volume pricing rates  and 
sales of service subscription renewals directly to our end users 
product revenues include 
the perpetual software license fees for our firebox system and the sale of our security appliance as part of our security solutions  
the sales of software options  such as vpn  
the sales of our network operations center  or noc  security suite software license and our security appliance as part of livesecurity for mss 
future product revenues will also include sales from our new serverlock product line 
service revenues include the annual fee for our livesecurity service  which is sold as part of our security solution  and for livesecurity subscription renewals from our enterprise customers and end users 
these services provide access to our livesecurity service for product updates  security threat responses  general security information and technical support 
these services also provide our service provider customers access to the livesecurity service and the ability to manage and update a specific number of their customers security appliances 
we recognize revenues only when a contract or agreement has been executed  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and we believe collection is probable 
while we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment  we defer revenues on product sales for two of our major distributors until these distributors have sold the product to their customers 
service subscription revenues are recognized ratably on a monthly basis  generally over a one year period 
recent acquisition in october  we acquired qiave 
the total consideration paid for qiave was approximately million  including approximately  in direct acquisition costs  and was comprised of  shares of watchguard common stock  including  shares that are subject to repurchase as described below 
total consideration for qiave included million in deferred stock based compensation charges  of which million related to the issuance of common stock subject to repurchase and million related to options we assumed to purchase  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated based on estimated fair values on the acquisition date  as determined by an independent appraisal  and excludes million in consideration related to deferred stock based compensation for common stock subject to restriction and unvested options we assumed in thousands fair value of qiave tangible assets  net of current liabilities intangible assets acquired workforce current technology  goodwill  total intangibles  acquired in process research and development  deferred stock based compensation  total consideration  including deferred stock based compensation  acquired workforce 
the value assigned to the workforce in place was determined using the avoided cost approach 
under this approach  the workforce is valued according to the costs watchguard avoided by obtaining a pre existing  trained and fully efficient team rather than assembling a workforce 
developed technology 
values assigned to the developed technology were determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  fair value reflects the present value of the projected earnings that are expected to be generated by the current technology 
to determine the value of the developed technology  watchguard discounted the expected future cash flows of the existing technology products at a rate of  taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of each product  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of each project 
based on this analysis  watchguard capitalized the existing technology that had reached technological feasibility 
the projected revenues used in the income approach are based on the future revenues that we believe will most likely be generated by the commercial sales of the technology 
stock based compensation 
in connection with the employment agreements and related stock retention agreements with four of qiave s key employees  a portion of the shares of common stock otherwise issuable to these employees pursuant to the merger agreement are subject to repurchase by us in the event that the employee s employment is terminated under specified circumstances 
these shares will be released from the repurchase restriction over a two year vesting period 
we recorded the value of this stock as deferred stock based compensation  based on the fair value of our common stock on the closing date of the merger 
we also recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with the assumption of unvested options to purchase qiave common stock  based on the intrinsic value of the unvested options at the closing date of the merger 
acquired in process research and development 
values assigned to acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  were determined using an income approach 
to determine the value of ipr d  we considered  among other factors  the state of development of each project  the time and cost needed to complete each project  expected income and associated risks  which include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and achieving technological feasibility and risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
this analysis resulted in amounts assigned to ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses 
we expensed the entire  allocated to acquired ipr d on the date of acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  we identified six ipr d projects as being related to future products for which technological or commercial feasibility had not yet been established and that did not have an alternative future use 
we analyzed each project  using estimated percentage completion factors ranging from to 
revenues attributable to qiave s ipr d were assumed to increase after each of the first three years of a five year projection period after the year of introduction  at annual rates ranging from to  decreasing to a growth rate in revenues after the fourth year in the projection 
projected annual revenues related to in process technology ranged from approximately million to million over the term of the projections 
these projections were based on aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  anticipated growth rates for the internet security market  anticipated product development and product introduction cycles and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
gross profit was assumed to remain at of revenues for each of the five years of the projection period 
operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative costs  were assumed to be of revenues in the initial year of the projection  declining to for each of the four remaining years 
we used a discount rate for valuing the acquired ipr d 
in arriving at the discount rate  we considered the implied rate of the transaction and the weighted average cost of capital 
we also took into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of each project  existing future markets and estimated life cycles of each project

over time  as volume levels increase  we expect the unit costs to manufacture our security appliances to continue to decrease 
competitive pressures in the future may lead to a negative impact on the gross margins of our existing product line 
however  we expect that product mix changes in the future  with the addition of software products such as our serverlock product line  will have a positive impact on gross margins 
cost of service revenues  which includes the costs of our technical support organization and costs associated with our livesecurity service  increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
this increase reflects an investment in our customer support organization to assist the growing number of customers who are implementing vpns in a more complex environment  in addition to a broader customer base 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of service revenues was for both and we expect service costs to increase in total dollar amount as our user base expands 
in the longer term  as revenues from livesecurity subscriptions increase and account for a greater percentage of total revenues  we expect our service margins to increase

the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects both increased productivity of and efficiencies in managing our distribution network and realization of our previous investments to expand distribution  capture market share and establish brand recognition of our products 
we will continue to invest in sales and marketing programs designed to increase distribution

however  gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of were negatively impacted by our product mix  in which lower margin products comprised a greater percentage of overall revenues than we expected 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we also made significant investments in our customer support organization  leading to an overall increase in the cost of service revenues 
while these investments had a negative short term impact on our gross margins during the quarter  we believe they were required to meet the needs of our expanding customer base 
we also made large investments in our sales and marketing organization during the fourth quarter of  leading to an overall increase in costs 
other significant increases in operating expenses during the quarter  including research and development costs  stock based compensation charges  acquired ipr d expenses and amortization of intangibles  were primarily related to our acquisition of qiave in october while our operating expenses continued to increase during in dollar amount  expenses continued to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will probably continue to fluctuate 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  we have seen a general economic downturn in the us economy  which has affected the demand for our products and services 
to the extent that this downturn continues or spreads to other geographic regions in which we conduct business  our future revenues are likely to be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock and  more recently  proceeds from our initial public offering in july and our follow on public offering in february to date  net proceeds from our private placements and public offerings have totaled approximately million 
we have a working capital revolving line of credit with a bank  secured by our accounts receivable 
the line of credit provides for borrowings not greater than million or the amount of the borrowing base 
for purposes of this loan  the borrowing base is the sum of of our eligible domestic accounts receivable and of our eligible foreign accounts receivable 
as of december   we had no borrowings on this line of credit  which expires in april and bears interest at the prime rate plus per year 
at december   our borrowing limit of million was reduced by a million unconditional letter of credit we issued to our landlord in conjunction with our new facilities lease 
in february  we repaid our two term loan facilities with the same bank  which had a combined balance of  as of december  in march  we signed a facilities lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office space for a new corporate headquarters located in seattle  washington 
this lease has a year term  with an option to extend for an additional five years 
this lease commenced in september and includes base rent of approximately  per month during the first year of the lease  increasing to  per month during the final year of the lease 
we are also responsible for our pro rata share of the building operating costs  which we estimate to be  per month during the first year of the lease 
we have exercised an option to lease approximately  square feet of additional space in the same building  which should commence in august we have subleased approximately  square feet of the space in our building  which will again become available to us over various periods beginning january through october as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  invested primarily in high quality money market accounts and marketable securities 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not material 
our working capital as of december  was million 
operating activities 
our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in and million in the operating cash outflows in and resulted primarily from significant investments in sales and marketing and research and development  all of which led to operating losses 
cash used in operating activities was net of noncash charges totaling million in and million in these noncash charges were primarily associated with depreciation and amortization of capital assets  amortization of goodwill  provisions for bad debts and sales returns and allowances  acquisition related charges such as acquired ipr d expenses  and compensation charges resulting from the issuance of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by working capital components for operating activities was million in  and cash utilized in working capital components for operating activities was million in in  there were large fluctuations within some major working capital components  as described below a receivables increased from million at december  to million at december   originating primarily from revenue generated in the fourth quarter of each year 
the increased receivable balance primarily reflects the increase in revenues from million in the three months ended december  to million in the three months ended december  days sales outstanding  or dsos  were days and days at december  and dsos are impacted by the payment terms contained in our customer contracts  linearity in revenues in any particular quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue contained in the receivable balance that has not been recognized as revenue 
the increase in dsos for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of primarily reflects changes in our customer sales mix during the fourth quarter 
our largest domestic customers and international customers receive longer payment terms  and the sales volume from these customers in the fourth quarter of was greater than in prior quarters and the comparable period in based on the current sales mix  the resulting timing differences arising from varying payment terms in our customer agreements  the linearity of revenues in any particular quarter and the growth of deferred revenue  we expect our dsos to generally range from days to days 
reserves for uncollectible accounts were  at december  and  at december   reflecting an increased accounts receivable balance related to increased sales to a broader customer base 
our returns and allowance reserves were  at december  and  at december   reflecting our estimate of returns and allowances associated with the return rights and price protection rights of some of our customers 
the reserve may fluctuate from time to time depending on the timing of product introductions and pricing program changes 
b inventories increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase reflects build up of inventory levels as a result of continued anticipated increases in product shipments  as well as inventory purchases related to our expanded product line 
in addition  inventory levels for those distributors for whom we recognize revenue on a sell through basis has increased due to our significant revenue growth associated with those distributors 
also contributing to the increase was the purchase of component parts on allocation or purchases of parts and components with long lead times 
we maintain a reserve for inventory obsolescence and will continue to review inventory on a periodic basis to ensure our reserves are adequate 
c prepaid expenses and other receivables increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in the interest receivable originating from the investment of proceeds from our public offerings 
d accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued payroll related expenses increased from million at december  to million at december   related to increased purchases of inventory and inventory components  increased headcount and increased operating expenses 
e deferred revenue increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting the deferral of revenue from bundled livesecurity subscriptions included in increased new product revenues and renewals of livesecurity subscriptions 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in and million in  reflecting short term investing activity and capital expenditures 
during and  investing activities also included capital expenditures for furniture and leasehold improvements in our new corporate headquarters 
in addition  in we funded the acquisition of beadlenet through cash payments of million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in these activities primarily relate to borrowings on our line of credit and through bridge financing during  proceeds from public offerings in the third quarter of and in the first quarter of  and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of employee stock options during cash provided from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan was  in  increasing to million in we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or technology investments for at least the next months 
however  if the underlying assumed levels of spending for the potential acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses or technologies prove to be inaccurate  we may need to seek additional funding before that time through public or private financings or other arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or derivative equity securities in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and debt securities available for sale consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio or million per issuer  with the exception of treasury securities and money market funds  which are exempt from this size limitation 
our policy limits all investments to those that mature in two years or less  with the average maturity of our investments equal to one year or less 
the securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  which is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses 
while we conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during and expect to continue to do so in the future  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be material to watchguard 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
