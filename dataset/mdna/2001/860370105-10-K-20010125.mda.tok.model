item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction death care businesses in the united states traditionally have been relatively small  family owned enterprises that have been passed down through successive generations within a family 
during the last decade  however  the industry in the united states  and in certain foreign countries  has undergone a transition in which family owned firms were consolidating with larger organizations  such as the company 
this trend began to change in fiscal year for further discussion of this trend  see the death care industry in item as a result  although the company s historical growth has been primarily from acquisitions  the company is currently focusing on cash flow  debt reduction and growth through internal strategies 
two other trends affecting the death care industry are the expected increase in the number of deaths and the average age of the population 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately percent per year from million in to million in in addition  industry studies indicate that the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
the aging of the population  particularly the baby boomers who have recently begun to turn  represents a significant opportunity for the company to expand its customer base and secure a portion of its future market share by actively marketing prearranged cemetery property and funeral services 
according to the bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age will increase from million in to million in the company s principal target market for prearranged cemetery sales is customers who are age and above 
certain statements made herein that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and therefore are inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements 
the discussion herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
trust and escrow investments the company s funeral and cemetery business includes prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements  as well as maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care funds 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts 
the company now defers all of the earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying funeral service is delivered 
previously  the company recognized a portion of these earnings and deferred the remainder to offset the estimated future effects of inflation 
the accounting change was made principally to match revenue recognition more closely with cash receipts and also to improve the comparability of its earnings with those of its principal competitors 
the new method allows the company to take a longer term view and increase its flexibility in managing the funeral trust funds 
this change generally has resulted in reduced near term funeral revenue and gross profit  due to the deferral of all of the earnings from funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the funeral is performed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company s investment strategy for these funds is  among other criteria  partially dependent on the ability to withdraw net realized capital gains from these funds 
however  withdrawal of capital gains is not permitted for perpetual care funds in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  funds for which net capital gains are permitted to be withdrawn typically are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting principally of us government securities  other interest bearing securities and preferred stocks rated a or better  blue chip publicly traded common stocks  money market funds and other short term investments 
income from funds  especially those invested partially in common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its north american funds including those in puerto rico and excluding those in mexico  which include investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual yield of approximately percent to percent 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular yield 
results of operations for purposes of the following discussion  funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated at the beginning of the earliest year presented in each comparison are referred to as existing operations 
correspondingly  funeral homes and cemeteries acquired or opened during either period being compared are referred to as acquired opened operations 
acquired operations include businesses purchased through the company s earlier acquisition strategies  and opened operations include constructed businesses or those developed through the implementation of the alternative service firm strategy 
comparisons between fiscal years and are presented as originally reported  whereas  comparisons between fiscal years and are presented as if the change in accounting principle had occurred november  the following table presents the results as reported for the fiscal years ended october  and and the pro forma results for the year ended october  year ended october  as report ed as reported pro forma in millions revenues funeral cemetery costs and expenses funeral cemetery gross profit corporate general and administrative expenses operating earnings before performance based stock options performance based stock options operating earnings interest expense  net other income  net earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income taxes earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle includes a nonrecurring  noncash charge of million million  after tax recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year in connection with the vesting of performance based stock options 
excluding that charge  for fiscal year a earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would have been million  and b earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would have been million 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  incre ase decre ase in millions funeral revenue existing operations acquired opened operations funeral costs existing operations acquired opened operations funeral segment profit funeral revenue increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from existing operations as a result of several factors 
first  the company experienced a percent increase in the average revenue per domestic funeral service performed by existing operations percent increase worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
the increase in average revenue per funeral service was due in part to enhanced funeral arranger training  improved merchandising and personalization of services and product offerings based on findings of the company s extensive consumer market study 
offsetting the increase in average revenue per funeral service was a million reduction in prearranged funeral merchandise sales  a million reduction in revenue from changes in foreign currency exchange rates principally the euro and a percent decrease  events in the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations percent decrease  events worldwide 
however  included in the  events were over low end direct cremation events that the company elected not to sell at prices its competitors were charging 
additionally  discount services provided in the ordinary course of business in the industry on behalf of other funeral homes or institutions declined by approximately events as a result of the company s decision to decrease its level of discounted services 
when these low end and discounted events are taken out of the calculation  the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations decreased by approximately events  which translates to less than one event per domestic core funeral home 
these low end and discounted events were price sensitive and generally not profitable 
changes in the company s preneed sales strategies during fiscal year had the effect of considerably reducing all preneed sales 
the company modified its preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
effective the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company also substantially reduced the commissions paid on sales of preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise  which the company believes had the largest impact on its preneed sales 
these changes were implemented in an effort to improve cash flow 
the company believes sales of preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise will not be recognized as revenue under sab until delivery 
while sab has not yet been implemented  the changes to the company s preneed sales strategies reflect the likely effects of sab although the company has experienced a reduction in all preneed sales  greater emphasis has been placed on increasing prearranged funeral service sales and preneed cemetery property sales 
the company believes that these are the sales that build and maintain market share 
the change will also better align the operations of the company with anticipated changes in accounting the company believes will be necessitated by the adoption of sab funeral profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in due primarily to the reduction in sales of prearranged funeral merchandise as described above 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of funeral homes from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 
historically  one of the company s goals has been to achieve to percent increases annually in the average revenue per funeral service performed by existing operations through a combination of price increases and improvements in merchandising 
for the year ended october   the average revenue per funeral service performed by existing funeral homes increased percent domestically and percent worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  which was below this objective 
because of intense and growing competition from low cost funeral service and merchandise providers in certain key markets in fiscal year  the company lowered its goals for increases in the average revenue per funeral service performed to to percent annually 
for the year ended october   the average revenue per funeral service performed by existing funeral homes increased percent domestically and percent worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
although these results exceeded the company s goals  the company is maintaining its goal of increases in average revenue per funeral service performed of to percent going forward  as it is too soon to determine if these results are indicative of a trend 
see forward looking statements below 
cemetery segment year ended october  increa se decrea se in millions cemetery revenue existing operations acquired opened operations cemtery costs existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery segment profit cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced a million  or percent  decrease in revenue from existing operations resulting primarily from reduced preneed sales 
slightly offsetting this decrease was an approximate million  or percent  increase in revenue from cemetery trust funds and escrow accounts to million 
this increase was due to an increase in the average yield on the funds coupled with an increase in the average balance 
the yield for the year was slightly higher than the company s goal of percent to percent 
changes in the company s preneed sales strategies during fiscal year  which are detailed in the funeral segment discussion above  had the effect of considerably reducing preneed cemetery sales 
cemetery profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in the decline was attributable principally to reduced preneed sales as described above  coupled with the high fixed cost nature of the cemetery business 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of cemeteries from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 
other corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to percent of revenue in fiscal year  as compared to percent in fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in consulting fees related to the company s extensive consumer market research project  partially offset by a reduction in corporate development costs  travel costs and executive bonus accruals 
net interest expense  which is comprised of gross interest expense of million  netted with investment income of million  increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year this is due principally to an increase in average interest rates from percent in to percent in  coupled with an increase in the average outstanding debt resulting from acquisitions that closed late in the increase in gross interest expense was partially offset by an approximate million increase in investment income generated from increased cash and cash equivalents earning an average rate of percent  including funds in foreign jurisdictions earning percent 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  effective march   the company pays a fixed rate of percent and receives three month libor 
the swap expires on march  as of october   the company s outstanding borrowings totaled million 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreement  approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  funeral segment year ended october  inc rease as reported pro forma in millions funeral revenues existing operations acquired opened operations funeral costs existing operations acquired opened operations funeral segment profit funeral revenue increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the company experienced an million  or percent  increase in revenue from existing operations as a result of an increase in sales of certain prearranged funeral merchandise  coupled with a percent increase in the average revenue per domestic funeral service performed by existing operations percent increase worldwide  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  primarily due to price increases and improved merchandising 
partially offsetting this increase was a percent  events decrease in the number of domestic funeral services performed by existing operations percent  events decrease worldwide 
funeral profit margin from existing operations increased from percent in to percent in this improvement resulted primarily from the increase in funeral revenue from existing operations discussed above  coupled with increased cost control measures  including contract negotiations with certain vendors and the company s centralization and standardization of certain financial and administrative functions through its shared services center 
the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of funeral homes from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 
the company believes that at need funeral revenues in some key markets were negatively affected in fiscal year by intense and growing price competition from low cost funeral providers and casket stores in some markets  the continuing and accelerating trend toward cremation  and a shift by customers to lower priced services and merchandise 
cemetery segment year ended october  increase as reported in millions cemetery revenue existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery costs existing operations acquired opened operations cemetery segment profit cemetery revenue increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the million  or percent  increase in revenue from existing operations resulted primarily from an increase in preneed cemetery sales  price increases and improved merchandising  coupled with an increase in the revenue realized from the company s cemetery trust funds and escrow accounts 
the revenue from the cemetery trust funds and escrow accounts increased million  or percent  to million due to a percent growth in the average balance in the funds  resulting from current year customer payments deposited into the funds and funds added through acquisitions  coupled with an increase in the average yield on the funds 
the yield was in line with the company s goal of percent to percent 
cemetery profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in this decline was attributable principally to a savings rebate received by the company from contract negotiations with a primary vendor in which was not obtained in the increase in revenue and costs from acquired opened operations resulted primarily from the company s acquisition and construction of cemeteries from november through october which were not owned for the entirety of both periods being presented 
other in april  the company achieved the performance goal for the performance based stock options granted under the company s incentive compensation plan 
as a result  the company was required to record a nonrecurring  noncash charge to earnings of approximately million approximately million  or 
per share  after tax in april the repurchase of options by the company and the exercise of the remaining options resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately million 
corporate general and administrative expenses declined to percent of revenue in fiscal year  as compared to percent in fiscal year  despite an aggregate increase of million for fiscal year the increase in these expenses is primarily the result of increasing activities to support the company s growth  including a  increase in professional and consulting fees 
net interest expense increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  resulting from an increase in average borrowings due principally to acquisition expenditures 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates from percent in to percent in and an increase in the investment earnings on excess cash for fiscal year as compared to in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  effective march   the company pays a fixed rate of percent and receives three month libor 
the swap expires on march  as of october   the company s outstanding borrowings totaled million 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreement  approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent 
the company experienced an increase in its effective tax rate from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year due to an increase in income from jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources early in fiscal year  the company s management resolved to improve cash flow and build cash reserves in order to deleverage the company s balance sheet 
the company s operations provided cash of million for the year ended october   compared to million for the corresponding period in  due principally to a smaller increase in receivables  coupled with other working capital changes 
the smaller increase in receivables resulted from increased cash collections combined with the impact of reduced preneed sales  both attributable to modifications made to the company s preneed sales strategies for increased cash retention  as discussed in item  under the heading operations prearrangements 
operating cash flow exceeded the company s goal of to million for the fiscal year 
as a result  the company had accumulated million in cash  cash equivalent investments and marketable securities as of october   an increase of approximately million from october  the company s investing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the reduction in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the cessation of acquisition activity in early  as discussed under the heading the death care industry in item  and due  to a smaller extent  to an increase in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and reductions in capital expenditures 
the company s financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million for fiscal year  due principally to debt repayments  compared to a cash inflow of million for fiscal year the level of cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the company s common stock offering completed in the second quarter of  which was slightly offset by the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock in the second half of in february  the company completed the sale of million shares of class a common stock 
this resulted in approximately million in net proceeds  which were used principally to repay balances outstanding under its revolving credit facilities 
the company paid million to current and former employees as a result of a self audit of pay procedures the company conducted in partnership with the department of labor dol 
the payment was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year stewart has revised its pay procedures and is in compliance with dol payroll regulations 
during fiscal year  the company expensed million with the remaining  to be expensed as preneed funeral services are delivered in future periods 
the company has implemented various initiatives to generate cash and reduce debt 
for example  the company has suspended its acquisition activity  restructured its preneed sales activities  limited spending on internal growth initiatives  and on october   the company s board of directors suspended the payment of quarterly dividends on class a and class b common stock 
another initiative being considered is the possible sale of some or all of the company s foreign operations 
the company has engaged an investment banking firm to assist in evaluating and executing this option if the company should decide to proceed 
currently  the company is in discussions with several interested parties 
a sale of some or all foreign assets could result in a material charge to earnings but could generate significant cash for debt reduction 
also  in addition to the company s regular communication with the lead bank in its revolving credit facility  during fiscal year the company met with all the lenders party to that facility to discuss plans for deleveraging its balance sheet and to develop a workable plan well in advance of the april maturity date of the company s revolving credit facility 
any amendments  renegotiations or extensions of the company s existing revolving credit and senior note agreements are likely to result in higher interest costs to the company  although the effect of the rate increases may be moderated if the company is able to substantially reduce its total debt prior to or in connection with such refinancing 
if the company is not successful in extending or renegotiating its current revolving credit agreement prior to the end of the company s second quarter of fiscal year  the revolving credit facility would become a current liability 
the following table reflects future scheduled principal payments or maturities of the company s long term debt in millions other  principally seller financing of year ending revolving public debt public debt acquired october  credit facility senior notes notes notes operations total thereafter subtotal option premium on remarketable or redeemable securities roars total long term debt for additional information on the company s debt  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item long term debt at october  decreased to million compared to million at october   as a result of a reduction of debt of million in fiscal year  offset by one seller financed acquisition which closed in the first quarter of fiscal year  although it had been completed in all of the company s debt is uncollateralized  except for approximately million of term notes incurred principally in connection with acquisitions 
in september  the company received regulatory approval in florida and in november  withdrew approximately million from its funeral trust funds and obtained a bond to guarantee performance under the related contracts in lieu of trusting requirements 
the company agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in the aggregate that will equal or exceed the bond amount related to these contracts 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover its estimated cost of providing the related prearranged services and products in the future 
subsequent to fiscal year  the company made million of regularly scheduled principal payments on its long term debt and million of additional principal payments to reduce the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility 
as a result  as of january   the company had cash  cash equivalent investments and marketable securities of approximately million and outstanding long term debt of million 
the most restrictive of the company s credit agreements require it to maintain a debt to equity ratio no higher than to the company has managed its capitalization within that limit  with a ratio of total debt to equity of 
to as of october  and as of january   the company had a debt to equity ratio of approximately 
to and million of additional borrowing capacity within this parameter  of which million was available under its revolving credit facility after providing for the amount that the company agreed would remain unused related to the bonding transaction discussed above 
additionally  the most restrictive of the company s credit agreements require it to maintain a coverage ratio  as defined by the agreement  of to on december   moody s investors service moody s announced that it had lowered the company s credit rating to ba and on august   announced that it had lowered the company s credit rating to ba on february   standard poor s s p announced that it had lowered the company s credit rating to bb and on july   announced that it had lowered the company s credit rating to bb 
previously  the company s credit ratings from moody s and s p were baa and bbb  respectively 
interest paid by the company on its revolving line of credit is based in part on its credit ratings from moody s and s p and is currently at its maximum pricing under the existing agreement 
the downgrades are estimated to have had an effect of less than million on the company s annual net earnings 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows years ended october  excludes the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 
pretax earnings for fiscal year include a nonrecurring  noncash charge of million in connection with the vesting of performance based stock options 
excluding the charge  the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal year would have been 
for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of pretax earnings plus fixed charges excluding interest capitalized during the period 
fixed charges consist of gross interest expense  capitalized interest  amortization of debt expense and discount or premium relating to any indebtedness  and the portion of rental expense that management believes to be representative of the interest component of rental expense 
fiscal years and reflect the change in accounting principle  fiscal years and reflect the change in accounting principles  fiscal year reflects the company s previous accounting methods that were in effect at that time 
during fiscal year  the company completed the acquisition of four cemeteries through seller financing at a net purchase price of million 
historically  the company s growth has been primarily from acquisitions 
this trend began to change in late fiscal year as industry conditions reduced the number of major consolidators participating in the acquisition market  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursuing transactions at lower prices 
as the business model shifted  death care consolidators experienced diminishing access to capital 
in response to these changes  the company began to develop strategies for improving cash flow and reducing and restructuring debt 
throughout fiscal year  the company focused on liquidity  leverage and cash flow 
additional information can be found in item under the heading initiatives cash flow initiatives 
as of january   the company had no pending acquisitions 
the company s current growth strategy focuses on achieving internal growth from existing operations and from new initiatives 
for example  during fiscal year  the company began to implement programs based on the results of its comprehensive study of consumer preferences 
the company has begun to offer more personalized services and products and has enhanced its funeral arranger training 
the company has also created a new sales and marketing division to strengthen sales effectiveness and create consistency in marketing  sales and training 
additional information about the company s internal growth initiatives is contained in the section titled initiatives in item during fiscal year  the company opened three new funeral homes in an operating partnership with the archdiocese of los angeles 
the fourth archdiocese of los angeles funeral home opened during the first fiscal quarter of  and a fifth funeral home is currently under construction 
the operating partnerships enable the company to build a total of nine funeral homes on cemetery land owned by the archdiocese 
thus far  the number of families serviced by the archdiocese funeral homes has exceeded management s expectations 
although the company has no material commitments for fiscal year other than approximately million related to construction of the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes  the company contemplates capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ending october   which includes million in internal growth initiatives including the construction of the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes and approximately million for maintenance capital expenditures 
with potential long term debt maturities of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  management of liquidity and capitalization represents a significant short and medium term priority for the company 
the company believes that its ability to meet its future capital requirements will depend primarily upon the successful implementation of its strategies to provide cash from operations and generate cash from other sources  such as the sale of some or all of its foreign operations  and its ability to refinance its revolving credit facility and public debt prior to or at their maturities 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s united states operations over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future

is required to be implemented in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year the company has begun its analysis of the impact of sfas nos 
 and on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations  and the pronouncements are not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
it is estimated that the adoption of the new standards will result in an increase in shareholders equity of approximately million 
this estimate is based on market information and the fair value of the company s three year interest rate swap as of october  the actual effect on the company s financial statements will depend on the fair value of the swap at the date of adoption 
the company and other industry participants continue to discuss directly with the staff of the sec the application of its recently issued sab as it relates to prearranged sales activities 
sab  which applies to all companies and was not directed at the death care industry  emphasizes among other matters the importance of physical delivery of a product or service to justify the recognition of revenue 
based on currently available information  the company believes that the implementation of sab will require a deferral of previously recorded revenue associated with prearranged sales 
the amounts deferred will be recognized in future years as the products and services that have been bought and paid for are ultimately delivered 
based on the tentative agreement with the sec staff  the company estimates that although there will be no negative impact on cash flow  had it adopted sab in fiscal year  before adjusting for the cumulative effect  the implementation would have reduced earnings by a range of to per share 
the company also estimates that had sab been adopted in fiscal year  it would have resulted in a nonrecurring  noncash million to million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of the changes 
implementation of sab would have resulted in an additional backlog that would have produced approximately billion of revenue in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
based on what the company currently knows  the implementation of sab should not cause a violation of any financial covenants in its debt agreements 
the sec and the industry have not reached a final resolution of these discussions  but the company anticipates that they will be finalized shortly 
the company is not required to implement the new accounting guidance until the fourth fiscal quarter of but may choose to implement the guidance earlier 
effective november   the company implemented statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  sop which requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
the implementation of sop did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein or elsewhere by or on behalf of the company that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company recently revised its short term outlook and goals 
management s current goal is to continue to increase its average revenue per funeral service performed worldwide at least to percent annually 
the company s goal is to grow its cemetery sales by percent over with costs increasing percent 
fiscal year goals also include spending million on internal growth initiatives 
the current tax rate anticipated for fiscal year is percent  and the company s weighted average cost of debt as of october   was percent 
during fiscal year  the company plans to continue its focus on improving liquidity and leverage 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
any refinancing of the company s debt is likely to be at interest rates substantially higher than those currently in effect  although the effect of the rate increases may be moderated if the company is able to substantially reduce its total debt prior to or in connection with such refinancing 
absent any nonrecurring charges related to the cumulative effect of implementing sab and any asset sales  the company s current goal for fiscal year is earnings per share consistent with fiscal year  and the company s goal is to increase earnings per share for fiscal year with accelerating improvement thereafter 
the company s goal is to million in cash flow from operations in fiscal year the company s cash flow initiatives detailed in item under the heading initiatives cash flow initiatives include analyzing the benefits associated with the sale of some or all of its foreign operations and analyzing excess cemetery property  under performing assets and real estate for sale or re deployment 
the potential sale of some or all foreign operations could result in a material charge to earnings but could generate significant cash for debt reduction 
in response to changes in the acquisition market discussed in item under the heading the death care industry  the company has not included acquisitions in its growth expectations for fiscal year and beyond 
forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and are therefore inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements below 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s ability to achieve its revenue goals and the corresponding cash flows from operations are affected by the volume  mix and prices of the properties  products and services sold 
the annual sales targets set by the company are aggressive  and the inability of the company to achieve planned levels of volume  mix or prices could cause the company not to meet anticipated revenue goals 
the ability of the company to achieve planned volume  mix or price levels at any location depends on numerous factors  including the local economy  the local death rate  cremation rates  competition and consumer preferences 
furthermore  the company may experience pricing pressures from low cost funeral service and merchandise providers  which could result in reduced volume or having to reduce funeral service and merchandise prices in order to recapture market share where appropriate 
preneed cemetery sales are a significant component of the company s cemetery revenue 
the company sets very aggressive preneed sales targets 
the inability of the company to achieve the planned level of sales could cause a shortfall in anticipated levels of revenue and net income 
changes in the sales organization  compensation thereof and sales terms and conditions of the company s preneed contracts could affect the company s ability to achieve its preneed sales targets 
morale is a key ingredient in any sales organization  and morale can be adversely affected by numerous factors  including aggressive sales targets that make it difficult for the company s approximately  commissioned sales counselors to achieve their goals 
when acquiring businesses  the company set pro forma levels at which it expected those businesses to perform based on the mix of traditional services and cremation services the businesses had historically delivered and how the company expected each business to perform over the following months 
as the company typically charges a higher price for a traditional service than a cremation service  material changes in the types of services delivered from those assumed in the pro forma could affect the level of anticipated revenue generated by those businesses 
additionally  although a cremation service can yield a higher margin than a traditional service  it generally produces lower revenue and a lower total gross profit 
the ability of the company to increase or sustain current price levels and retain market share is affected by local competition in the company s markets  including competition from low cost funeral providers and casket stores  as well as consumer preferences 
another important component of revenue is earnings from the company s cemetery trust funds and escrow accounts  which are determined by the size of  and returns which include dividends  interest and realized capital gains on  the funds 
the returns on the company s prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts affect the company s future revenue 
the performance of the funds depends primarily on market conditions that are not within the company s control 
additionally  the performance of the funds is affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities 
the size of the funds depends on the level of sales  funds added through acquisitions  if any  funds removed from the trust as preneed contracts turn at need and the amount of returns that are reinvested 
future revenue is also affected by the level of prearranged sales in prior periods 
the level of prearranged sales may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including deterioration in the economy  which causes individuals to have less discretionary income 
the death care business is a high fixed cost business 
positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on net earnings 
in order to address its long term debt maturities over the next three to four fiscal years  the company is considering selling some or all of its foreign operations 
given the current market environment  no assurance can be given that foreign assets can be sold 
it is likely that sales of operations in certain markets will be at prices below the carrying values of those assets and could result in a material charge to earnings but could generate significant cash for debt reduction 
sales of some or all foreign operations could result in a material reduction in revenue and  to a lesser extent  net earnings 
the company s planned cash flow initiatives for include analysis and possible sale or re deployment of excess cemetery property  under performing assets and real estate that would be more valuable if converted to another use 
no assurance can be given  however  that any significant portion of the company s assets can be sold  re deployed or converted on a profitable basis or that doing so will not result in a material charge to earnings 
the company first entered foreign markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be successful in operating in foreign markets or that any operations in foreign markets will yield results comparable to those realized through the company s expansion in the united states 
historically  in order to support its rapid growth  the company has periodically accessed capital markets including the secondary equity and debt markets  and the company may need to continue to do so in order to support future growth or to meet existing operating and debt service requirements even in the absence of significant future growth 
the company s ability to access these capital markets successfully in the future will depend on numerous factors  including the company s financial performance  stock market performance  changes in interest rates  any changes in the company s credit ratings and perceptions in the capital markets regarding the death care industry  the company s performance and future prospects 
additionally  any amendments  renegotiations or extensions of existing debt agreements are likely to result in higher interest costs to the company
