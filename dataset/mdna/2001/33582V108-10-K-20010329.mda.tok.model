therefore  separate income and expense amounts are not available for albion and are included in the first niagara and fnfg excluding acquisitions totals 
the effects of not including albion in the above disclosures is not deemed material 
total assets increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  asset growth was realized primarily due to the acquisitions during the year  which contributed over billion of assets comprised mostly of loans  which totaled million 
additionally  the company s continued emphasis on loan originations caused loans to increase million excluding loans acquired 
this loan growth was partially offset by a net decrease in securities available for sale of million  which served as the main funding source for the acquisitions 
total liabilities increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  approximately million of this increase was attributable to the acquisitions and includes million of additional borrowings utilized to fund the cayuga acquisition in the fourth quarter 
total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily due to loan growth of million 
lending activities total loans increased million  or  to billion at december  from million at december  this increase is mainly attributable to the acquisitions  which added approximately million of loans to the portfolio  and increased the company s loan origination capacity 
this increase occurred across all loan categories  but was primarily in one to four family residential real estate loans  which increased million  despite the sale of million of residential real estate loans in the fourth quarter  to help fund the cayuga acquisition 
similarly  home equity and commercial business loans increased million and million  respectively  or and 
this significant growth occurred not only as a result of the acquisitions  but also due to the company s emphasis on originating higher yielding loans to diversify the loan portfolio and improve net interest margins 
this emphasis also resulted in the company s commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loan portfolios increasing million and million  respectively 
the increase in consumer loans was mainly due to automobile loans  which increased million as a result of the expansion of the company s indirect lending programs and the acquisitions 
the company s focus on lending activities was also evident in as loans increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily in the one to four family residential and commercial real estate portfolios  which increased million and million  respectively 
this increase was reflective of the company s continued emphasis on the expansion of its real estate lending activities  indirect lending products  primarily recreational vehicle and automobile loans  as well as the establishment of a small business lending unit to focus on commercial business loans 
non accruing loans increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately  million of this million increase is attributable to the cayuga and cortland acquisitions  and not a deterioration in the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio 
the company s ratio of non accruing loans to total loans increased to at december   from at december   but was still below the at december  the company s allowance for credit losses decreased slightly as a percentage of total loans to at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future credit loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require the company to recognize additional provisions based on their judgement of information available to them at the time of their examination 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans 
investing activities the company s securities available for sale portfolio decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  during the company acquired investment securities totaling million from its bank acquisitions  which primarily consisted of mortgage backed  us government agency and municipal securities of million  million  and million  respectively 
however  this increase was more than offset by the sale and maturity of mortgage backed  asset backed and us treasury securities  used to fund the acquisitions and expanding loan portfolio  and resulted in a decrease in investment securities of million 
this decrease is consistent with management s strategy of investing the proceeds from the initial public offering in higher earning assets  such as loans  and companies that provide noninterest income 
as a result  securities available for sale only comprised of total assets at december  compared to at december   while loans comprised and of total assets  respectively 
securities available for sale decreased slightly from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of the wha acquisition and loan growth  partially offset by the company s leveraging strategy of utilizing fhlb advances to purchase higher yielding cmos with comparable maturities 
during  the company discontinued the leveraging strategy due to the increase in market borrowing rates during the first half of other activities in addition to the loans and investments obtained through acquisitions during the year  the company also acquired million of fhlb stock  million of bank owned life insurance and million of accrued interest receivable 
these were the primary contributors to the increase in other assets of million from million at december  to million at december  additionally  the company acquired million of premises and equipment and recorded million of goodwill as a result of the acquisitions 
during  the company purchased million of bank owned life insurance and million of fhlb stock 
funding activities the company s borrowed funds increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was almost exclusively attributable to the acquisition of the three banks during  which added million of fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements to the balance sheet 
additionally  in order to help fund the cayuga acquisition  fnfg borrowed million from the mhc and a commercial bank under short term variable rate loan agreements 
these increases were offset by the repayment of borrowings during the year  which were not replaced as the cash on hand  increase in deposits and sale and maturity of investment securities were more than adequate to meet the operational funding needs of the company 
total borrowings increased million during  as a result of a continuation of the company s borrowing reinvestment program begun in total deposits at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  when compared to the billion of deposits at december  this increase is primarily the result of eighteen branch locations obtained by the company through the three bank acquisitions and opening of two de novo branch locations by first niagara during the bank acquisitions contributed million of funding through deposits  which were primarily comprised of certificates of deposits  savings accounts and demand deposits of million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  the company s money market accounts and certificates of deposits increased million and million  excluding acquired balances  respectively 
this was a result of the company competitively pricing its money market accounts in order to compete with larger banks and mutual fund companies  and the higher interest rate environment during the first half of which caused money to flow from short term lower rate savings accounts to longer term higher rate certificates of deposits 
total deposits grew million during  primarily in the money market demand accounts 
equity activities the increase in stockholders equity of million  or  to million at december  from million at december  was primarily attributable to net income of million 
additionally  the company s accumulated other comprehensive income increased million as a result of the increase in the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale  due to the declining interest rate environment during the second half of  which caused the company s fixed rate debt  mortgage backed and asset backed securities to appreciate in value 
these increases were partially offset by fnfg s repurchase of common stock and payment of dividends  which caused stockholders equity to decrease million and million  respectively 
a total of  shares were repurchased during at an average price of per share as part of the capital management buy back program started in as a result of the acquisition activity during  repurchases of common stock have slowed considerably  as capital has been utilized to expand the company s strategic and competitive positions in the retail banking market 
stockholders equity decreased million from million at december  to million at december   as a result of the capital management buy back program

net interest income net interest income rose million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  additionally  the net interest margin was for compared to for the narrowing of the margin resulted primarily from a million  or  decline in average net earning assets to million in compared to million in  as funds previously available for investment in interest earning assets were utilized to fund the company s acquisition activity 
this decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase in the net interest rate spread  which can be attributed to the general increase in market interest rates  as well as the redeployment of funds from lower yielding investment securities into the higher yielding loan portfolio 
interest income rose million  or  from million in to million in this was mainly a result of the growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or  to billion in  as well as an increase in the interest rate earned on those assets of basis points for the same period 
interest income on loans increased million or to million for from million for this increase resulted from a increase in average loans outstanding during compared to  as well as a basis point increase in the average yield on loans over the same period 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest earned on investment and mortgage backed securities of million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield earned on these investments 
the increase in average yields earned on loans and investments can be attributed to the higher interest rate environment in compared to and the change in the company s asset and loan portfolio composition to higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is primarily attributable to interest expense on deposits  which increased million for the same period 
this was a result of a basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits  in addition to a million increase in the average balances 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase was a result of an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of million  in addition to an increase in the average rate paid on borrowed funds of basis points when comparing the year ending december  to the year ending december  the increase in the average rate paid on deposits and investments can be attributed to the higher interest rate environment in compared to and the change in liability and deposit mix to certificates of deposits and the company s competitively priced money market accounts which generally bear higher rates of interest 
provision for credit losses even with the significant increase in loans during and the shift in portfolio mix to higher risk categories such as commercial real estate  commercial loans and indirect consumer loans  the company did not experience a significant increase in net charge offs 
net charge offs for increased to  compared to  in and  in however  as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs decreased to for  from in and in given this  and the fact that the quality of the loan portfolio remains high  the company reduced the provision for credit losses to million for the year ending december   from million and million in and  respectively 
the provision is based on management s quarterly assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses with consideration given to such interrelated factors as the composition and inherent risk within the loan portfolio  the level of non accruing loans and charge offs  both current and historic economic conditions  as well as current trends related to regulatory supervision 
the company establishes provisions for credit losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
noninterest income noninterest income increased million  or  to million in from million in  as a result of the company s efforts to become less reliant on net interest income 
revenue associated with acquisitions  excluding albion  resulted in million of additional noninterest income for the year  of which million related to the investment advisory and commercial leasing subsidiaries acquired in other factors that contributed to the increase included third party benefit administration fees  bank owned life insurance income  debit card  credit card and deposit account fees and income from investments in limited partnerships 
noninterest income continues to be a stable source of earnings for the company  and represented of total revenue during noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million for the year ended december  reflecting a million  or  increase over the year ended december  total of million 
approximately million  or  of the increase in noninterest expense was attributable to the acquired companies  excluding albion  and was primarily in salaries and employee benefits 
as a result  salaries and employee benefits were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in during  the company s noninterest expense also continued to be impacted by the increased amortization of goodwill associated with its acquisitions  which increased million when compared to the same period in other increases related to the company s ongoing upgrade of technology and communications systems  expenses incurred for operating two new branch locations opened in early  and increased costs due to integration efforts of the acquired companies 
management anticipates the integration of the acquisitions will be completed during income taxes the effective tax rate increased to in from in  primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill related to the acquisitions 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  net income net income increased to million  or per share for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the earnings are exclusive of a one time  after tax contribution of million to fund the establishment of the first niagara bank foundation during net income represented a return on average assets in of compared to in  excluding the one time contribution 
the return on average equity in was compared to in  excluding the one time contribution 
the increase in the return on average equity in was enhanced by the impact of treasury stock repurchases 
net interest income net interest income increased to million in from million in this was mainly the result of the growth in average interest earning assets  which increased million  or to billion in from billion in interest income on loans increased to million for the period from million for the same period in the increase resulted from a increase in average loans outstanding during compared to the same period in  the benefits of which more than offset a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans over the same periods 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities in the available for sale portfolio increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  resulting from a million increase in the average balance of these securities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on these investments 
interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on deposits offset a million increase in the average balances 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  as a result of significant additional borrowings used to fund the loan growth 
the net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the narrowing of the margin resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average interest rate spread to in from in the decrease in the average interest rate spread reflects the general decline in market yields early in on average interest earning assets and the additional funding costs of borrowed funds  as well as interest bearing checking accounts  primarily money market demand accounts  which carry a market based cost of funds that is slightly higher than the other interest bearing liabilities of the company 
the decline in the average interest rate spread was partially offset by a increase in average net interest earning assets when comparing the two periods 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased to million in compared to million in net charge offs for totaled  compared to million in  with net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreasing to in from in noninterest income noninterest income increased to million in from million in several factors  primarily the acquisition of the insurance subsidiaries  which contributed million of noninterest income during  and the implementation of various treasury initiatives  furthered the company s efforts to be less reliant on net interest income 
additionally  premium income generated by a newly implemented equity covered call option program  tax exempt earnings on bank owned life insurance  as well as increased commissions received from the sale of third party annuity and mutual fund products had a positive impact on the year to date noninterest income 
the company s focus on generating core checking accounts  fees associated with a revised relationship checking account product  and continued growth in debit card usage also contributed to the increase in fee income 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million for the year ended december  reflecting an million increase over the year ended december  total of million 
included in the total was a one time expense of million related to funding the foundation 
approximately million of the noninterest expense for the year ended december  was attributable to the operation and acquisition of the insurance subsidiaries  primarily in salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  as well as goodwill amortization of million 
salaries and employee benefits were million in  an increase of million or from million in in addition to the insurance subsidiary costs  salaries and employee benefits increased due to newly implemented sales and incentive programs  new stock option award plans and increased staffing related to the expansion of the residential and commercial loan origination sales forces 
other increases relate to the company s ongoing upgrade of technology and communications systems  particularly the implementation of a home banking product in  expenses incurred for the opening of two new branch locations scheduled for opening in early  and professional and legal costs related to the analysis of potential acquisitions 
income taxes the effective tax rate increased to in from in  primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill related to the insurance subsidiary acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to the company s primary funding sources of income from operations  deposits and borrowings  additional funding is provided from the principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from the maturities and sale of investment securities  as well as proceeds from the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows  mortgage prepayments  mortgage loan sales  and borrowings are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the primary investing activities of the company are the origination of residential one to four family mortgages  commercial and multi family real estate loans  consumer loans  as well as the purchase of mortgage backed  debt and equity securities 
during  loan originations totaled million compared to million and million for and  respectively  while purchases of investment securities totaled million  million and million for the same periods 
the reduction in investment security purchases was due to the company funding five acquisitions during that required million of net cash outflow compared to only million in and none in the increased amount of security purchases in and were a result of the company s leveraging program in and investment of funds received from the initial public offering 
the sales  maturity and principal payments on investment securities  as well as deposit growth and existing liquid assets were used to fund the above investing activities 
during cash flow provided by the sale and maturity of securities available for sale amounted to million compared to million and million in and deposit growth  primarily the company s competitively priced money market and certificates of deposit accounts  provided million  million and million of funding for the years ending december   and  respectively 
additionally  with the addition of cayuga  the company now has the ability to accept municipal deposits  which totaled million at december  in addition to the sales of investment securities and deposit growth  fnfg borrowed million of funds from the mhc and a commercial bank in the fourth quarter to help fund the cayuga acquisition 
however  borrowings  excluding amounts acquired  decreased only slightly from as the increase in deposits and sale and maturity of investment securities were more than adequate to meet the funding needs of the company 
at december   outstanding loan commitments totaled million 
these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements since certain of these instruments may expire without being funded and others may not be fully drawn upon 
it is anticipated that there will be sufficient funds available to meet the current loan commitments and other obligations through the sources described above 
cash  interest bearing demand accounts at correspondent banks and federal funds sold are the company s most liquid assets 
the level of these assets are monitored daily and are dependent on operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
excess short term liquidity is usually invested in overnight federal funds sold 
in the event that funds beyond those generated internally are required  additional sources of funds are available through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances 
as of december   the total of cash  interest bearing demand accounts and federal funds sold was million  or of total assets 
fourth quarter results net income for the quarter ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in earnings per share increased to per share for the fourth quarter of compared to per share for the corresponding quarter in for the quarter ended december   total loans increased million to billion as compared to billion for the quarter ended september  during the quarter  the company obtained approximately million of loans as a result of the cayuga acquisition 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to the continued focus on loan origination efforts  partially offset by million in loan sales during the fourth quarter in order to fund the cayuga purchase 
correspondingly  interest income on loans increased to million for the fourth quarter of from million for the same period in the company s net interest rate spread  the difference in the interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  also improved due to the increase in the loan portfolio  as well as a change in asset mix from lower yielding investments to higher yielding loans 
for the three month period ended december   the spread improved basis points to as compared to for the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company had million in noninterest income  an increase of over the million for the same period in revenue associated with bank acquisitions resulted in  of additional noninterest income for the quarter 
further  income related to the company s investment advisory services  commercial leasing activities and third party benefit administration fees contributed  of income 
other factors included debit and credit card fees  service charges on deposit accounts and income from investments in limited partnerships noninterest expenses for the quarter ended december  increased to million from million for the corresponding period in expenses increased approximately million as a result of additional operating costs  primarily salaries and employee benefits  as well as occupancy and technology costs related to the cortland and cayuga operations 
similarly  the investment advisory and commercial leasing subsidiaries contributed  to the increase 
the company s noninterest expenses also continue to be impacted by the increased amortization of goodwill associated with its recent acquisitions which totaled million for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the same period in impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
these statements require that an entity recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of condition and measures those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which did not significantly impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company anticipates that adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and or stockholders equity in future periods 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
 which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  revises the standards related to the accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral 
this statement requires certain disclosures  but carries over most of the provisions of sfas no 
without consideration 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities of the company occurring after march  however  the provisions of sfas no 
concerning the recognition and reclassification of collateral and disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral were effective for the company for the year ended december  this statement is to be applied prospectively with certain exceptions 
adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements as the company generally does not enter into the types of transactions covered by this pronouncement 
in march  fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation was issued 
this interpretation clarifies the application of certain issues of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fin no 
 which was effective july   did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement  business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill 
if issued  the statement would require all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
acquired intangible assets other than goodwill would be amortized over their useful economic life  while goodwill and any acquired intangible asset with an indefinite useful economic life would not be amortized  but would be reviewed for impairment 
the goodwill and intangible asset provisions would be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after the statement s issuance 
however  there are no assurances that the fasb will issue a new accounting pronouncement or that if issued  it will contain the guidance discussed above 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  and recorded million of goodwill amortization expense during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the board s approved guidelines to reduce the vulnerability of operations to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee is comprised of senior management and selected banking officers under the direction of the board  with senior management responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
the company utilizes the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of residential monthly and bi weekly fixed rate mortgage loans having terms to maturity of not more than twenty years  residential and commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans  and consumer loans consisting primarily of mobile home loans  home equity loans  education loans  and recreational vehicle loans  selling substantially all newly originated year monthly and year bi weekly fixed rate  residential mortgage loans into the secondary market without recourse and on a servicing retained basis  and investing in shorter term securities which generally bear lower yields as compared to longer term investments  but which better position the company for increases in market interest rates 
shortening the maturities of the company s interest earning assets by increasing shorter term investments better matches the maturities of the company s deposit accounts  in particular its certificates of deposits that mature in one year or less  which  at december  totaled million  or of total interest bearing liabilities 
the company  on a limited basis  also enters into interest rate swap agreements with a third party to match more closely the repricing of its money market demand product 
the company intends to continue to analyze the future utilization of swap agreements as part of its overall asset liability management process 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was a negative 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position is likely to experience a decline in net interest income as the cost of its interest bearing liabilities increase at a rate faster than its yield on interest earning assets 
in comparison  an institution with a positive gap is likely to realize an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
given the company s existing liquidity position and its ability to sell securities from its available for sale portfolio  management believes that its negative gap position will not have a material adverse effect on its operating results or liquidity position 
if interest rates decrease  there may be a positive effect on the company s interest rate spread and corresponding operating results 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the repricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
one to four family residential loans were projected to repay at rates between and annually  while mortgage backed securities were projected to prepay at rates between and annually

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  which restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
as a result of these shortcomings  the company focuses more attention on simulation modeling  such as the net income and portfolio value analysis discussed below  rather than gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within the company s targeted range of acceptable limits  the net income and net portfolio value simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income and economic value trends 
net income and portfolio value analysis 
the accompanying table as of december  and sets forth the estimated impact on the company s net income resulting from changes in the interest rates during the next twelve months 
these estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage related investment prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates  and deposit maturities and decay rates similar to the gap analysis 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market condition

modeling changes in net income and npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net income and npv table presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net income and npv table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results
