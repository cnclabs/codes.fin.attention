we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  future and intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section entitled  risk factors affecting imagex 
com s operating results 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this report

overview imagex 
com is an internet based business to business e commerce company in the us commercial printing industry 
we derive substantially all our revenues from the e procurement and sale of printed business materials and software products and services which include graphic design and print file preparation software applications 
revenue for orders we receive through our corporate online printing center  we charge customers for the printed products they order in accordance with customer specific pricing arrangements negotiated with each account 
orders are fulfilled through our network of approximately vendors and three company owned facilities and shipped directly to customers under the imagex 
com brand 
in addition  service revenues related to the corporate online printing center are generated from creation of web sites and annual maintenance fee for the sites 
to date  we have derived the majority of our revenues from our corporate online printing center and from customers we obtained through acquisitions 
in  our revenue was supplemented by software product sales 
we sell software products to distributors and resellers and to some distributors that will reproduce  localize  and package our products 
we generally provide a sixty day right of return policy for consumer software sales 
a provision is recorded for estimated product returns 
orders placed through our small business printing center are fulfilled by an outsourced supplier 
we receive a percentage of the purchase price paid by customers for each order placed through the small business printing center 
as of december   the small business printing center had not generated significant revenues 
as an element of our sales and marketing strategy  we enter into strategic alliances with various parties 
in certain of these arrangements we have agreed to share revenue or pay transaction fees on revenue derived from the relationship  and in one case to pay a fixed monthly fee regardless of revenue generated 
these relationships have not generated any significant revenues to date 
in our corporate online printing center and small business printing center and through our wholly owned subsidiaries  image press  fine arts graphics  and howard press  we recognize product revenues when the order is shipped to the customer and we have fulfilled all of our contractual obligations 
for sale of extensis graphic design software  we recognize revenue when pervasive evidence of a contract exists  the software has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
distributors and resellers generally have a sixty day right of return 
a provision is recorded for estimated product returns 
in the commercial printing industry  prices tend to move in correlation with paper prices 
we generally have been able to pass fluctuations in paper pricing through to our customers  although this cannot be assured in the future 
we also offer volume discounts to customers  which we expect will continue 
our customers include a wide variety of businesses  from fortune companies to small office operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from customers that have come to imagex 
com by means of our acquisitions in and our goal in such acquisitions was to convert acquired customers to our online print procurement system 
although we intend to encourage  and generally expect  that a majority of the historical revenue of acquired companies will migrate to our online procurement system  such conversions require significant time and effort  and we expect that customers who elect to convert to online procurement will continue to order printing from us through traditional means while they transition to e procurement 
revenue generated through traditional means could continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenue 
gross profit for products sold through our corporate online printing center that are produced by our network of vendors  gross profit is calculated as the selling price of a specific product including freight less the price our vendor charges us and freight costs 
for products sold through our corporate online printing center that we produce in our own facilities  gross profit is calculated as the selling price of the product including freight  less manufacturing costs  freight costs and certain allocated overhead 
for software products  gross profit is the selling price less manufacturing costs and royalties 
operating expenses our business incurs operating expenses in three broad expense categories sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative 
historically  as is typical of early stage technology companies  expenses of all three categories increased significantly due to acquisitions  our expansion of sales force  and our focus on building the imagex 
com online printing system and an infrastructure suitable for future growth 
in the future  we intend to focus on increasing our revenue base and scalability by acquiring new customers  converting customers we acquired to our online system  increasing revenue from existing customers  and improving operation efficiency 
our future success will depend on our ability to achieve these objectives 
as a result  we expect that expenses of all categories will decline over time as a percentage of sales 
amortization of unearned compensation  goodwill and other intangibles amortization consists of the amortization of unearned compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of unearned compensation is a result of recording the difference between the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise or purchase price of such securities  as applicable 
the unearned compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the applicable stock or options 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets is a result of the acquisitions of fine arts graphics and image press in and creativepro 
com and howard press in the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets is over periods ranging from to years 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues 
historical periods have been restated to reflect our acquisition of printbid

selected statement of operations data year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  amortization of unearned compensation  goodwill  and other intangibles in process research and development total operating expenses  loss from operations  other income expense  net net loss  we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had accumulated a deficit of million 
our limited operating history and the uncertain and emerging nature of our market make it difficult to assess our prospects or predict our future results of operations 
therefore  you should not consider our recent revenue growth as an indication of our future rate of revenue growth  if any 
our prospects are subject to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered in establishing a new business enterprise  particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets for online products and services 
because of our short operating history  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely on such comparisons as indications of our future performance 
years ended december  and revenues revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of creativepro 
com and howard press customers in and to an increased number of customers using our online system  from approximately customers at december  to approximately customers at december  the increase in the number of customers contributes to both increased product and service revenues

this total unearned compensation amount represents the difference between the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes at the date of grant and the exercise or purchase price of such securities  as applicable 
the unamortized portion of this total unearned compensation amount is reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity and will be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the applicable stock or options 
the unearned compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options  generally four years  using an accelerated method 
we expect that the amortization of unearned compensation will decrease in the future due to the accelerated amortization method being used

given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we do not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax assets meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded

with the proceeds of our public offering in august  all existing debt was paid off and the remaining proceeds were invested which resulted in a net interest income for the year ended december  income taxes no provision for federal income taxes was recorded to date because we incurred net operating losses from inception through december  as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  expiring in through these losses were available to offset future taxable income 
given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we do not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax assets meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  no deferred tax asset was recorded 
net loss the net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the million increase in net loss for the year ended december  was as a result of increased spending in all categories sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  and amortization  as we completed three acquisitions and had significant growth overall during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources in february and march we completed our follow on offering of common stock and issued additional  shares at per share 
the net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million from cash and cash equivalents held as of december  our working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the operating cash outflows were primarily attributable to significant expenditures on product development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  all of which led to operating losses

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our follow on offering 
we also received proceeds of million from borrowing of long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and net proceeds from our initial public offering in august we anticipate continued capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel  including growth associated with product and service offerings  geographic expansion and integration of any newly acquired businesses 
we may increase our operating expenses which will consume a material amount of our cash resources  however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with available credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including our rate of revenue growth  our operating losses  the cost of obtaining new customers and technical capabilities  and the cost of upgrading and maintaining our network infrastructure and other systems 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the new standard is effective for the company beginning january  because the company has never used nor currently intends to use derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of this new standard will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company

sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec

fin became effective on july  the adoption of fin had no material effect on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
impact of inflation although the company has not attempted to calculate the effect of inflation  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in the future  increases in costs and expenses  particularly raw materials and labor costs may have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such cost increases cannot be passed along to the customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
our million term loan bears interest at libor plus 
our million revolving credit line bears interest at libor plus and prime plus 
both are scheduled for repayments within five years 
related expense would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december
