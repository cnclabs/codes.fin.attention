for net interest income net interest income increased to million for  in comparison with million for this was primarily due to a million increase in the positive variance between average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities resulting from higher volumes in commercial business loans  commercial real estate loans  lease financing receivables and investments which were partially offset by increased time deposit volume and short term borrowings 
despite numerous rate increases by the federal reserve  the company has sufficiently managed its increasing cost of funds by deploying capital into higher yielding investments and variable rate loans 
the net interest margin was for compared to for  the slight decline was primarily due to higher deposit rates in partially offset by higher yields on commercial business loans  construction loans and investments in net interest income increased to million for  in comparison with million for this was primarily due to a million increase in the positive variance between average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities resulting from higher volumes in commercial real estate loans  construction loans  commercial business loans  lease financing receivables and investment securities partially offset by increased deposit volume 
the net interest margin was for compared to for  the slight decline was primarily due to higher yields on commercial business loans and lease financing in partially offset by higher deposit rates in provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses represents the charge against earnings that is required to fund the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the level of the allowance is determined by known and inherent risks within the bank s loan and lease portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation is based upon an examination of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to loan growth and to increase the reserve coverage as a result of the current economic climate 
the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million in compared to  in the increase was due to increases in the loan and lease portfolio and non performing loans and leases  an additional charge of million as a result of a new charge off policy at plc  and a charge of  due to the deterioration of a commercial manufacturing customer s credit 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total non performing loans and leases was  and at december   and  respectively 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for loan and lease losses  there can be no assurance that the bank will not have to increase its provision for loan and lease losses in the future as a result of adverse market conditions for real estate in the bank s primary market area  future increases in non performing loans and leases  or for other reasons 
any such increase could adversely affect the bank s results of operations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses and the carrying value of its other non performing assets 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to its allowance for losses based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the company and the bank were most recently examined by the office of thrift supervision ots as of june  non interest income non interest income increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in financial services fee income and a million gain on the sale of the leasing division partially offset by a million decrease in equity in unconsolidated entities 
private equity fund management fees increased million primarily generated by the company s subsidiary pcm  which manages the mezzanine debt and venture capital funds 
mutual fund  annuity and insurance commissions increased million from the company s subsidiary pfr 
consulting fees of  were generated during by the company s subsidiary kmr  which provides financial and operational management consulting services for commercial clients 
in december  the company sold the assets of its maryland based leasing division that resulted in the sale of million of lease financing receivables and a gain of million 
the losses in unconsolidated entities of million in primarily relate to ben franklin and newspring of which the company owns approximately and  respectively  and which are accounted for under the equity method 
these losses represent a partial reversal of unrealized gains reported in the third and fourth quarters of the company recognized million of client warrant income during due to the expiration of restrictions on the sale of warrants to acquire common stock of internet capital group  inc icge  us interactive  inc 
and emax solutions partners  inc the company recognized client warrant income of million from the sale of and market value adjustments on shares of icge  million from market value adjustments on us interactive warrants and  was on the sale of emax warrants back to sciquest 
com in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of emax by sciquest 
com 
the company has obtained rights to acquire stock in the form of warrants in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan convenants or other collateral control techniques employed by the company to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming  and collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond the control of the company  including the general condition of the public equity markets and restrictions on sales as well as the merger and acquisition environment 
therefore  income from the disposition of client warrants cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy and is likely to vary materially from period to period 
as opportunities present themselves in future periods  the company may continue to reinvest some or all of the income realized from the disposition of client warrants in furthering its business strategies 
additional information on warrants held by the company can be found under business banking techbanc 
a gain on sale of securities of  was recorded during from the sale of  shares adjusted for a for split of common stock of icge which the company acquired through an investment in a convertible note of icge made by it venture capital subsidiary

the company realized million of client warrant income from the sale and market value adjustments on shares of verticalnet 
the company realized  of client warrant income on sales of common shares of iqeplc 
equity in unconsolidated entities of million in represents an increase of million over primarily due to the company s equity investment in the ben franklin progress capital fund  lp the increase in equity investment is primarily due to the unrealized appreciation of investments in internet capital group  inc and verticalnet  inc 
held by ben franklin progress capital fund  lp during  securities were sold for a loss of  primarily as part of a restructuring of investments to higher interest rates as compared to a gain on sale of securities of  in non interest expense non interest expense for amounted to million compared to million in excluding non recurring expenses of  during related to data system conversion costs  a  write down of goodwill during related to the sale of certain offices of pra known as the amic division  and million in associated with a leasing acquisition and unrelated adjustments  non interest expense increased million 
this increase was partially due to a million increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of additional employees to staff new bank branches  the acquisition of kmr  the staffing of pcm  commissions at pfr and from other new positions established within the company 
occupancy and furniture  fixtures and equipment expenses increased million mainly due to a new operations center  bringing data processing in house and new branch openings 
professional services expense  excluding  in data system conversion related expenses in  increased  primarily due to consulting costs associated with the business generated by the company s subsidiaries pcm and kmr and legal costs associated with aggressive collection efforts on charged off loans and leases 
real estate owned expenses increased  primarily due to construction management and legal expenses related to residential real estate development projects  classified as real estate owned 
loan expenses increased  primarily due to lease financing broker fees 
capital securities expense increased  due to the issuance of million of capital securities in july non interest expense increased to million in in comparison with million for excluding non recurring expenses of million in associated with a leasing acquisition and unrelated adjustments  non interest expense increased million 
this increase was partially due to a million increase in salaries and employee benefits relating to employees of acquired and newly formed companies and new positions within the company 
professional services increased by  mainly due to the outsourcing of the internal audit function  consulting fees for year systems testing and increased tax services 
occupancy and furniture  fixtures and equipment expenses increased  due to new branch openings and recent acquisitions 
other non interest expense for included a  loss on the sale of equipment at plc from the liquidation of leased property 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of million during compared to million in and million in  gross of the tax benefit of  due to the cumulative effect of accounting change 
income tax expense from the gain on sale of and income from discontinued operations was million during income tax expense on income from discontinued operations was  in and  in the changes in income tax expense were primarily due to changes in taxable income 
liquidity and funding the company must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its funding requirements for loan and lease commitments  scheduled debt repayments  operating expenses  and deposit withdrawals 
the bank is the primary source of working capital for the company 
at december   the bank met all regulatory capital liquidity requirements 
the company s need for liquidity is affected by loan demand and net changes in retail deposit levels 
the company can minimize the cash required during the times of heavy loan demand by modifying its credit policies or reducing its marketing efforts 
liquidity demand caused by net reductions in retail deposits is usually caused by factors over which the company has limited control 
the company derives its liquidity from both its assets and liabilities 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
liquidity is derived from liabilities by maintaining a variety of funding sources  including retail deposits  fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
at december   the total of approved loan commitments amounted to million  and the company had million of undisbursed loan funds 
at december   total fhlb borrowings that are scheduled to mature during the months ending december  totaled million 
at december   total securities purchased under agreement to resell which are scheduled to mature during the months ended december   totaled million 
at december   the amount of time deposits that are scheduled to mature within months totaled million  a substantial portion of which management believes  on the basis of prior experience  will remain in the company

as a member of the fhlb  the bank is required to own capital stock in the fhlb and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of its home mortgages and other assets principally securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states  provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of a savings bank s assets or on the fhlb s assessment of the savings bank s creditworthiness 
the fhlb credit policies may change from time to time at its discretion 
the bank s maximum borrowing authority from the fhlb on december  was approximately million 
the company s primary sources of funds have historically consisted of deposits  amortization and prepayments of outstanding loans  fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities 
during and  the company used its capital resources primarily to meet its ongoing commitments to fund maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals  fund existing and continuing loan commitments  and maintain its liquidity

the prompt corrective action regulations defined specific capital categories based on an institution s capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized  an institution must generally have a tangible equity ratio of at least  a tier or leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a tangible equity ratio of or less

the following table sets forth the scheduled contractual maturities of the company s commercial loans at december  the following table also sets forth the dollar amount of commercial loans scheduled to mature after one year which have fixed or adjustable rates

the average maturity of commercial loans is less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments and refinancings 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are lower than current mortgage loan rates due to refinancing of adjustable rate and fixed rate loans at lower rates 
under the circumstances  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are paid or refinanced at lower rates

the amount of interest income that was actually recorded during  and with respect to such non accrual loans and leases amounted to approximately   and  respectively 
the million of non accrual loans and leases at december  consists of  of loans secured by single family residential property   of loans secured by commercial property  million of commercial business loans   of consumer loans and million of lease financing 
the accrual of interest on commercial loans  mortgage loans and leases is generally discontinued when the loans and leases become days past due and when  in management s judgement  it is determined that a reasonable doubt exists as to collectibility 
the accrual of interest is also discontinued on residential and consumer loans when such loans become days past due  except for those loans in the process of collection which are secured by cash collateral or by real estate with a loan to value less than for first mortgage loans and less than for second mortgage loans 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income 
additional interest income on such loans is recognized only when received 
a loan remains on non accrual status until the factors which indicate doubtful collectibility no longer exist  or the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
all loans and leases are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is deemed insufficient to warrant further accrual 
the increase in other real estate owned since december  was primarily related to residential real estate development projects  acquired by the company through deeds in lieu of foreclosure as a result of defaulted loans the following table sets forth information concerning the principal balances and percent of the total loan and lease portfolio represented by delinquent loans and leases at the dates indicated at of december  amount percent amount percent amount percent delinquencies to days    to days

an allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for potential losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon examination of the portfolio  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  the results of the most recent regulatory examinations  and other relevant factors 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making such evaluations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management the major objectives of the company s asset and liability management are to manage exposure to changes in the interest rate environment  to ensure adequate liquidity and funding  to preserve and build capital  and to maximize net interest income opportunities 
the company manages these objectives through its asset liability and investment committee 
the committee meets monthly to develop strategies that affect the future level of net interest income  liquidity and capital 
the committee utilizes cash flow forecasts  considers current economic conditions and the direction of interest rates  and manages the bank s risk to such changes 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or as having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  an institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or as having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing is less than the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap should result in an increase in net interest income  and in a rising interest rate environment  a negative gap should adversely affect net interest income 
the converse would be true for a positive gap 
however  shortcomings are inherent in a simplified gap analysis that may result in an institution with a nominally negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have a similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap 
management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides a more meaningful measure of interest rate risk 
simulation analysis incorporates the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice as well as the probability that they will do so 
simulation in net interest income over a two year period also incorporates the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  simulation analysis permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over the next months in a flat rate scenario 
the flat rate model projects growth in the loan portfolio and projects the mix of accounts within the loan portfolio 
in addition  the company must also make certain assumptions regarding the movement of the rates on its assets and liabilities  especially its deposit rates 
the company projects net interest income in a rising rate scenario of basis points over a month period as well as a basis point decrease in a declining rate scenario during this same period 
the company then determines its interest rate sensitivity by calculating the difference in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios versus the flat rate scenario
