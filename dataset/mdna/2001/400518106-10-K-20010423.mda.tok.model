general the company operates on a to week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in february and fiscal ended on february  the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized online lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
service revenues have been derived primarily from lottery service contracts 
these contracts are typically at least five years in duration  and are generally based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online lottery sales 
these percentages vary depending on the size of the lottery and the scope of services provided to the lottery 
product sale revenues have been derived primarily from the installation of new online lottery systems  installation of new software and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
the size and timing of these transactions have resulted in variability in product sale revenues from period to period 
the company currently anticipates that product sales during fiscal will be in a range of million to million 
the company has taken steps to broaden its offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of its core business of providing online lottery services 
for example  the company has entered into agreements which permit bill payments over its brazilian and chilean lottery networks 
in addition  the company continues to develop  and where permitted  market  its uwin internet based platform through which international providers of government sponsored lottery products and services may offer interactive games 
the company s business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
awards of contracts to the company are  from time to time  challenged by competitors 
further  there have been and may continue to be investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations  conducted by governmental authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
in light of the fact that such investigations frequently are conducted in secret  the company would not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation which might involve the company 
because the company s reputation for integrity is an important factor in its business dealings with lottery and other government agencies  if government authorities were to make an allegation of  or if there were to be a finding of  improper conduct on the part of or attributable to the company in any matter  such an allegation or finding could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including its ability to retain existing contracts and to obtain new or renewal contracts 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have such a material adverse effect

the principal sources of liquidity for the company are expected to be cash generated from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility

market risk disclosures the primary market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and exposures is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes is not considered material and is managed through its procurement and sales practices 
the company did not own any marketable equity securities during fiscal interest rates interest rate market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the company s total debt or current earnings resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
at february   and february   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  as determined by an independent investment banker  approximated million and million  respectively 
at february   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would change the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would change the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million 
comparatively  at february   after taking into consideration million of interest rate swaps  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would change the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would change the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million 
a hypothetical adverse or favorable change in interest rates applied to variable rate debt would not have a material affect on current earnings 
the company uses various techniques to mitigate the risk associated with future changes in interest rates  including entering into interest rate swaps and the private placement of fixed rate debt 
in february  the company entered into two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million that provided interest rate protection over the period february  to may  the swaps effectively entitled the company to exchange fixed rate payments for variable rate payments 
on february   the company sold the two interest rate swaps for million 
the company has deferred the recognition of the gain on the sale as a component of long term debt and is recognizing such gain ratably over the period february through may foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange exposures arise from current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into united states dollar balance sheet accounts 
the company seeks to manage its foreign exchange risk by securing payment from its customers in us dollars  by sharing risk with its customers  by utilizing foreign currency borrowings  by leading and lagging receipts and payments and by entering into foreign currency exchange and option contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the costs attributable to the company s foreign currency revenues are payable in the local currencies 
whenever possible  the company negotiates clauses into its contracts that allow for price adjustments should a material change in foreign exchange rates occur 
the company  from time to time  enters into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce the exposure associated with current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a translation loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in the equity section of the company s balance sheet 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net transaction loss of million in both years that would be recorded in current earnings after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place 
at february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net reduction of cash flows from anticipatory transactions in fiscal of million 
comparatively  at february   the result of a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a net reduction of cash flows from anticipatory transactions of million in fiscal the percentage of fiscal and fiscal anticipatory cash flows that were hedged varied throughout each fiscal year  but averaged in fiscal compared to in fiscal as of february   the company had contracts for the sale of foreign currency of approximately million primarily spanish pesetas  australian dollars and pounds sterling and the purchase of foreign currency of approximately million primarily pounds sterling  compared to contracts for the sale of foreign currency of approximately million primarily spanish pesetas  south african rand and irish punts and the purchase of foreign currency of approximately million primarily pounds sterling at february item a
