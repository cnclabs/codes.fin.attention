overview the following discussion compares fiscal years and and fiscal years and  which reflects the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the results of the acquisitions listed in the chart below  from their respective dates of acquisition  are included in the discussion below of the fiscal year in which such acquisition occurred

income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were million  a decrease of approximately million or from the net sales of million for the fiscal year ended september  comparable store sales declined by stores in base for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a decrease of stores in base during the prior fiscal year 
management believes the decline in net sales and the decrease in comparable store sales was related to various factors including  but not limited to  erratic levels of consumer confidence  persistent weak economic and industry conditions and high fuel prices 
in certain markets these factors have been exaggerated by weather conditions related to the severe impact of tropical storm allison along the texas and louisiana coastlines 
net sales were also impacted by i a significant percentage decline in net sales specifically during the month of september and ii the closing of store locations in miami  florida and huntsville  alabama during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal prior to their closing  the miami and huntsville store locations had combined sales of approximately million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
in reviewing these store locations  the company determined that each store had a sales overlap with certain other travis boating center locations and that the company could likely more cost effectively serve its customers through such alternate store locations 
included within net sales is revenue that the company earns related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow the company to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender  and the company earns fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate the rate spread 
the company sells these loans without recourse  except that in certain instances the company must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
the company also sells  as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
the company may also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products decreased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  f i income as a percentage of net sales also decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to i lower overall net sales  ii reductions in overall yields paid by lenders for originating customer finance contracts  iii competitive pressures on finance rates which resulted in lower net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing and iv with regard to our store locations in arkansas  certain caps or limits on interest rates allowed to be charged by lenders in arkansas 
decreases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through  particularly by purchasers of the larger  more expensive boats and reduced customer demand for certain insurance products have also been limiting factors 
based on these circumstances and recent attempts by certain manufacturers to enhance certain manufacturer warranty products  the company believes that net sales of f i products may continue to decline somewhat prior to ultimately stabilizing 
gross profit 
for the fiscal year ended  september   gross profit decreased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased to from during the same period 
the decrease in gross profit  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily related to the company and certain of its manufacturers offering additional incentives and rebates on various models of boats and outboard engines 
the manufacturer incentives and rebates were developed by the manufacturers as part of an effort to stimulate sales due to overall weak industry sales performance 
additionally  the company developed other incentives as part of its ongoing inventory reduction plan implemented previously during the summer of the prior fiscal year 
management believes that these programs or similar levels of additional incentives and rebates will continue for at least the first and second quarters of fiscal or until economic and industry conditions improve 
while these programs have impacted gross profit  the company has been successful in reducing overall inventory levels 
the company s inventory levels were approximately million as of september  versus million as of september  see liquidity and capital resources 
the decline in net sales attributable to f i products has also impacted the gross profit margin 
net sales of these f i products  which have a significant impact on the gross profit margin  contributed million  or  of total gross profit in fiscal  as compared to million  or  of total gross profit for fiscal net sales attributable to f i products are reported on a net basis and therefore all of such sales contribute directly to the company s gross profit 
the costs associated with the sale of f i products are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal the company also had expenses of approximately  related to closing of the store locations in miami  florida and huntsville  alabama 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in actual dollars for the fiscal year ended september  versus the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the reduction in wages  commissions and travel entertainment expenses 
the company has reduced headcount primarily through attrition and selective position consolidation 
the reduction in overall expenses was offset by increases in certain expenses such as utilities  insurance  fuel costs  rent lease expense and bad debt expense related to reserves on certain accounts receivable 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to in fiscal from for prior fiscal year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily attributable to the depreciation expenses of the company s recently completed superstore location in san antonio  texas  substantial renovations to the clearwater  florida store location and other improvements to its asset infrastructure 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
however  interest expense increased to from of net sales in fiscal years and fiscal  respectively  primarily as a result of the overall decline in net sales for the fiscal year 
interest expense  in actual dollars  was positively impacted by decreases in the company s short term borrowing rates and inventory debt levels relative to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense was somewhat offset by the incremental interest expense incurred on the additional long term debt related to the company s new superstore in san antonio  texas and other real estate holdings 
the company anticipates continuing to utilize significant amounts of third party financing sources to support its inventories and other assets 
accordingly  the company is subject to the impact of increases in interest expenses and other costs associated with such borrowings 
see risk factors our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
net income loss 
the company posted a net loss of approximately million for fiscal versus a net income of approximately  in fiscal primarily due to the above described declines in net sales and total gross profit margins 
fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of the increase in net sales during the fiscal year was the result of the ft 
myers store location opened in september  and store locations in pompano and stuart  florida opened during the fiscal year 
accordingly  of the increase in net sales of million during fiscal  million  or  is related to these three store locations opened during the discussed periods 
during fiscal  the increase in net sales included incremental revenues related to sales of parts accessories  service labor and used boats  as a result of newly added or expanded parts accessory and service departments in various store locations and the increased number of store locations in operation 
parts accessory sales increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal years and  respectively 
service labor sales increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal years and  respectively 
used boat sales increased to million  or of net sales in fiscal  from million  or of net sales in fiscal included in the used boat sales for fiscal are approximately million in wholesale transactions  some of which were related to the company s planned reduction in overall inventory levels primarily occurring during the fiscal quarter ended september  during fiscal  comparable store sales decreased by  or million  stores in base versus an increase of  or million  stores in base during fiscal management believes that the comparable store sales decrease was related to various factors including poor weather  higher overall interest rates  erratic levels of consumer confidence and the number of stores eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base calculations 
the company relocated or renovated six stores and opened or acquired an additional stores during fiscal years and rendering such locations to be excluded from the comparable store base 
included within net sales is revenue that the company earns related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow the company to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender  and the company earns fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate the rate spread 
the company sells these loans without recourse  except that in certain instances the company must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
the company also sells  as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
the company may also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products increased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  f i income as a percentage of net sales decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to lower overall yields paid by lenders for originating customer finance contracts and competitive pressures on finance rates which resulted in lower net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing 
decreases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through  particularly by purchasers of the larger  more expensive boats and reduced customer demand for certain insurance products have also been limiting factors 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company generally seeks to maintain a gross profit margin of to on its boating packages and to further leverage the margin through sales of parts accessories  service labor and f i products  all of which generally produce gross profit margins in excess of 
during the fiscal year  the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by certain events including the establishment of reserve allowances on inventory in the amount of approximately million  including a reserve of approximately  related to an alleged theft and other fraudulent activities of a single former store manager 
the company also undertook a summer sales campaign to reduce overall inventory levels to improve inventory turn and reduce carrying costs 
management estimates the incremental expense to the gross profit to facilitate these sales promotions and retail price reductions on inventory sold to be approximately million 
net sales attributable to f i products  which have a significant impact on the gross profit margin  contributed million  or  of total gross profit in fiscal  as compared to million  or  of total gross profit for fiscal net sales attributable to f i products are reported on a net basis and therefore all of such sales contribute directly to the company s gross profit 
the costs associated with the sale of f i products are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to in fiscal from for fiscal the increase  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily attributable to increased lease and other expenses associated with the operation of a larger store network  growth in the corporate office staffing infrastructure and increased advertising and insurance costs associated with introducing travis stores into new geographically diverse regions 
interest expense 
interest expense  in absolute dollars  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense as a percent of net sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the company s capital expenditures and growth in operating assets primarily inventory have been financed with borrowings from various commercial banks and finance companies 
the growth in assets is the result of the company s larger store network  continued implementation of its management information system  the construction of new superstore facilities in atlanta  georgia and san antonio  texas and renovations of other store locations to conform with its superstore standards 
the higher debt levels and significantly higher short term borrowing rates relative to the increases in the prime rate during fiscal have also negatively impacted interest expense 
the company s weighted average interest rate on its inventory financing was approximately and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company anticipates continuing to utilize third party financing sources to support the growth in assets necessary to operate a larger store network and accordingly  the resulting increases in interest expense associated with such borrowings 
see risk factors our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
net income 
net income decreased by to approximately  in fiscal from million in fiscal while the company experienced an increase in net sales during fiscal  the reduction in gross profit margins  higher levels of s  g  a expenses and the increase in interest expense negatively impacted net income

strong sales typically begin in january with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows  and continue through july 
over the previous three fiscal years  the average annual net sales for the quarterly periods ended march and june represented in excess of and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
with regard to net income  the company historically generates profits in three of its fiscal quarters and experiences operating losses in the quarter ended december due to a broad seasonal slowdown in sales 
during the quarter ended september  inventory typically reaches its lowest levels and accumulated cash reserves reach the highest levels 
during the quarter ended december  the company generally builds inventory levels in preparation for the upcoming selling season which begins with boat and recreation shows occurring during january through march in certain market areas in which the company conducts business 
travis boats operating results would be materially and adversely affected if net sales were to fall significantly below historical levels during the months of january through june 
the company s business is also significantly affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions that are unseasonable or unusual may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels  as well as excessive rain  may affect the company s sale of boating packages and related products and accessories 
see risk factors we depend on strong sales in the first half of the year and our sales depend on good weather 
quarterly results may fluctuate due to many factors 
some of these factors include  weather conditions  timing of special events such as boat shows  availability of product and the opening or closing of store locations 
accordingly  the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of the expected results for any other quarterly period 
the results for the quarter ended september  were negatively impacted by certain events including the expenses related to the closing of two store locations and the establishment of reserve allowances on certain inventories and accounts receivable 
management estimates the expenses associated with these to be approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including inventory requirements  off season liquidity and store infrastructure 
these short term cash needs have historically been financed with cash from operations and further supplemented by borrowings under the company s floor plan and revolving credit lines collectively the borrowing agreements 
at september   the company had approximately million in cash  million in accounts receivable primarily contracts in transit from sales  manufacturer rebates receivable and other amounts due from manufacturers and million in inventories 
contracts in transit are amounts receivable from a customer or a customer s financial institution related to that customer s purchase of a boat 
these asset balances were offset by approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million outstanding under its borrowing agreements and million in short term indebtedness including current maturities of notes payable 
included within the current maturities of notes payable are balloon payments due pursuant to the terms of two real estate loans  with one payment of approximately  due in december  and one payment of  due in january  as of september  and december   the aggregate maximum borrowing limits under its borrowing agreements was million and million  respectively see subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
at september  the company had working capital of approximately million 
working capital  as of september   was reduced by the company s net loss and the aforementioned balloon payments of approximately million  which pending the refinances thereof are classified as a current liability 
in fiscal  operating activities provided cash flows of million due primarily to the decrease of million in inventories as a result of the company s inventory reduction strategies and net increases in accounts payable and the collection of the income taxes recoverable 
these amounts were offset partially by the net loss of million  decreases in accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses 
in fiscal  operating activities utilized cash flows of million due primarily to an increase of million and million in inventories and income taxes payable  respectively 
these amounts were offset partially by net income of  investing activities utilized cash flows of million due primarily to the purchase and replacement of assets used in operations of the store locations 
these activities were primarily funded through the company s borrowing agreements and internal cash flows 
financing activities in fiscal utilized cash flows of million primarily from the repayment of amounts outstanding under the company s borrowing agreements 
these repayments were generally from the proceeds of the company s net reduction in overall inventory levels during the period 
the company finances substantially all of its inventory and working capital requirements pursuant to borrowing agreements entered into in january with two commercial finance companies transamerica distribution finance tdf and deutsche financial services dfs 
the agreements  which have maturity dates of january  contain substantially similar terms and financial ratio based covenant requirements 
the maximum aggregate borrowing availability as of september  was limited to a maximum credit limit of million at various sub prime based or libor based interest rates varying from to at september  
borrowings under the agreements are pursuant to a borrowing base formula and are used primarily to finance inventory purchases and for general working capital requirements 
substantially all inventory  accounts receivable and intangible assets collateralize these borrowing agreements 
the terms of the borrowing agreements also provide for i fees for administrative monitoring  ii fees for unused portions of available credit  and iii pre payment fees in the event of the company s termination of such floor plans prior to their stated maturity dates in january the borrowing agreements also include restrictive loan agreements containing various loan covenants and borrowing restrictions  including minimum financial ratios governing net worth  current assets  debt to worth percentages and cash flow coverage requirements based upon interest expense and monthly principal and interest payments on debts 
acquisitions  the payment of dividends or repurchases of the company s common stock are also substantially limited without prior consent 
as of september   the company was in violation of several financial ratio covenants 
however  the company has entered into amended loan agreements with both lenders dated as of december  concurrent with execution of the amended loan agreements  the company received waivers on all financial covenants that were then in non compliance with the prior agreements 
the amended loan agreements also provide for certain revisions to i future financial ratio s and ii the maximum amount which the company may borrow from the initial amount of million to varying reduced amounts through july of when such maximum amount will be established at million until the expiration of the borrowing agreements in january of see subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
effective december  the company entered into subordinated convertible loan transactions in the aggregate amount of  the loans are unsecured with a term of months and have rates ranging from prime  adjusted quarterly  to  fixed 
the principal and interest amounts payable pursuant to the loans is subordinated  in substantially all respects  to the company s borrowing agreements with tdf and dfs providing inventory and working capital financing for the company 
the loans are redeemable by the company  and if not redeemed may be converted by the holders into the company s common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share see subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
based upon management s fiscal operating plan  including the sale leaseback or refinancing of certain assets  if necessary  and availability under the borrowing agreements  the company believes that there is adequate liquidity to fund the company s operations and to make required principal payments under the two borrowing agreements and other outstanding debt 
however  material shortfalls or variances from anticipated performance could require the company to seek further amendment to the amended borrowing agreements or alternate sources of financing 
management believes the company to be in compliance with all other terms and conditions of its loan agreements and all proposed terms and conditions established pursuant to the aforementioned waivers of financial covenants 
as of december   million was drawn on the borrowing agreements and the company could borrow i zero for general working capital purposes  and ii an additional million solely for additional inventories 
as the company purchases inventory  the amount purchased increases the borrowing base availability and typically the company makes a determination to borrow 
various manufacturers provide the company interest expense assistance under the borrowing agreements in order to subsidize the carrying cost of inventory 
accordingly  no interest expense is recorded during portions of the year generally august through may for certain borrowings under these arrangements 
at september  and  the company had non interest bearing borrowings of  and  under these arrangements 
discontinuance of these agreements could result in an increase to interest expense 
see risk factors we rely on two key manufacturers for almost all of our outboard motor purchases and one of the manufacturers has filed for voluntary bankruptcy under chapter 
merchandise inventories were million and million as of september  and  respectively 
accounts receivable  on a net basis  decreased by approximately  to million at the end of fiscal from a year earlier 
costs in excess of net assets acquired decreased by approximately  to million in fiscal due to the scheduled amortization of this asset 
the company had capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal were primarily used for the purchase and replacement of assets used in operations of the store locations 
capital expenditures in the prior fiscal year included expenditures related to the renovation of several facilities to the company s superstore standards and expenditures related to the roll out of the company s management information systems in certain store locations 
the company also acquired real estate in san antonio  texas  key largo  florida  clearwater  florida and completed the construction of a new superstores in atlanta  georgia and san antonio  texas 
these capital expenditures were funded through the company s borrowing agreements  mortgage debt and internal cash flows 
the company s borrowing agreements and internally generated working capital should be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements in the near future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   approximately of the company s notes payable and other short term obligations bear interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as the prime rate of interest of certain banks 
during the fiscal year ended september   the average rate of interest of such variable rates was 
increases in the variable interest rates result in increased interest expense and decreased earnings and cashflow 
assuming the same level of borrowings for the year ended september   which averaged approximately  an increase of in the average rate of interest would result in an increase in fiscal interest expense of approximately  and an increase in fiscal net loss and after tax cashflow of approximately  similarly  a decrease in the average rate of interest would result in a decrease in interest expense and an increase in net income and after tax cashflow
