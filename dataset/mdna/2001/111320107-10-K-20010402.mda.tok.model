item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
in this report  all share numbers and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our for stock splits  each in the form of a stock dividend  effective february  and february   respectively 
overview we are the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice  video and data services 
using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  we design  develop and supply system on a chip solutions for applications in digital cable set top boxes and cable modems  high speed local  metropolitan and wide area and optical networks  home networking  voip  carrier access  residential broadband gateways  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast  xdsl  wireless communications  systemi o tm server solutions and network processing 
from our inception in through  we were primarily engaged in product development and the establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships 
during that period  we generated the majority of our revenue from development work performed for key customers 
we began shipping our products in  and subsequently our revenue has grown predominately through sales of our semiconductor products 
we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers  but expect that development revenue will constitute a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
we also generate a small percentage of our product revenue from the sale of software and the provision of software support services and sales of system level reference designs 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  except for shipments to stocking distributors whereby revenue is recognized upon sale to the end customer 
provision is concurrently made for estimated product returns  which historically have been immaterial 
our products typically carry a one year warranty 
development revenue is generally recognized under the percentage of completion method 
revenue from licensed software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided that the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from post contract customer support and any other future deliverables is deferred and earned over the support period or as contract elements are delivered 
we also recognize as a reduction of gross revenue the fair value of assumed performance based warrants earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements 
the percentage of our net revenue derived from independent customers located outside of the united states was approximately in and in both and all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  our key customers have placed large orders causing our quarterly revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue in the future 
sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for and in the future 
our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  competitive pricing strategies  the mix of product revenue and development revenue  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  stock based compensation  and the fair value of performance based warrants earned by certain customers 
for example  newly introduced products generally have higher average selling prices and gross margins  both of which typically decline over product life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume pricing agreements 
our gross margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from three to six months or more  with an additional three to six months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding revenue  if any 
furthermore  during and thereafter  we may continue to increase our investment in research and development  selling  general and administrative functions and inventory as we expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time  and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
during we completed eight acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions  for aggregate consideration of billion 
these acquisitions included innovent systems  inc  a developer of radio frequency integrated circuits for wireless data communications  puyallup integrated circuit company  inc  a provider of integrated circuit design services  including full chip designs and embedded macro blocks for microprocessors  system on a chip and asic designs  altima communications  inc  a supplier of networking integrated circuits for the small to medium sized business networking market  newport communications  inc  a supplier of mixed signal integrated circuits for the high speed communications infrastructure market  silicon spice inc  a developer of communications processors and other technology for high density voice  fax and data packet transmission over wide area networks  element  inc  a developer of high port density  low power digital subscriber line chipsets  software and communications processor technology  allayer communications  a developer of high performance enterprise and optical networking communications chips  and sibyte  inc  a developer of high performance microprocessor solutions for broadband networking 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies incurred after their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we completed nine pooling of interests transactions in and in we completed the acquisitions of digital furnace corporation  a developer of communications algorithms and software that increase the capacity of existing broadband networks for interactive services  bluesteel networks  inc  a developer of high performance internet security processors for e commerce and vpn applications  stellar semiconductor  inc  a developer of d graphics technology  and pivotal technologies corporation  a developer of high performance communications links for both wired and wireless environments 
in we completed the acquisitions of maverick networks  a developer of highly integrated silicon for multi layer switching equipment in enterprise networks  epigram  inc  a developer of advanced semiconductor products for high speed home networking  armedia  inc  a developer of high performance digital video decoders  hothaus technologies inc  a provider of openvoip tm embedded communications software that enables transmission of digital voice  fax and data packets over data networks  including the internet  and altocom  inc  a provider of complete software data fax modem implementations for general purpose embedded processors  pc cpus and digital signal processors 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction  our historical consolidated financial statements and the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for prior periods have been restated to include the operations of these nine companies as if they had been combined with our company at the beginning of the first period presented 
included in revenue and net loss for were revenue and net losses from the four pooling of interests transactions completed in that year and incurred prior to the respective closings of those transactions  aggregating million and million  respectively 
included in restated revenue and net income for were revenue and net losses incurred prior to the respective closings of the nine pooling of interests transactions  aggregating million and million  respectively 
during the course of negotiating the acquisitions of altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte  we challenged each company s management to substantiate its assertions regarding the value and market acceptance of the company s technologies and products by securing significant purchase and development commitments from key or strategic industry customers 
we presented these companies with the concept of issuing performance based warrants to obtain long term commitments from customers 
the companies were able to secure such commitments from several significant customers 
the agreements negotiated by the acquired companies required their customers to purchase minimum quantities of the respective company s products on a quarterly basis during the term or required payments for development services in accordance with a specified schedule  contained substantial cash penalties if the customers failed to purchase the contractually specified minimum levels of product or to fulfill their obligations under the development agreements  and required the acquired companies to issue performance based warrants to purchase the company s stock to the customers  which warrants would vest only if and to the extent the minimum purchase provisions of the purchase agreements and obligations under the development agreements were met 
at the time the warrants were issued  we were under no obligation to purchase the respective companies  but the companies and their customers were obligated to fulfill their contractual commitments under the purchase and development agreements and the warrants 
with these customer relationships and agreements in place  each of the acquired companies  in our assessment  had a higher value than it had prior to entering into the agreements 
because the performance based warrants would be assumed by us if an acquisition were to occur  we provided technical assistance and advice to each company s management to assure that the performance based warrants would be structured to qualify for fixed accounting under emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf 
in allocating the purchase price for altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte  no value has been assigned to the purchase and development agreements because they were executory contracts and their terms were at fair value 
however  pursuant to the provisions of eitf  the related warrants have been assigned fixed values of approximately   and per share  respectively  the warrant fair values determined using the black scholes pricing model at the respective dates that we acquired altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte 
under eitf  a performance based warrant is accounted for using its value at its date of issuance if a significant disincentive to the customer exists that makes the customer s performance probable fixed accounting 
at the time we assumed the warrants and related purchase and development agreements  we determined  in consultation with our independent auditors  that fixed accounting  with the date of acquisition as the valuation measurement date  was required 
with respect to the purchase agreements  this determination was based on the fact that the customers are subject to substantial penalties  which include cash penalties if there are shortfalls in meeting the minimum purchase requirements on a periodic basis throughout the term of the agreements and in some cases further cash penalties payable at the end of the agreements if aggregate purchase commitments are not met 
with respect to the development agreements  this determination was based on the fact that the customers are subject to substantial cash penalties if the customers fail to fulfill their obligations 
in our evaluation  we considered the significance of the cash penalties in relation to both the amounts in each purchase and development agreement and the financial statements of the customers  the effect of forfeiture of the value of the warrants  and the intent and ability of customers to purchase the required products and development services under the agreements 
these warrants will be accounted for in our financial statements pursuant to eitf topic d  grantor balance sheet presentation of unvested  forfeitable equity instruments granted to a nonemployee eitf d 
eitf d announces an sec staff position that an issuer of a performance based warrant should treat it as unissued for accounting purposes until the issuer has received benefit and the warrant vests 
accordingly  the warrants assumed in the altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte acquisitions will be recorded as a reduction of revenue  in the amounts of   and per share  respectively  only as and to the extent any warrants are earned and vest in future periods 
the warrants generally vest quarterly over the period from october through july  subject to satisfaction by customers of the applicable purchase and development requirements  and are generally exercisable for one year after the vesting date at a weighted average exercise price per share of approximately 
the effect of the warrants will be included in our calculation of basic and diluted earnings loss per share as of the beginning of the period in which they are earned by the customers 
during the twelve months ended december   certain customers earned performance based warrants to purchase  shares of our class a common stock  with an aggregate fair value of million 
we and the managements of altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte viewed the purchase and development agreements and related warrants as a means of solidifying each of the acquired company s relationships with key customers 
in addition  the purchase and development agreements allowed us to gain confidence in the acceptance of each of the companies products by such key customers 
at the time we acquired altima  silicon spice  allayer and sibyte  we expected these companies and their customers to perform under the purchase and development agreements and for the assumed warrants to be earned 
however  on february  one of the five customers that had entered into a purchase agreement with altima gave notice to us that it was terminating its purchase agreement 
additionally  based on the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we have concluded that certain of the remaining purchase and development agreements may no longer be desirable 
therefore  we have terminated or are in the process of negotiating termination of certain of these purchase and development agreements and have cancelled or are in the process of negotiating cancellation of the related warrants 
in addition  we may in the future consider revising or terminating any of the remaining purchase and development agreements  which could result in cancellation of the related warrants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for any warrants earned in prior periods will not be affected by such terminations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  gross revenue less fair value of warrants earned by customers net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expense research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of goodwill amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development merger related costs litigation settlement costs income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and revenue 
gross revenue consists of product revenue generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products  and to a lesser extent  from the sales of software and the provision of software support services and development revenue generated under development contracts with our customers 
net revenue represents gross revenue less the fair value of performance based warrants earned by customers 
gross revenue for was billion  an increase of million or as compared with gross revenue of million in gross revenue for was reduced by million representing the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements 
net revenue for was billion  an increase of million or as compared with net revenue of million in the growth in revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems 
in the future  net revenue may be reduced by the effect of the fair value of outstanding performance based warrants earned by certain customers 
also  due to the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we are not currently able to assess the likely trend of revenue in future periods 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and quality assurance for those products  amortization of purchased technology and costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and contracted development work 
gross profit for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of net revenue in the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the volume of semiconductor product shipments 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by volume pricing agreements and competitive pricing strategies on certain high volume products 
included in cost of revenue were approximately million and million of stock based compensation in and  respectively  and approximately million of amortization of purchased intangible assets in we expect that gross profit as a percentage of net revenue will continue to decline in future periods as volume pricing agreements and competitive pricing strategies continue to take effect  which decline may be mitigated to some extent by lower anticipated silicon wafer costs 
in addition  our gross margin may be affected by the future introduction of certain lower margin products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  and subcontracting costs 
research and development expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of net revenue in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
based upon our experience in  we would anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars would continue to increase for the foreseeable future as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities and our expansion into new markets and technologies 
however  due to the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we are not currently able to assess the likely trend of research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  professional fees  trade show expenses and facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of net revenue in the increase in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing personnel  senior management and administrative personnel  increased facilities expenses and legal and other professional fees 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflected the significant increase in revenue during as compared with based upon our experience in  we would expect that selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars would continue to increase for the foreseeable future to support the planned continued expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions  as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support increased headcount  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations  and in view of the volume of current litigation 
however  due to the recent significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and current market conditions  we are not currently able to assess the likely trend of selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation 
we recorded approximately billion and million of deferred compensation in and  respectively  primarily in connection with stock options assumed in our acquisitions 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the fair value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of the stock options at the date of grant 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options  generally three to four years 
stock based compensation expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million  as compared with stock based compensation expense of million or of net revenue in approximately million and million of additional stock based compensation in and was classified as merger related costs 
in addition  approximately million and million of stock based compensation has been classified as cost of revenue in and  respectively 
the significant increase in stock based compensation in relates primarily to stock options assumed in the eight purchase transactions completed during the year that were accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to incur additional stock based compensation expense in future periods as a result of the continued amortization of deferred compensation related to these purchase transactions and additional purchase transactions consummated during the first quarter of in connection with the acquisitions of allayer and sibyte  if certain future performance goals are satisfied  the consideration for these acquisitions will be increased 
any additional consideration paid that is allocated to deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the underlying options and restricted stock assumed in the acquisitions 
in addition  outstanding options assumed in these transactions are subject to variable accounting and will be periodically revalued over the vesting period until all performance goals are satisfied 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
in connection with the eight purchase transactions completed during  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we obtained independent appraisals of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in order to allocate the purchase price 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the economic lives of the respective assets  generally three to five years 
the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets for was million or of net revenue 
no comparable amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets was incurred in in addition  approximately million of amortization of purchased intangible assets has been classified as cost of revenue in in connection with the acquisitions of allayer and sibyte  if certain future performance goals are satisfied  the consideration for these transactions will be increased 
any additional consideration paid that is allocated to goodwill for these acquisitions will be amortized over the remaining respective useful lives 
we expect to incur additional amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in future periods as a result of these purchase transactions and will incur additional goodwill and purchased intangible assets as a result of the purchase transactions consummated during the first quarter of see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
in process research and development ipr d aggregated million for the purchase transactions completed in no amounts of ipr d were incurred in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
we expect to incur additional ipr d in the future as a result of the additional purchase transactions consummated during the first quarter of the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance upon core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based upon forecasted revenues and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charge includes only the fair value of ipr d performed to date 
the fair value of completed technology is included in identifiable intangible assets  and the fair values of ipr d to be completed and future research and development are included in goodwill 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects 
as of the closing date of each purchase transaction  development projects were in process 
although the costs to bring the products from the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition  the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations for our significant purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal average estimated risk average estimated cost to adjusted purchase percent time to complete discount ipr d transaction development projects complete complete in millions rate in millions innovent rf integrated circuits for wireless years altima ethernet physical layer transceivers year newport integrated circuits for optical communications year equipment silicon spice communications processors year element integrated circuits used in dsl year allayer integrated circuits for wide area and ethernet switching applications years sibyte network processors years actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the above acquisitions 
the assumptions primarily consist of expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
shipment volumes of products from the above acquired technologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present time 
it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology life cycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may potentially result in impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
merger related costs 
merger related costs consist primarily of transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other related fees and expenses  and certain restructuring costs related to the disposal of duplicative facilities and assets and the write down of unutilized assets 
merger related costs of approximately million and million were incurred in and  respectively  in connection with the pooling of interests transactions 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs consist primarily of settlement fees and associated attorneys fees  expenses and court costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  less interest on our debt and capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net  for was million as compared with million in this increase was principally due to increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the cash generated by operations  cash balances assumed in acquisitions  and cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the primary differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted from the effects of nondeductible ipr d and acquisition related expenses from the eight purchase transactions completed during our effective tax rate on income before the effects of these items  and before the effects of payroll tax expenses relating to certain stock option exercises  was for and for the primary reasons for our decreased effective tax rate on income before such items for compared to were benefits from increased research and development credits and beneficial tax rate differentials on foreign earnings 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and we provided a valuation allowance of million against a portion of certain acquired net operating losses  due to uncertainty regarding their future realization 
the utilization of such losses is subject to stringent limitations under the internal revenue code 
there is no valuation allowance provided against the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
the primary basis for this conclusion is the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for was million  an increase of million or as compared with revenue of million in the growth in revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of revenue in the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the volume of semiconductor product shipments 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was driven by cost reductions from our suppliers as well as lower than expected rates of price erosion in our major markets 
included in cost of revenue is approximately million of stock based compensation in both and research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue reflected the significant increase in revenue during as compared with selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing personnel  senior management and administrative personnel  and increased occupancy  legal and other professional fees  including increased expenses for litigation 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflected the significant increase in revenue during as compared with stock based compensation 
we recorded approximately million and million of deferred compensation in and  respectively 
of these amounts  the entire amount in and approximately million in represent deferred compensation related to the grant of stock options to certain employees of acquired companies 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
we have presented these amounts as a reduction of shareholders equity and are amortizing these amounts ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options 
stock based compensation aggregated million in and million in approximately million of additional stock based compensation in was classified as merger related costs 
in addition  approximately million of stock based compensation has been classified as cost of revenue in both and merger related costs 
merger related costs of approximately million in were incurred in connection with the acquisitions of maverick  epigram  armedia  hothaus and altocom 
no comparable merger related costs were incurred in litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs consist primarily of settlement fees and associated attorneys fees  expenses and court costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  for was million as compared with million in this increase was principally due to increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the consummation of our initial public offering and sale of shares to cisco systems  inc in april  a follow on offering in october  and cash generated by operations 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
our effective tax rate was reduced by tax benefits associated with research and development credits 
our effective tax rate was increased by our inability to recognize the tax benefits of the net operating losses incurred by epigram  armedia and hothaus during at december  and we provided a valuation allowance of million against a portion of certain acquired net operating losses  due to uncertainty regarding their future realization 
the utilization of such losses is subject to stringent limitations under the internal revenue code 
there is no valuation allowance provided against the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
the primary basis for this conclusion is the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
statement no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are required to and will adopt statement in the first quarter of we do not expect the initial adoption of statement to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we believe that our current revenue recognition policies comply with sab liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and million in long term investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million at the end of to million at the end of during  operating activities provided million in cash 
the net loss of million in was more than offset by the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization  the fair value of warrants earned by customers  stock based compensation  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  ipr d  and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
operating activities provided cash of million in and million in investing activities provided cash in the amount of million in  as a result of million of net cash received from purchase acquisitions and million net proceeds from the sale of investments  partially offset by the purchase of million in minority investments and the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
investing activities used cash of million in for the net purchase of held to maturity investments  the purchase of minority investments and the purchase of capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of capital equipment and the net purchase of held to maturity investments 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which primarily was the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock  partially offset by million in payments on debt obligations of acquired companies 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds from issuances of common stock  partially offset by million in payments on debt obligations of acquired companies 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily the result of million in aggregate net proceeds from our initial public offering and sale of class a common stock to cisco systems in april  million in net proceeds from our follow on offering in october and million in net proceeds from other issuances of common stock 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our shareholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we had outstanding capital commitments totaling approximately million as of december   primarily for the purchase of engineering design tools  computer hardware and information systems infrastructure 
during we spent approximately million on capital equipment to support our expanding operations 
we expect that we will continue to spend substantial amounts during to purchase additional engineering design tools  computer hardware  test equipment  information systems and leasehold improvements  as our operations continue to expand and as we integrate and upgrade the capital equipment and facilities of acquired companies 
we may finance these purchases from our cash and cash equivalents and investments on hand  cash generated from our operations  borrowings  equity offerings  or a combination thereof 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current economic slowdown 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
business combinations on january  we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of visiontech ltd 
and on january  we completed the acquisition of serverworks corporation 
these acquisitions will be accounted for as purchase transactions 
we will record a one time charge for ipr d related to these acquisitions in the fiscal year ending december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the recent slowdown in the us economy 
concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending have resulted in a recent downturn in the us economy 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  we have recently experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders 
if the economic conditions in the us worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results may vary significantly due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid technological change 
from time to time  including during the first quarter of  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity 
the current downturn and future downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of this industry to fully recover from its recent downturn  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products in future periods 
accordingly  our quarterly results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of a key customer  economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current economic slowdown  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  silicon wafer pricing and the availability of foundry and assembly capacity and raw materials  the risks inherent in our acquisitions of technologies and businesses  including the timing and successful completion of technology and product development through volume production  integration issues  costs and unanticipated expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  potential contractual  intellectual property or employment issues  accounting treatment and charges  and the risks that the acquisition cannot be completed successfully or that anticipated benefits are not realized  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the timing of customer industry qualification and certification of our products and the risks of non qualification or non certification  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt broadcom technologies in our target markets  the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our target markets  the effects of new and emerging technologies  intellectual property disputes and customer indemnification claims  the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third party semiconductor foundries and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  the risks of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  the risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations  problems or delays that we may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design integration  our ability to retain and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the numbers  with the capabilities  and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  changes in our product or customer mix  the quality of our products and any remediation costs  the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our control  the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal quarter  and general economic and market conditions 
we expect to continue to increase our operating expenses in the future 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of a key customer could seriously harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to motorola  com and cisco systems  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our net revenue in the year ended december  sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  decreased to of our net revenue in compared to in the year ended december  we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for and in the future 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty 
our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decision to purchase our products 
our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products 
some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
in addition  in order to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face intense competition in the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase in the future as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits in the markets for digital cable set top boxes  cable modems  high speed local  metropolitan and wide area and optical networks  home networking  voice over internet protocol  carrier access  residential broadband gateways  direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast  digital subscriber lines  wireless communications  systemi o server solutions and network processing 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies in the future that more effectively address the transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures or through new digital infrastructures at lower costs than our technologies 
increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition strategy may require us to undertake significant capital infusions  be dilutive to our existing shareholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and january   we acquired companies  including serverworks corporation and visiontech ltd  which acquisitions were completed in january we plan to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired company 
we may also encounter delays in the timing and successful completion of the acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  costs and unanticipated expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
in addition  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with our prior acquisitions  we recorded goodwill in the aggregate amount of billion 
the portion of such goodwill attributable to each acquisition generally will be amortized over a month period from the date that such acquisition closed 
in addition  in connection with our prior acquisitions we incurred deferred compensation charges in the aggregate amount of billion  which will be amortized over the period of time for which the relevant options or restricted stock may continue to vest 
we anticipate recording additional goodwill and deferred compensation charges in connection with future acquisitions 
we may seek to account for acquisitions under the pooling of interests accounting method  but that method may not be available 
any of these events could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition  as in the case of our recent acquisitions  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the pooling of interests rules  the securities issued in nine of the completed acquisitions described above were shares of class b common stock  which has voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions 
in the future  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms 
moreover  it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  products  technologies or personnel  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets in order to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands 
substantially all of our product revenue in recent fiscal quarters has been derived from sales of products for the cable modem  digital cable set top box and high speed office network markets 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
in addition  these markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these markets or other broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
the broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the timeframes that we anticipate 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets  our products could become obsolete and we could lose market share 
products for broadband communications applications generally are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
our inability to anticipate the evolving standards in the semiconductor industry and  in particular the broadband communications markets  or to develop and introduce new products successfully into these markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new silicon solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our quarterly results in the past have been  and are expected in the future to continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and our customers products into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity  achieve high manufacturing yields  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our new products generally are incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we have often incurred significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
the value of our products largely depends on the commercial success of our customers products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins 
in addition  the equipment that incorporates our products may never become commercially successful 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain of our customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied on our strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on two independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to obtain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
two outside foundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  in taiwan and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  or chartered  in singapore  manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
in september tsmc s principal facility was affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  tsmc suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired tsmc s wafer deliveries which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
in addition  if either tsmc or chartered experiences financial difficulties  if either foundry suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries would need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
if we choose to use a new foundry or process  it would typically take us several months to qualify the new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including a lack of ensured wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to certain of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with either tsmc or chartered 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders  and tsmc and chartered can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with tsmc or chartered  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
such a reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we primarily use two independent foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at any given time and some of our products may be designed to be manufactured at only one 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
any of these delays would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries would be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields 
furthermore  our foundries may not be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
certain of our acquired companies have established relationships with foundries other than tsmc and chartered  and we are using these other foundries to produce the initial products of these acquired companies 
we may utilize such foundries for other products in the future 
in using these new foundries  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to tsmc and chartered 
we may be unable to retain key technical and senior management personnel and attract additional key employees  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  in particular  our co founder  president and chief executive officer  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  and our co founder  vice president of research development and chief technical officer  dr 
henry samueli 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives or any other key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of dr 
nicholas or dr 
samueli  or certain other key employees  would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly digital circuit designers  mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to manage our significant recent and anticipated future growth could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
during the past year  we have continued to significantly increase the scope of our operations and expand our workforce  growing from  employees as of december  to  employees as of december   including contract and temporary employees and employees who joined us as the result of acquisitions 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth of operations is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the ongoing improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems 
we also will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
in the future  we will likely need to expand our facilities or relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support our growth 
these relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage expanding operations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of any of the four third party subcontractors that assemble and test substantially all of our current products could disrupt our shipments  harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
four third party subcontractors  asat ltd 
in hong kong  st assembly test services  or stats  in singapore  siliconware precision industries ltd  or spil  in taiwan and amkor technology in the philippines and south korea  assemble and test almost all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance and control 
this lack of control has in the past resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  if any subcontractor suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
in using these new subcontractors  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraph with respect to asat  stats  spil and amkor 
as our international business expands  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside of the united states 
in addition  approximately of our net revenue in the year ended december  was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in we established an international distribution center in singapore and a design center in the netherlands 
furthermore  as a result of our acquisitions of armedia  hothaus  altima  element and visiontech  we also currently undertake design and development activities in india  canada  taiwan  the united kingdom  belgium and israel 
in the future  we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and also to open other design and operational centers abroad 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
various export licensing requirements  the seasonality of international sales or an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to modify our current business practices significantly 
various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have applied for and received several export licenses under these regulations  but we cannot assure you that we will obtain any licenses for which we have currently applied or any licenses that we may apply for in the future 
if we do not receive the required licenses  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain customers located outside the united states 
moreover  the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
any one or more of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or require us to modify our current business practices significantly 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and modify the manufacturing processes for our products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce our costs  and we have begun shifting certain products from 
micron to 
micron  
micron and smaller geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that certain of our competitors or other parties may obtain  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we currently hold issued united states patents and have filed over united states patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  then our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
moreover  because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our technology and patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on the adopted standards 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and do not correct this failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
in the future  we may have to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation may be very expensive and time consuming  divert management s attention and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties and seriously harm our operating results 
companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
in january microtune  lp  an affiliate of microtune  inc  filed a lawsuit against us alleging infringement of a single patent relating to tuner technology 
in august intel filed a lawsuit against us alleging infringement of five intel patents 
in november we settled litigation with intel corporation and its subsidiary level one communications  inc regarding the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets  unfair competition and tortious interference with existing contractual relations related to our hiring of three former intel employees 
in we settled litigation with stanford telecommunications  inc that related to the alleged infringement of one of stanford s patents by several of our cable modem products 
in we prevailed in litigation with sarnoff corporation and nxtwave communications  inc  formerly sarnoff digital communications  inc  which alleged that we misappropriated and misused certain of their trade secrets in connection with our hiring of five former sarnoff employees 
in january our subsidiary  altocom  settled patent litigation with motorola  inc relating to software modem technology 
our subsidiary  altima  is the defendant in patent litigation and international trade commission proceedings brought by intel and level one 
although we are defending the pending litigation vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one of our patents 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue an injunction against us that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology 
we may also have to indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory which could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  our customer will often test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customer may need three to six months or longer to test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and our investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenues for these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenues from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that such customer will ultimately market and sell their equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenues for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  any significant cancellations or deferrals could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
any significant cancellations or deferrals could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
in order to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
our california facilities and the facilities of one of the two independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  tsmc  one of the two outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices  is located in taiwan  a country that is also subject to earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in taiwan could materially disrupt tsmc s production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
as a result  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of our products 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
certain of our directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of january  our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
in particular  as of january  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii and dr 
henry samueli  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting control held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of a majority of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these insiders currently also control the management of our business 
because of their significant stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these shareholders 
these transactions include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our class a common stock that could give our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for their shares than the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since august  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation  and as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings we have recently been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits  which we anticipate will be consolidated 
we and our directors have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions 
although we believe that the lawsuits lack merit  an adverse determination could have a very significant effect upon our business and materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect the price of our stock 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the existence of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock may prevent parties from acquiring us 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock 
finally  these factors may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
debt securities are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
our investment policy for held to maturity investments requires that all investments mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than one year 
primarily  these investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal notional amounts by expected maturity at december  fair value total in thousands  except interest rates cash equivalents    weighted average rate investments     weighted average rate total portfolio     weighted average rate equity securities are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
included in our portfolio is an equity investment in one of our significant customers  a publicly traded company 
as a result of recent market price volatility  we recorded a million unrealized loss in related to this investment 
as of december  the fair value of this publicly traded equity investment was million 
we have also invested in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage  or in funds that invest in such companies 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants in order to establish important strategic relationships  expand existing relationships and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as such  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
as of december   the fair value of these investments was million
