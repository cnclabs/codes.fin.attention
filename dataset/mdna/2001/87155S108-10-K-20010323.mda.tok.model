overview symyx was founded in september and began significant operations in april to date  our revenues and cash flows from operations have come from research collaborations with large chemical  life science and electronics companies  license of proprietary materials  sale and license of instruments and software  and government grants 
our partners and customers include abb lumus global  applied biosystems  basf ag  bayer ag  celanese ltd  the dow chemical company  eveready  exxonmobil  girsa  ici  instituto mexicano del petroleo  unilever uk central resources ltd 
and a number of undisclosed partners 
we expect that our cash flows and revenue for will be comprised in large part of payments to be made and revenue to be earned under these and new agreements together with product and license revenue particularly from our discovery tools business 
we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation and informatics necessary to pursue high throughput discovery for proprietary materials 
these materials include polymers  phosphors and catalysts for life science applications  catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  and new materials for electronic applications 
these investments contributed to revenue increases from million in to million in to million in operating expenses increased from million in to million in to million in our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development  including the development of new instruments and software  to enhance our technologies 
in addition  an important part of our strategy is to expand our operations and employee base  and to build our resources for research and development  business development and marketing 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue from the sale of discovery tools once customer acceptance has been achieved 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as the payments become due 
we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements and government grants as earned upon achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements and grants 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we had deferred revenues of approximately million 
the terms of our collaboration agreements generally require us to perform minimum levels of research 
our sources of potential revenue for the next several years are likely to be payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  government research grants  royalties from our partners based on revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements  sales of discovery tools and other instruments  and sales of any products discovered in our internal research programs

deferred compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  for  million for and  in the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees and consultants in all operating expense categories

results of operations years ended december  and revenues our total revenues increased to million in  up from million in this increase was due primarily to the introduction of our discovery tools business which generated million of revenue in together with a development candidate transfer fee which provided revenue of million in the remainder of the increase in revenue was attributable to the addition of new research collaborations and the expansion of existing government grants 
applied biosystems  bayer  celanese and the dow chemical company accounted for   and of total revenue for the months ended december   and   and of revenue for the same period in revenue from research collaborations was less than research and development expense for the year ended december  due primarily to the research costs associated with internal projects primarily in our proprietary materials business and the development costs associated with our recently initiated discovery tools business 
the excess of revenue over research and development costs during the year ended december  was primarily because we did not incur significant costs in our discovery tools and proprietary materials businesses 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million for the twelve month period ended december  there was no cost of products sold in the twelve month period ended december  the increase in cost of products sold was due directly to the introduction of the discovery tools business  which first resulted in product revenue in the year the company has limited sales of discovery tools systems and consumables to date  and the cost of products sold is expected to fluctuate from period to period and will be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volumes in each period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  depreciation of facilities  and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to increases in salaries and other personnel related costs  facilities costs  collaborative research and consultant costs and chemical and scientific supplies costs to support our additional collaborative and internal research efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation charge 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to revenue increases associated with the addition of significant contracts and the addition of product and license revenues in our core businesses are research to discover new materials and the sale of instruments and related software 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project however  we estimate that approximately of research and development efforts in were undertaken for collaborative projects and approximately of research spending was on our own internally funded research 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in expenses increased primarily due to the addition of a number of business development personnel  increased salaries  consultant and other personnel related costs due to additional staffing necessary to manage and support our growth 
general and administrative expenses also increased due to an increase in travel costs related mainly to business development and sales efforts  an increase in public relations costs associated with being a public company  an increase in insurance and license costs and expenses related to a proposed stock offering which was withdrawn during the three months ended march  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the deferred compensation charge 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we expand our business development and administrative staff  add facilities  and incur additional costs related to being a public company  including directors and officers insurance  investor relations programs and increased professional fees 
net interest income expense net interest income expense represents interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense on equipment financing loans 
interest income increased from million in to million in this increase was due to higher average cash balances 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease was due to a reduction in the outstanding balances of equipment financing loans used to partially fund our acquisition of equipment 
provision for income taxes due to operating losses and the inability to recognize the benefits therefrom  there is no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  if not utilized  the net operating losses and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in the ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit before utilization

bf goodrich accounted for of revenue in our collaboration with bf goodrich was terminated by mutual agreement in april after bf goodrich merged with another company and changed its business focus from chemicals to aerospace 
bf goodrich has returned to us all of the intellectual property that was the subject of the collaboration agreement and has made termination payments through december amounting to  which have been recognized as revenue in revenue from research collaborations exceeded research and development expense for the year ended december  this increase in revenue was primarily due to technology access fees  which are being recognized over the term of the agreements  and higher reimbursement rates under certain collaboration agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs to support our additional collaborative and internal research efforts 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to the addition of significant contracts in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from in to million in expenses increased primarily due to increased staffing necessary to manage and support our growth 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease as a percentage of our total revenues was due primarily to the growth in our total revenues 
net interest income expense interest income increased from million in to million in this increase was due to higher average cash balances 
interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase was due to additional equipment financing loans used to partially fund our acquisition of equipment 
provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and and consequently we did not pay any significant federal  state or foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since  we have financed our operations primarily through net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and  prior to the initial public offering  private placements of preferred stock totaling million  research and development funding from collaborative partners and  to a lesser extent  equipment financing loans 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million available under an equipment financing line of credit 
our operating activities provided million and million of cash in and  respectively 
the sources of cash for and were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners  partially offset by operating expenses 
cash used in our operating activities was million for uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net operating losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities and the purchase of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment were million in  million in and million in we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
financing activities used cash of  in  and provided cash of million in and million in  respectively 
these amounts primarily represent the proceeds we received from our initial public offering in and the sale of preferred stock in  equipment and leasehold improvement loan financings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we will repay loan financings over the next three years as follows million in  million in and  in current assets decreased at december  as compared to december  the decrease was due primarily to a change in the classification of marketable securities between short and long term investments 
at december  more of our portfolio was held as short term investments  whereas at december  we have invested in a greater number of longer term securities to take advantage of the higher interest rates 
this change in the classification of marketable securities has been partially offset by an increase in interest receivable from these investments and an increase in inventories related to discovery tools systems currently being constructed 
deferred revenue decreased at december  as compared to december  this decrease was due to the timing of the receipt of advance payments  including technology access fees  under collaborative research programs 
as of december   we had committed funding from existing collaborative partners  excluding milestone payments which are contingent upon the success of the research  of approximately million 
we also had committed revenue for the sale of discovery tools systems of approximately million 
as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
principal commitments consisted of our obligations under operating leases 
we will satisfy these obligations over the next ten years 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments which have maturities of less than two years 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
at december  our investment portfolio comprised approximately million in money market funds and million in us corporate debt securities 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest
