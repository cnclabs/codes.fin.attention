all dollar amounts in this md a are in millions except per share amounts 
the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total revenues 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenues information storage systems information storage software information storage services total information storage revenue other businesses total revenue cost and expenses cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring  merger and other charges operating income investment income  interest expense and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues total revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to information storage systems revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the increases were primarily due to increased sales volume resulting from the continued strong demand for emc s symmetrix and clariion series of products and the successful introduction of new products within those existing product lines 
included in information storage systems revenues are revenues from enterprise switching products sold directly to third parties by mcdata corporation  formerly a majority owned subsidiary of emc 
these revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
emc distributed all of its interest in mcdata to emc stockholders on a pro rata basis in the form of a dividend effective february  after the distribution  revenues from products sold directly to third parties by mcdata will no longer be included in emc s consolidated results 
information storage software revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the increases were primarily due to increased licenses of information storage software on both newly shipped and already installed systems and the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products 
information storage services revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to the increases were primarily related to increased maintenance revenues on information storage systems and information storage software products and increased revenues from professional services 
total information storage revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and  or  from to other businesses revenues were  and  in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and a decrease of  or  from to other businesses revenues consist of revenues from aviion server products and related services 
the decreases in other businesses revenues were due to refocusing the company s efforts on more profitable lines of business 
emc anticipates further declines in revenues from aviion server products and related services in revenues on sales into the north american markets were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the revenue growth reflects continued strong demand for emc s products and services 
revenues on sales into the markets of europe  the middle east and africa were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to revenues on sales into the markets in the asia pacific region were  and in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to revenues on sales into the markets of latin america were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or  from to the increases in international sales were a result of emc s efforts to expand its sales infrastructure throughout the world to meet the increasing demands for information storage 
international revenues accounted for of total revenues in  compared to in and in emc anticipates that international revenues will continue to account for an increasing percentage of its total sales 
gross margins overall gross margins increased to in  compared to in and in information storage systems and information storage software gross margins increased to in  compared to in and in the increases were primarily attributable to increased licensing of emc s information storage software products  which have higher gross margins than sales of emc s information storage systems 
information storage software revenue  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in and in gross margins were also affected by component cost declines  which were greater than product price declines 
emc currently believes that both component cost and product price declines will continue 
gross margins for information storage services increased to in  compared to in and in the improvements in the gross margin percentages were attributable to greater productivity of emc field personnel in emc s global services organization 
gross margins for other businesses increased to in from in and in the improvements in gross margin percentages reflect emc s efforts to refocus this business on the most profitable products and services 
research and development research and development r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in r d spending from to and to reflects emc s ongoing research and development efforts in a variety of areas  including networked storage products  enhancements to both the symmetrix and clariion families of systems  new information storage software products and fibre channel connectivity 
emc expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for r d in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in spending levels were primarily due to efforts to build an infrastructure to achieve broader customer coverage and greater account depth around the world 
restructuring  merger and other charges during  emc recorded a charge of related to restructuring  merger and other charges primarily related to the acquisition of data general 
the restructuring provided for the consolidation of emc s operations and elimination of duplicative facilities worldwide 
accordingly  during  emc recorded a charge of approximately related to employee termination benefits  facility closure costs  asset disposals and other exit costs which emc has recorded in operating expenses 
the expected cash impact of the charge is approximately  of which was paid in and was paid in the restructuring included an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by approximately  employees  approximately of whom were based in north america and of whom were based in europe 
the employee separations affected the majority of business functions and job classes 
of the approximately  employees identified  approximately were terminated in and were terminated in as part of the charge  emc also recorded a charge for merger costs of for financial advisory services  legal  accounting and other direct expenses related to the data general acquisition  which has been recorded in operating expenses 
in addition  emc recorded a charge related to asset impairments recorded in operating expenses and recorded a charge of for capitalized software and inventory write downs which is included in cost of product sales 
in  emc recorded a charge of related to a restructuring program and certain asset write downs resulting from the program 
the charge included approximately related to employee termination benefits  asset write downs and other exit costs which emc has recorded in operating expenses and approximately for capitalized software and inventory write downs which are included in cost of product sales 
the expected cash impact of the restructuring charge is approximately  of which was paid in  was paid in and was paid in the restructuring program included an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by approximately employees  approximately of whom were based in north america and the remainder of whom were based in europe and the asia pacific region 
the employee separations affected the majority of business functions and job classes 
of the employees identified  approximately were terminated in and were terminated in the amounts accrued and charged against the established provisions described above were as follows beginning current year current year ending balance provision utilization balance employee termination benefits lease abandonments asset disposals other exit costs employee termination benefits lease abandonments asset disposals other exit costs investment income and interest expense investment income increased to in  from in and in investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents and short and long term investments and lease income 
investment income increased in and primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances which were derived from operations and the net proceeds from mcdata s initial public offering 
as a result of the distribution of emc s interest in mcdata to emc stockholders in february  emc anticipates that investment income will grow at a lower rate in interest expense decreased to in from in interest expense decreased to in from in the decrease in from was primarily due to conversions of emc s convertible subordinated notes due in march and emc s convertible subordinated notes due in may the decrease in from was primarily due to conversions of the notes 
other income expense  net other expense was in compared with other income of in and other income of in the increase in other expense in compared to was due to an increase in the losses from the sale of fixed assets and an increase in the minority s interest in the earnings of mcdata 
the increase in other income from to was primarily attributable to gains on the sale of publicly traded securities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was in  in and in  which resulted in effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in   and were lower than the us statutory rate due primarily to emc s global tax strategies and the benefits derived from its offshore manufacturing operations 
the reduction in the rate compared to the rate resulted from the data general acquisition  causing a reduction in the valuation allowance to recognize net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by an increase in the rate due to the non deductibility of certain merger related costs 
emc anticipates that the effective tax rate for will be approximately 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were  and  at december  and  respectively  an increase of  in  cash and cash equivalents increased by and short and long term investments increased by cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in and in the annual increases were primarily due to growth in net income 
cash used for investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
capital additions were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in capital additions resulted from emc s expansion of its infrastructure to meet the increased demands for emc s products 
net purchases of investments were  and in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was  and in  and  respectively 
in  emc generated from the issuance of common stock in the initial public offering of mcdata 
the majority of the remaining cash generated in  and was from the exercise of stock options 
emc has available for use a credit line of and may elect to borrow at any time 
in  of convertible debt was converted into common stock 
based on its current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  emc believes that the combination of funds currently available  funds generated from operations and its available line of credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on emc s financial results 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  subsequently updated by sab a and sab b sab 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
emc adopted sab in the fourth quarter of and there was no material impact on emc s results of operations or financial position 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

and among other issues clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  emc adopted fin in the third quarter of and there was no material impact on emc s results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fas fas 
fas amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for an entity that has adopted fas no 
prior to june   fas is effective for all quarters beginning after june  emc adopted fas in the third quarter of and there was no material impact on emc s results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results emc s prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
emc s future results may differ materially from its current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in emc s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if emc s suppliers do not meet its quality or delivery requirements  emc could have decreased revenues and earnings 
emc purchases many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers  including some of its competitors 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components and power supplies 
emc has experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet its quality and delivery requirements 
if any of its suppliers were to fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for its products  emc could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  emc periodically transitions its product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning its customers smoothly to new technologies  along with its historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet its quality or delivery requirements will have an adverse impact on emc s revenues and earnings 
emc may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry changes 
the markets in which emc competes are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
customer preferences in these markets are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that emc s products will continue to be properly positioned in the market or to receive customer acceptance 
risks associated with the development of new products include delays in development and the modification of the design or configuration of the computers or operating systems with which emc s products are compatible 
risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer demand accurately  the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products  the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced and delays in initial shipments of new products 
further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time 
emc s failure to keep pace with rapid industry changes or to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could adversely effect emc s business and reputation 
the markets emc serves are highly competitive  and emc may be unable to compete effectively 
emc competes with many established companies in the markets it serves and some of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than emc 
emc also competes with many smaller  less established companies in specific product segments 
some of these companies may have earlier access to new technologies  products or business models than emc 
emc s business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by its competitors  including hardware  software and services  and the implementation of effective marketing strategies by its competitors 
competitive pricing could adversely affect emc s revenues and earnings 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer information storage and server markets and have had  and in the future may have  an adverse effect on emc s revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which emc cannot foresee 
emc currently believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
to date  emc has been able to manage its component and product design costs 
however  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on emc s earnings 
changes in foreign conditions could impair emc s international sales 
a substantial portion of emc s revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of emc s products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  emc s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
risks associated with emc s indirect channels of distribution may adversely affect emc s financial results 
emc derives a significant percentage of its product revenues from indirect channels of distribution  including distributors  systems integrators  resellers and oems 
emc s financial results could be adversely affected if its contracts with its indirect channels of distribution were terminated  if emc s relationship with its indirect channels were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of its indirect channels were to weaken 
in addition  as emc s business grows  emc may have an increased reliance on indirect channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels 
if emc is not successful  emc may lose certain sales opportunities 
furthermore  the partial reliance on indirect channels of distribution may materially reduce the visibility to management of potential orders  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such orders 
in addition  there can be no assurance that emc s indirect channels will not develop or market products in competition with emc in the future 
historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact quarterly revenues and earnings 
emc s quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
emc believes this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including the significant size of emc s average product price in relation to its customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences emc s uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
if orders vary substantially from the predicted demand  the ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited  which could adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  emc s revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and its backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because emc assembles its products on the basis of its forecast of near term demand and maintains inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers emc generally ships products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule orders with little or no penalty moreover  delays in product shipping  caused by loss of power or telecommunications or similar services  or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses  could intensify the impact of these factors on emc s business  results of operations and financial condition 
emc may have difficulty sustaining and managing its growth 
emc has a history of rapid growth 
emc s future operating results will depend on its management s ability to manage growth  such as hiring and retaining significant numbers of qualified employees  enhancing and expanding its infrastructure  including but not limited to its information systems and management team  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses  managing its manufacturing capacity and other assets and executing on its plans 
an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
emc s business may suffer if it is unable to attract and retain key personnel 
emc s continued growth depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees  the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in the high technology industry 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in continuously recruiting new personnel or in retaining existing personnel 
the loss of one or more key or other employees or emc s inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
undetected problems in emc s products could directly impair emc s financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of emc s products were to occur by emc or its suppliers  emc could experience a rate of failure in its products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing  are critical factors in the future growth of emc 
there can be no assurance that emc s efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for its products will be sufficient to permit emc to avoid a rate of failure in its products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
emc s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
as part of its business strategy  emc seeks to acquire businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business including  among other things the effect of the acquisition on emc s financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further emc s strategies the difficulty of integrating the acquired business the lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of emc s management s attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company these factors could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
to the extent that emc issues shares of common stock or other rights to purchase common stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing stockholders may experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
emc also seeks to invest in businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business 
emc s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances 
emc has alliances with leading information technology companies and emc plans to continue its strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand its reach into emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that emc will be successful in its ongoing strategic alliances or that emc will be able to find further suitable business relationships as it develops new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on emc s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that companies with which emc has strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than emc  will not develop or market products in competition with emc in the future  discontinue their alliances with emc or form alliances with emc s competitors 
emc s business may suffer if it cannot protect its intellectual property 
emc generally relies upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain emc s proprietary rights in its technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of emc s proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect emc s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to adequately protect its proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect emc s competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that emc will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct its business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
from time to time  emc receives notices from third parties claiming infringement by emc s products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause emc to incur significant expenses 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting emc from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against emc requiring emc to pay royalties to a third party  and emc fails to develop or license a substitute technology  emc s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
emc may become involved in litigation that may adversely affect emc 
in the ordinary course of business  emc may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause emc to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations could adversely affect emc 
emc s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to emc or its products were newly implemented or changed 
emc s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the it market 
emc s revenue growth and profitability depend on the overall demand for information storage hardware  software and services  particularly in the product segments in which emc competes 
a softening of demand for information storage systems  software or services caused by a weakening economy could result in decreased revenues or earnings or lower growth rates 
emc s stock price is volatile 
emc s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by emc or its competitors quarterly variations in its operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community in addition  emc s stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to emc s performance 
because of these factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk emc is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  emc enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to emc s policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  emc is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  emc s primary exposures related to sales denominated in the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
additionally  emc s exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia  has recently increased because of its expanding presence in these markets 
despite the relative size of emc s exposures in these markets  the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact emc s financial results 
emc uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  emc uses these derivative instruments to reduce its foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments emc holds are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
emc uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses a combination of option and forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
the hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  emc could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
emc employs a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for its combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  and million as of december  interest rate risk emc maintains an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
a portion of emc s investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities which are subject to prepayment risk 
emc employs a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for its combined investment portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the investment portfolios was million as of december  and million as of december  credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject emc to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable 
emc places its temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limits the amount of investment with any one financial institution 
the credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas
