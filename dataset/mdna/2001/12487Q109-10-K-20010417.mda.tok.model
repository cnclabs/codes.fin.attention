for the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million in the decline in operating income of million from was principally the result of an increase in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  reflecting a full year of spending of million associated with drivelogic  which was established late in  costs of million associated with the shutdown of international s dw norris outsourcing business in december and million of litigation settlements in related to the settlement cost of an arbitration proceeding with autobody software solutions  inc and a lawsuit settlement with american salvage pool association

ccc us s operating income and margin improved from based on cost reduction efforts over the last two years 
these efforts included  but were not limited to  a reduction in force and the sale of its dealer services business both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of and the relocation of certain claims settlement functions to sioux falls  south dakota in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  ccc us recorded a gain of million related to the final resolution of previously accrued expenses related to a vendor agreement focused on technology testing and roll out of certain products and services 
offsetting these decreases in operating expenses from  were the costs associated with settling two litigation matters totaling million and a charge of million related to the determination that certain prepaid marketing fees paid to a third party related to the ccc us division s shop management products were impaired 
this impairment determination was based on an analysis of projected future revenue and profitability streams of the shop management products associated with this marketing fee 
in addition  certain contractual committed consulting fees and development expenses of million related to this third party were recorded in the third quarter of consumer services revenue declined from primarily as a result of lower access revenues  driven by lower transaction volume with two customers 
however  although operating expenses associated with access declined along with revenue  this was more than offset by a charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of for the abandonment of an internally developed new claims processing management system to be used by internal staff to process claims 
we are currently exploring strategic alternatives for the consumer services segment to reduce the related operating losses of this segment going forward 
ccc international s operating losses were mainly the result of its dw norris outsourcing business acquired in august of dw norris operating losses were million for and accounted for the majority of ccc international s operating losses 
dw norris s results in included total charges of million associated with our decision in december to shutdown the business 
the decision to shutdown the business was the result of continued under performance and expected future losses due to the loss of a significant customer 
drivelogic had significant operating losses reflecting our continued development of new product offerings that will utilize the internet 
this new business unit was formed in late shared services operating expenses for of million increased million from million in  excluding the reduction in force charge of million 
the increase in expenses was primarily related to higher amortization expense related to internal use software costs  mainly those relating to a new customer relationship management system implemented in late and a new human resources and payroll system implemented in further  increased mis costs associated with internal infrastructure and consulting costs associated with the company reviewing strategic alternatives for its consumer services segment contributed to the increase operating expenses 
offsetting these increases  in part  was a one time compensation charge of million recorded in as a result of a stock repurchase from a charitable trust funded by our former chairman  david m 
phillips 
revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  of million were million  or  higher than the same period last year 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in ccc us s revenue of million  or  from its eznet communications network and a reduction in ccc us s accounts receivable allowance reserves in the first quarter of of approximately million 
this adjustment  which was reversed to the same line as the original provisions were recorded  was based on a detailed analysis of exposures and required reserves on an individual account basis of our accounts receivables

production and customer support 
production and customer support decreased from million  or of revenue  to million  or of revenue 
the year over year decrease was due primarily to lower expenses associated with ccc us s automotive services group and claims settlement group 
in addition  consumer services had lower claims processing and support costs 
ccc us s automotive services group decrease was principally due to lower training and implementation fees associated with the pathways digital imaging and pathways enterprise solution products and the sale of the ccc us s dealer services business in december ccc us s claims settlement decrease was primarily due to lower headcount and associated costs due to improved efficiency in the customer support area and lower monthly production costs associated with pathways collision estimating product s monthly updates 
the decrease in consumer services claims processing and support costs  primarily lower headcount and third party services  was mainly driven by revenue declines 
these decreases were offset  in part  by higher operating costs resulting from ccc international s acquisition of dw norris in august of commissions  royalties and licenses 
commission  royalties and licenses decreased from million  or of revenues  to million  or of revenues 
the decrease in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was due mainly to a decrease in commissions resulting from ccc us s conversion of its independent sales representatives for collision repair facilities to salaried employees and the elimination of ccc us s highly commissioned dealer services products as part of the sale of this business in late in the third quarter of  we determined that certain prepaid marketing fees paid to a third party for ccc us s pathways enterprise solution were impaired 
this impairment determination was based on an analysis of projected future revenue and profitability streams of the shop management products associated with this marketing fee 
we recorded a charge of million in connection with the write off of this asset that offset  in part  the decreases in commissions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative increased from million  or of revenues  to million  or of revenues 
of this increase  approximately million  or of the net increase  was due to costs associated with drivelogic 
additional increases were the result of ccc us s conversion of its independent sales representatives for collision repair facilities to salaried employees  consulting of million associated with reviewing strategic alternatives for consumer services and a bad debt provision of million recorded in connection with the decision to shut down ccc international s dw norris business in december these increases were offset  in part  by the impact of a one time compensation charge of million as a result of a stock repurchase from a charitable trust funded by our former chairman  david m 
phillips and lower consulting costs for projects aimed at improving the internal telecommunications and customer service infrastructure incurred in the first half of in addition  ccc us recorded a fourth quarter gain of million related to the final resolution of previously accrued expenses associated with a vendor agreement focused on technology testing and roll out of certain products and services

the dollar and percentage of revenue increases were due primarily to drivelogic s new product development efforts and ccc us s total loss development efforts

restructuring charges 
in december  we decided to shutdown the dw norris outsourcing business due to the significant losses incurred since the acquisition  the continued deterioration of the overall business and the poor long term assessment of the business 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off the goodwill  severance and related costs to terminate approximately employees  write down the fixed assets to net realizable value and contractual commitments 
excluding the restructuring charge  dw norris had a net loss of million in in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a reduction in force charge of million

during the fourth quarter of  we funded of the operating losses of enterstand 
as a result of this funding  we recorded of the losses incurred during this period

we received an aggregate purchase price of million from the sale of these securities 
the proceeds from the sale have been  and will be  used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with ccc trust s issuance of the trust preferred securities and our related purchase of all of the trust s common securities  we issued an increasing rate note due in the principal amount of million  due february  increasing rate note  to the trust 
the sole asset of the trust is the increasing rate note and any interest accrued thereon 
the interest payment dates on the increasing rate note correspond to the distribution dates on the trust preferred securities

we unconditionally guaranteed all of the trust preferred securities to the extent of the assets of ccc trust

our principal liquidity requirements include our operating activities  including product development for ccc us and drivelogic  our investments in internal and customer capital equipment and funding requirements for our choiceparts and enterstand investments 
ccc has the ability to operate with a working capital deficit  as we receive substantial payments from our customers for its services in advance of recognizing the revenues and the costs incurred to provide such services 
ccc invoices each customer a month in advance for the following month s pathways collision estimating software services 
as such  ccc typically receives cash from its customers prior to recognizing the revenue and incurring the expense for the services provided 
these amounts are reflected as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet until these amounts are earned and recognized as revenues 
we have over the past three years been able to fund all of our working capital needs and capital expenditures from cash generated from operations 
management believes that cash flows from operations  its available credit line facility  the funding it received from capricorn and other financing alternatives currently being pursued will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the year ending december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to satisfy our liquidity needs in the future without engaging in financing activities beyond those described above 
certain risks related to our business we may not be able to successfully develop new services  which may adversely affect our business 
the markets in which we compete are increasingly characterized by technological change 
the introduction of competing services incorporating new technologies could render some or all of our services unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends on our ability to enhance our current services and to develop new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
as a result  we have in the past and intend to continue to commit substantial resources to product development and programming 
the development of new products may result in unanticipated expenditures and capital costs which may not be recovered in the event of an unsuccessful product 
our failure to develop and introduce new or enhanced services and products in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing technologies or customer requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to provide collision estimating services to our customers could be severely limited if access to the data supplied by hearst is interrupted 
a substantial portion of the data utilized in our collision estimating products is derived from the motor crash estimating guide  a publication of a subsidiary of the hearst corporation 
we have a license to use the motor crash estimating guide data under an agreement with hearst which expires on april  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the hearst license on economic terms that are beneficial to us or at all 
we do not believe that we have access to an alternative database that would provide comparable information 
any interruption of our access to the motor crash estimating guide data could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding our license with hearst  see item business intellectual property and licenses 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete effectively could be adversely impacted 
we regard the technology underlying our services and products as proprietary 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws  patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered certain of our trademarks 
our total loss calculation process is not patented  however  the underlying methodology and processes are trade secrets and are essential to our total loss business 
existing trade secrets and copyright laws afford us limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the obligations to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information will effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide meaningful protection for our confidential information  or that our trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by our competitors 
there can be no assurance that our trade secrets or proprietary information will provide competitive advantages or will not be challenged or circumvented by its competitors 
we may be required to litigate to defend against claims of infringement  to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of efforts by  us 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently committing a significant amount of capital to drivelogic  which may never be profitable 
we are currently committing a significant amount of capital to our newest segment  drivelogic in the belief that this investment will result in a family of new products that can be used by the insurance claims industry to make the claims process more efficient 
however  development projects can be lengthy and are subject to changing market requirements and unforeseen factors which can result in delays  therefore we can not be certain that drivelogic will develop into a profitable entity 
currently  drivelogic has only one fully operational product  collision repair solution 
this product does not generate revenue at this time and may never do so 
although we believe we are close to marketing several new products that will be favorable received by the insurance industry  we cannot guarantee that these products will ever be operational or be adopted by a large customer base 
therefore  the large amount of capital currently being invested in drivelogic may never show a profitable return 
we are involved in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
we are currently involved in several legal proceedings that may result in substantial payments by the company 
we currently are defendants in class actions suits regarding our total loss product 
if we were to face a full court trial and an unfavorable resolution of these cases  we could incur significant legal and settlement expenses that may have a significant negative impact on our revenue 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
we have a history of operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain  which may impact our ability to continue operations 
we have an accumulated net deficit from inception of approximately million through december  additionally  we failed to generate a profit for the years and  and have seen a persistent decrease in cash flow for the last three years 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in product acquisition and development  from servicing of debt and from general and administrative costs 
these costs have exceeded our revenues in most years  which have been derived primarily from the sale of our total loss product and pathways services 
although we increased our revenue in each of the years ended december   and  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain this growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness or other obligations or find alternative financing sources  our business may be adversely affected 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and other obligations and to fund planned expenditures depends on our ability to generate future cash flow 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds under our million credit facility credit facility  depends on our satisfying various covenants  which require us to maintain certain levels of operating cash flow  debt coverage and net worth and limits our ability to make investments including investments in drivelogic  choiceparts and enterstand 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain of these covenants 
however  we received a waiver on february  from the banks lending under the credit facility with respect to these covenants 
in addition  on april   we received waivers for certain covenants for the quarter ending march  and restated future covenants 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the credit facility or otherwise 
however  we can give no assurances as to whether we will be able to obtain additional financing from other sources 
inability to obtain financing from alternative sources may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as a result of the acquisition of ccc international and the acquisition of dw norris limited  we have operations in the dw all foreign operations are measured in british pounds 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
as ccc international s growth expands and the potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increases  we will monitor such exposure and may engage in hedging against foreign currency fluctuations  as management deems appropriate
