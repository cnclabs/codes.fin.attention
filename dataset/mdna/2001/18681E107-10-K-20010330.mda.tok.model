following the implementation of sab  we recognize setup fees on a straight line basis over the term of the service contract 
we recognize email usage revenue based on the number of emails delivered and the related per email delivery charge 
we recognize email list management fees based on the number of email lists downloaded and delivered  and we recognize professional services fees as the services are rendered 
we recognize licensing fees over the terms of the contracts 
distributors and retailers may return our desktop software products according to negotiated terms or pursuant to any promotional terms that may be in effect 
we also provide end users with a day money back guarantee 
accordingly  we are exposed to the risk of product returns from retailers  distributors and end users  particularly during times of product transition 
in addition  promotional or other activities of competitors could cause returns to increase sharply at any time 
we establish reserves based on estimated future returns of products  taking into account promotional activities  the timing of new product introductions  distributor and retailer inventories of our products and other factors 
product returns that exceed our reserves could materially adversely affect our business

our net revenues increased million  or to million in  compared with net revenues of million in our net revenues increased million  or in from net revenues of million in we generate revenues primarily through the sale of desktop application software products to retailers and distributors 
during  sales of desktop application software products to retailers and consumers represented approximately of net revenues compared to in and in due to our shift in strategic focus from desktop software application programs for small businesses and home offices to erm products and services  we expect net revenues from our erm products and services to increase as a percentage of net revenues in future periods 
approximately of net revenues in were generated from sales of data directly downloaded by customers through our myprospects 
com site  licensing our software and services to our original equipment manufacturing oem partners  sales of annuity based products and direct sales of desktop application software products to customers 
we generated approximately of our net revenues in from sales of our web based erm products and services 
the increase in net revenues in compared to was primarily due to increased revenues from sales of our erm products and services to our enterprise clients 
the increase in net revenues in compared to was primarily due to increased revenues from the sales of our desktop software through retailers and oem partners 
the increase in net revenues was primarily the result of higher volume in number of units sold 
in year  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab  which summarizes sec s view in applying certain generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
as a result of the adoption of sab  we recognized a loss on adjustment of  in gross profit our gross profit margin was in  compared to in  and in the decreases in gross margin in from and in from were primarily due to the increased cost of sales associated with our erm products and services as well as higher promotional cost of sales with our desktop applications 
our gross margins vary from period to period due primarily to changes in product mix  the direct cost associated with our erm setup activities and professional services  the timing and nature of promotional activities  changes in product return levels  and the amortization of capitalized software product costs 
product development expenses our product development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net revenues  product development expenses were in  compared to in and in the increase in product development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in compared to was primarily due to our continued focus on the development of our erm products and services 
the increase in product development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in compared to was primarily due to the strategic shift in our focus from sales of desktop application software products and services to the development and sales of our erm and ecrm products and services 
product development expenses primarily consist of professional services or licensing fees  as well as internal development costs for our web based services which include payroll and payroll related expenses 
outside development costs for our software products are capitalized and amortized to the cost of revenues as the corresponding products are sold 
we have capitalized direct labor involved in the development of our ecrm software and will amortize it over a period of two years upon product completion  currently planned in mid we include the costs of identifying and validating product concepts and features in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in  in and in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues in from was primarily a result of reduced marketing costs accompanying our shift in strategic focus toward enterprise clients 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in from as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to our shift in product strategy and higher marketing expenses associated with the change of our corporate name 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain flat or slightly higher as a percentage of net revenues during as we continue to expand and enhance our erm products and services by building brand awareness and improving our client services and professional services infrastructure  as well as providing retail promotional activities for our desktop products 
in addition  we expect to incur additional sales and marketing expenses in connection with the introduction of our ecrm products and services which we expect to introduce in mid general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was primarily the result of an increase in the headcount and infrastructure expenses to support our growth 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was primarily the result of integration expenses associated with the markethome acquisition 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase slightly as a percentage of net revenues in to support our anticipated growth in erm products and services and the introduction of our ecrm products and services 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in from and in from were primarily the result of a flat organizational structure that increased efficiency and productivity 
restructuring charge and merger related expense in connection with the markethome acquisition  we incurred a one time merger related expense of  in interest income interest income increased to  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in interest income in compared to was due to higher average cash balances resulting in part from the proceeds of sales of additional shares of our common stock 
provision for income taxes we recorded  in income tax expense for fiscal year compared with  in due to the temporary timing differences between book and tax income  we had a net operating loss for income tax purposes in despite having net income for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  based on the uncertainty of future realization of deferred tax assets  our management does not believe that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to take advantage of all of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax assets 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we incurred a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in and a net income of  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  these uses were primarily attributable to our investment in the development of clickaction erm and clickaction ecrm products  the expansion of our sales force and the enhancement of the infrastructure necessary to support our growth and increase sales  which lead to an increase in accounts receivable 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  these uses were primarily attributable to expenses related to markethome acquisition and investment in our erm products and services 
our operating activities generated  of cash for the year ended december  the net cash generated was primarily attributed to cost reduction efforts that resulted in net income and positive cash flows for the year 
our investing activities used million of cash for the year ended december  these activities consisted of capital expenditures for the purchase of computer equipment and capitalized software costs that were primarily attributable to the development of clickaction erm and clickaction ecrm products 
our investing activities used  and  of cash for the years ended december  and these activities consisted of capital expenditures for the purchase of computer equipment and capitalized software costs that were primarily attributed to the development of our desktop application products 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  which primarily consisted of proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a series of private transactions 
our financing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december  which primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and exercise of stock options 
our financing activities provided  of cash for the year ended december  which primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and exercise of stock options 
historically  retail and distributor customers of our desktop application software products do not pay accounts receivables on timely basis in the first quarter due to various factors  including their reconciliation of annual sales for the previous fiscal year in order to determine the amount of credits they are due under our annual marketing credit program and their internal inventory re alignment 
as a result of this trend and the payment in the first quarter of accounts payable due as the end of the fiscal year  our available cash and cash equivalents during the first quarter are typically lower than during the remainder of our fiscal year 
since inception  we have financed our activities almost exclusively from cash generated by operations and equity financing 
we have no interest bearing debt instruments 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  cash equivalents and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt instruments 
the sale of additional equity or equity related securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
stock split on april   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of april  the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split
