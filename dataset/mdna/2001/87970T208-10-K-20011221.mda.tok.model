item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which provide the capability to bridge standard telecommunications equipment with wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs frequency bands collectively cellular 
applications of the company s technology include cellular fixed wireless telecommunications as a primary access service where wireline systems are unavailable  unreliable or uneconomical  as well as cellular backup systems for wireline telephone systems and cellular wireless security and alarm monitoring signaling 
the company s principal product lines are phonecell r  a line of cellular fixed wireless terminals and cellular fixed wireless desktop phones collectively fwts  and telguard r  a line of cellular wireless security and alarm monitoring signaling products 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new cellular wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview major trends driving the market for the company s products include a broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of next generation digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of cellular fwts as cost effective answers to customer demand for basic telecommunications and the trend of licensing multiple cellular operators in a given region  which intensifies competition among cellular wireless service providers to capture additional minutes of usage and the potential for a large wireline bypass market 
cellular wireless local loop wll  which is the core of the company s prospects for the phonecell r business in developing countries  involves cellular infrastructure employed predominately and sometimes exclusively for the fixed location user 
continued growth of the wll market depends primarily on the pricing of wll airtime service to the customer relative to available wireline prices  the relative local availability of wll and wireline service  operator regulatory constraints on fixed cellular  and availability of money in a given country 
these factors have contributed to an increase in the number of new cellular networks  primarily in africa  brazil  china  india  and mexico 
wireless competitive access  which represents the majority of the company s current sales in developed countries  has evolved as an alternative to existing wireline systems  and finds application where wireline service is unavailable  unreliable or uneconomic 
fwts are placed on cellular networks built for mobile cellular phones to provide regular telephone service 
management anticipates that additional cellular fwt markets for wireless competitive access applications will develop as existing cellular networks mature and new networks and high speed data services are introduced 
as capacity and price competition increase on new and existing cellular networks and the growth rate in new cellular phone subscribers slows  mobile cellular operators will be forced to look for new revenue sources 
cellular fwts provide an excellent opportunity for cellular network operators  as they are less costly to support than mobile units because fwts are permanently linked to a specific cell site  generate more average airtime  and operate mainly at off peak times 
the number of cellular fwts presently operating on these networks is driven by the relative price for airtime  as well as by the large installed base of cellular mobile networks worldwide 
the company sees a significant opportunity for growth in developed countries with the advent of high speed data services 
the company s strategy is to leverage its fifteen years of experience in the market  internationally accepted products and court tested patents into a continuing leadership position in the rapidly developing cellular fwt equipment industry 
global telecommunications equipment manufacturers together with national and international service providers are increasingly sharing the company s vision that cellular systems in both developed and developing countries are well suited for use as basic telephone service networks 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customer s needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
telular works closely with cellular service providers  telecommunications infrastructure suppliers and equipment manufacturers  to develop new cellular fixed wireless products for global wll markets

outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
based upon observed trends  the company believes that the market for cellular fwts will experience substantial growth over the next five years 
the company has identified significant growth opportunities in africa  brazil  china  india  mexico and the usa 
each of these markets will develop at a different pace  and the sales cycle for these regions are likely to be several months or quarters 
further  economic conditions play an important role in the timing of market development for the company s products 
in connection with the present global economic slowdown and the recession in the usa  the company s prospects for continued growth have been accordingly reduced in the near term 
however  as economic conditions improve  the company is well positioned with a wide range of products to capitalize on these market opportunities 
in recent months there has been considerable price pressure in the cellular fwt market  particularly for cdma products 
most cdma products are manufactured in korea  where several manufacturers are competing for the same business 
there appears to be a glut of cdma products  which has resulted in very low prices 
the company expects this trend to continue until next generation xrtt cdma networks and products become generally available 
the company expects to improve its position in the gsm fwt markets with the launch of its phonecell r sx gsm products with gprs in gprs in gsm networks also allow for the use of high speed data applications 
the company expects the market for cellular fwts to be favorably impacted by xrtt and gprs once these services become generally available  especially in developed countries 
shipments under the agreement with telcel to supply million desktop phones were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company is actively pursuing a renewal of this agreement  the outcome and timing of which will have a significant impact on the company s future revenues and profitability
