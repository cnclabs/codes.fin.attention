general we provide marine construction services to the oil and gas industry primarily in the gulf of mexico and selected international locations 
our marine fleet installs offshore pipelines to transport oil and gas from newly installed production platforms and other subsea production systems  and installs and salvages production platforms and other marine structures 
our present management team assumed its current role in and has aggressively expanded our operations 
we now have a fleet of eleven vessels capable of providing a full range of pipeline and derrick services in varying water depths 
we currently operate ten of these vessels  consisting of five pipelay pipebury barges  a dedicated pipebury barge  two derrick barges and two diving support vessels 
the demand for offshore construction services in the gulf depends largely on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction 
these expenditures are influenced by prevailing oil and gas prices  expectations about future demand and prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and abroad  political and economic conditions  governmental regulations  and the availability and cost of capital 
historically  oil and gas prices and the level of exploration and development activity have fluctuated substantially  impacting the demand for pipeline and marine construction services 
factors affecting our profitability include competition  equipment and labor productivity  contract estimating  weather conditions and the other risks inherent in marine construction 
the marine construction industry in the gulf is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions with the greatest demand for these services occurring during the second and third calendar quarters of the year
