item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since its inception in november  the company has been engaged primarily in research and development activities 
the company s operating revenues have been generated primarily from licensing fees  including  received from abbott for the right to manufacture and market hextend in the united states and canada 
biotime recently entered into a license agreement with horus under which biotime expects to receive up to  of license fees for the right to manufacture and market hextend overseas 
only one of the company s products is presently on the market  and since the company received fda approval to market hextend it has received  of royalties on sales 
as a result of the developmental nature of its business and the limited sales of its product  since the company s inception in november it has incurred  of losses 
the company s ability to generate substantial operating revenue depends upon its success in developing and marketing or licensing its plasma volume expanders and organ preservation solutions and technology for medical use 
most of the company s research and development efforts have been devoted to the development of the company s first three blood volume replacement products hextend  pentalyte  and hetacool 
by testing and bringing all three products to the market  biotime can increase its market share by providing the medical community with solutions to match patients needs 
the company s first product  hextend  is a physiologically balanced blood plasma volume expander  for the treatment of hypovolemia 
hextend is being sold in the united states by abbott laboratories under an exclusive license from the company 
abbott also has the right to sell hextend in canada  where an application for marketing approval is pending 
the company has granted horus an exclusive license to manufacture and sell hextend in all other parts of the world except japan 
sales of hextend by horus are expected to begin after regulatory approval to market hextend is obtained in the various countries under its license 
abbott and horus also have a right to obtain licenses to manufacture and sell other biotime products 
see licensing for more information about the licenses granted to abbott and horus 
under its license agreement with the company  abbott will report sales of hextend and pay the company the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
the company recognizes such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as the company does not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
revenues for the year ended december  include royalties on sales made by abbott during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalties on sales recognized as revenue during that twelve month period were  royalties on sales made during the three months ending december  were  but will not be recognized by the company for financial accounting purposes until the first quarter of fiscal year hextend sales are still in the ramp up phase  as illustrated by the following graph 
the following graph illustrates quarterly amounts derived from the quarterly sales reports provided to biotime by abbott with its royalty payments 
royalties on sales that occurred during the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended december   while royalties on sales that occurred during the fourth quarter of will be reflected in the company s financial statements for the first quarter of

as shown above  quarterly sales of hextend have increased approximately from the last quarter in  when the product was formally launched  through the last quarter of sales during the fourth quarter of may reflect the purchasing practices of certain wholesale distributors who increase their purchases of inventory during the last month of the year 
biotime attributes these percentage gains in quarterly sales to abbott s escalating marketing efforts and the accelerating demand for hextend by physicians and hospitals due to its outstanding performance in many hundreds of operating rooms around the country 
because hextend is a surgical product  sales will be determined by anesthesiologists  surgeons practicing a variety of specialties  and hospital pharmacists 
abbott s marketing strategy is designed to reach this target customer base through sales calls and an advertising campaign focused on the physiological basis of using a plasma like substance to replace lost blood volume and the ability of hextend to support vital physiological processes 
as part of the marketing program  abbott and the company have financed a number of studies showing the advantages of receiving hextend and other biotime products during surgery 
as these studies are completed  the results will be presented at medical conferences and articles will be written for publication in medical journals 
the company is also aware of independent studies using hextend that are being conducted by physicians and hospitals  who may publish their findings in medical journals 
horus is expected to conduct marketing studies as well after it obtains regulatory approval and begins to market hextend 
as these studies are completed  the results will be presented at medical conferences and articles will be written for publication in medical journals 
the outcome of the planned medical studies and timing of the publication of the results could have an effect on the growth of demand for and sales of hextend 
abbott is also working with hospitals to have hextend approved for use and added to hospital formularies  and has obtained formulary committee approval in hundreds of hospitals 
inclusion on hospital formularies is important because it enables physicians to obtain hextend without the need to special order it 
obtaining formulary approval can be a lengthy process and requires diligent efforts by the sales force who not only provide hextend to the hospital but also can provide the formulary committee with necessary information showing that the product is safe and effective 
to facilitate product acceptance  substantial quantities of hextend were introduced into hospitals at no charge 
while this may have caused a delay in revenues from product sales  it was effective in obtaining market penetration 
the company expects hextend sales to continue to grow as abbott continues its marketing efforts  as the number of hospital formularies that have approved hextend increases  and as surgeons and anaesthesiologists become more familiar with the benefits that can be attained for their patients by using hextend in operating rooms around the world 
abbott has concentrated on establishing hextend as the standard plasma volume expander at prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers  such as duke university medical center in durham  north carolina and columbia presbyterian medical center in new york  new york  which have switched to hextend from hetastarch in saline 
biotime feels that as hextend use proliferates withing the leading us hospitals  other smaller hospitals will follow their lead and accelerate sales growth 
the company has completed a phase i clinical trial of pentalyte and has submitted the test data to the fda  along with a proposed clinical trial protocol 
biotime plans to test pentalyte for the treatment of hypovolemia in surgery 
the company is also continuing to develop solutions for low temperature surgery 
once a sufficient amount of data from successful low temperature surgery has been compiled  the company plans to seek permission to use hextend as a complete replacement for blood under near freezing conditions 
biotime currently plans to market hextend for complete blood volume replacement at very low temperatures under the registered trade mark hetacool after fda approval is obtained 
abbott and orus each have an option to obtain a license to market pentalyte and hetacool in their respective territories  and biotime would receive additional license fees if those options are exercised  in addition to royalties on subsequent sales of those products 
in order to commence clinical trials for regulatory approval of new products or new therapeutic uses of products  it will be necessary for the company to prepare and file with the fda an investigational new drug application ind or an amendment to expand a previous filing 
filings with foreign regulatory agencies will be required to commence clinical trials overseas 
the company s application to market hextend in canada has been found acceptable for review as a new drug submission by the canadian health protection branch hpb  and the company is currently awaiting completion of hpb s review of that application 
during the third quarter of  the company filed its first application for approval in a european union member nation  sweden 
regulatory approvals for other countries that are members of the european union may be obtained through a mutual recognition process 
if approvals can be obtained in the requisite number of member nations  then the company would be permitted to market hextend in all member nations 
under its license agreement with biotime  horus will seek regulatory approval in other european union nations as well as in other non european union countries 
in addition to developing clinical trial programs  the company plans to continue to provide funding for its laboratory testing programs at selected universities  medical schools and hospitals for the purpose of developing additional uses of hextend  pentalyte  hetacool  and other new products  but the amount of research that will be conducted at those institutions will depend upon the company s financial status 
because the company s research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  and production and marketing expenses will be charged against earnings for financial reporting purposes  management expects that there may be losses from operations from time to time during the near future 
change of fiscal year in november  the board of directors approved a change to the company s operating fiscal year from a fiscal year ending june to a fiscal year ending december  beginning january  see note of notes to financial statements 
accordingly  the accompanying financial statements are for the twelve months ended december  and fiscal and fiscal respectively  the six months ended december   and the twelve months ended june  fiscal results of operations year ended december  and year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recognized  of royalty revenues 
under its license agreement with the company  abbott will report sales of hextend and pay the company the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
the company will recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as the company does not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of will not be recognized by the company until the first quarter of fiscal year during fiscal the company recognized  of license fees that were received from abbott during prior years 
no license fee revenue was received in fiscal for the year ended december   interest and other income decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to a decrease in clinical trials and laboratory study expenses  and completion of the european clinical trial 
research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  european clinical trial expenses  salaries  preparation of additional regulatory applications in the united states and europe  manufacturing of solution for trials  and consultants fees 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase as the company commences new clinical studies of its products in the united states and europe 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a decrease in the general operations of the company 
years ended december  and six month period ended december  during fiscal  the company received  for signing the abbott license agreement and achieving a license fee milestone pertaining to the allowance of certain patent claims pending 
during fiscal  the company received an additional milestone fee of  for filing its nda for hextend 
the company deferred recognition of a portion of the license fee payment received for signing of the license agreement 
the company recognized  of license fee revenue during fiscal   during fiscal   of license fee revenue during the six month period ended december  and  during fiscal interest and other income increased to  for fiscal from  for the six month period ended december  the increase in interest and other income is attributable to the increase in cash and cash equivalents from the company s sale of common shares through a subscription rights offering that was completed during february research and development expenses increased to  for fiscal  from  for the six month period ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is attributable to the cost of preparing and filing an nda for hextend  and preparing for future regulatory filings in europe and canada 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal  from  for the six month period ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in the general operations of the company  an increase in personnel  and bonus awards 
taxes at december  the company had a cumulative net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has primarily financed its operations through the sale of equity securities and licensing fees  and at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  the company expects to receive a  license fee from horus when horus confirms certain manufacturing and hydroxyethyl starch supply arrangements needed to manufacture hextend 
horus is working to put those arrangements in place  but there can be no assurance that those arrangements will be completed 
in the meantime  biotime may borrow up to  for working capital purposes under its credit agreement with alfred d 
kingsley  an investor and consultant to the company 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement will bear interest at per annum and will be due in one year or when biotime receives at least  through the sale of capital stock  loans from other lenders  fees under licensing agreements  or any combination of those sources 
mandatory prepayments of principal will be due to the extent that the company receives funds from any one or more of those sources in excess of  but less than  and the amount of any such mandatory prepayments of principal will reduce the maximum amount available under the credit agreement and will not be available for future borrowings 
the company will have the right to make voluntary prepayments of principal  that would otherwise not be due  without penalty or premium but with accrued interest  at any time  and any amounts voluntary prepaid will be available for future borrowings  so long as the company is not in default under the credit agreement and the outstanding principal balance loaned under the credit does not exceed  following receipt of the initial  license fee payment from horus  biotime will repay any loans under the credit agreement 
biotime will be entitled to receive  in additional license fees from horus upon the attainment of certain milestones pertaining to the commencement of sales in the european union and the issuance of certain european patents 
the date on which those license fees will be earned cannot be determined  but none is payable earlier than february  in addition  biotime may receive licensing fees for pentalyte and hetacool if horus exercises its right obtain licenses to manufacture and market those products 
horus may exercise its right to obtain a license for pentalyte or hetacool within days after biotime makes its first regulatory filing for the product in a european union country 
although biotime believes that its cash on hand and funds available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to allow it to continue its operations on a limited scale for months  it will need additional funds  including the license fees receivable from horus  to begin clinical trials of pentalyte and to conduct its other product development and research programs 
accordingly  additional funds are required for the successful completion of the company s product development activities 
the company will continue to seek licensing fees from pharmaceutical companies for licenses to manufacture and market the company s products in japan  but it is likely that additional sales of equity or debt securities will be required to meet the company s short term capital needs 
sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
the amount of license fees and royalties that may be earned through the licensing and sale of the company s products and technology  as well as the future availability and terms of equity and debt financings  is uncertain 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force the company to modify  curtail  delay or suspend some or all aspects of its planned operations
