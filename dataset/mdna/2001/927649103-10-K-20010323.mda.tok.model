on march   the company  formerly named agri nutrition group limited  merged with virbac  inc  with the company being the surviving corporation 
virbac sa  the parent of virbac  inc  received of the voting equity of the company  therefore  virbac  inc was considered to be the acquirer for financial statement purposes

under the plan  which was completed prior to the end of  all pet product distribution operations were transferred from agnu s chicago  illinois  and los angeles  california facilities to the company s larger fort worth  texas facility 
all manufacturing and distribution operations  which had been carried out at the chicago facility  ceased  and such operations were transferred to other existing company facilities 
in addition  manufacturing and distribution operations related to the majority of products previously produced at the los angeles facility were transferred to the fort worth facility  with only certain production and marketing activities remaining in california 
the cost to close the chicago facility  which mostly comprised severance costs and future lease obligations  and relocation costs for certain key members of the manufacturing team were approximately  the severance costs were paid as of december  and the lease obligation was paid in fiscal these costs are included in the purchase price allocation of the merger 
on december  the united states securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  which became effective for the company during the fourth quarter of this pronouncement required a change in the way in which the company records revenue 
prior to the implementation of sab  the company recognized revenues when the product was shipped from the company s distribution facility due to the transfer of the risk of loss 
since implementation of sab  the company now recognizes revenues when the risks of ownership have passed to the customer 
this is usually when the customer receives the product 
the cumulative effect of this change for periods prior to december  of  or per share is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations 
the net effect for fiscal of this change was to reduce sales by  and diluted earnings per share by

projections of gross margin improvements anticipated due to the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities and of expense reductions that may result from actual or planned headcount reductions may not be achieved if unforeseen difficulties arise in executing the plans or if assumptions made in the plans are not achieved 
forward looking statements regarding future sales may be affected by new competitive or technological entries into the market or by lack of acceptance of the company s products by the market 
projections regarding interest rates and changes to those rates could differ significantly from company projections 
the company receives significant support from its majority owner vbsa 
this support includes product development  research expenditures made that benefit the company  short term borrowings and worldwide distribution of the company s products 
projections of future revenues related to products not yet registered with certain governmental agencies could differ significantly if those registrations are not received in the time periods anticipated 
therefore  the company s actual results could differ materially from such forward looking statements

operating expenses in were million higher than or a increase 
as a percent of sales  the expenses were compared to for the decline in this ratio is attributable to the cost cutting efforts undertaken by the company in its facility closure plan 
somewhat offsetting this favorable trend was warehouse and distribution expenses  which were higher in due to higher sales volumes 
in addition  research and development expenses increased by million due to the company s increased efforts to get new products registered with the fda 
interest and other income interest expense for was million  which represents a million increase over the increase is due to higher borrowing levels during the year and higher interest rates 
the higher borrowing levels were due to the increased working capital the company needed to support its higher sales volumes 
the higher interest rates are due to the rising interest rate environment in the overall economy of the united states 
other income was million for  and there was no other income in other income in included the sale of licensing rights for million to a third party for the use of the company s rodenticide product

positive factors affecting sales were o increased volumes of the company s preventic r tick collar 
o the introduction of advanced formula and patent protected spherulites to the company s dermatological line  which management believes have led to an increase in market share in the dermatological line 
o increased volumes of bromethalin tm rodenticides 
these positive factors were partially offset by the following negative factors o a disruption to the dental line s marketing efforts caused by the relocation of the line s marketing staff from california to texas 
o increased competition in the otc distribution channel  particularly for the insecticides 
o a shift in the company s focus in the product lines sold through the otc distribution channel 
as the company integrates the francodex r business of virbac  inc with the st 
jon business of agri nutrition  it is focusing on the more profitable products as it eliminates duplication  thus impacting sales 
o distribution delays in the fourth quarter caused by the consolidation of the company s production and distribution facilities in california and illinois into its fort worth facility 
gross profit gross profit percentage increased to in compared to in primarily due to fixed overhead charges being absorbed by higher sales 
somewhat offsetting the positive impact of increased sales was approximately million of inventory write offs taken in conjunction with the consolidation of the company s production and distribution facilities during the fourth quarter of these write offs reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately percentage points 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses declined to million in from million in operating expenses include expenses incurred related to sales and marketing  research and development  warehouse and distribution  as well as general and administrative costs 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to actions taken by agri nutrition in to reduce costs and to cost cutting measures taken in the second quarter by the company involving the consolidation of certain commercial and administrative functions 
these measures include a reduction in commercial and administrative personnel that reduced comparative costs 
partially offsetting these expense reductions were expected increases in variable costs related to the increase in sales as discussed above  and approximately million of non recurring expenses incurred in connection with the operations of virbac  inc  including certain severance payments to virbac  inc employees  including the former president of the company 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses decreased from of sales in to in  reflecting the cost reductions discussed above 
income taxes the company did not record an income tax benefit in connection with its operating loss in or in the aggregate amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at december  was approximately million 
during the company adjusted its deferred tax assets increasing them by million and recognized a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance reflects management s view that it is more likely than not that tax benefits related to the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the primary factor affecting management s view in this regard is the company s losses from operations in prior years 
net loss net loss in of million improved by million compared to the net loss in based on the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources for year ended december  the company s primary sources of liquidity during were cash flows from operations  sales of product licenses and bank borrowings 
net income and depreciation and amortization generated operating cash flows of million  which was partially offset by uses of cash to purchase inventory and to fund increased accounts receivable 
the inventory increase was a planned increase of inventory so that product would be available for sale in the first quarter to meet expected demand resulting from an oral hygiene promotional campaign the company is undertaking 
receivables increased due to the increased sales volume the company experienced in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in cash flows from investing activities were favorably affected by the pfizer agreement reached in and were unfavorably affected by the payments to a third party for rights to new products 
in the company reached an agreement to sublicense to pfizer inc the company s north american distribution rights for two equine products 
under the terms of the agreement  the company received an initial cash payment of million  some or all of which is subject to repayment if the company has not obtained fda approval to sell the products or certain other conditions are not met by december  this product license fee will be recognized over the longer of the contract period  years or the expected period of future benefits 
the expected period of future benefits has not yet been determined 
in  the company acquired the rights to manufacture and sell products currently in development by a third party for a period of years 
in fiscal and  the company paid million and million  respectively for such rights  and  depending upon the third party reaching certain milestones with respect to obtaining u 
s 
food and drug administration fda approval to sell such products  is committed to paying in fiscal and approximately million and million  respectively 
the company will begin to amortize these rights when the fda approval is granted over the shorter of the contract period or the expected period of the benefit 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect the activity of the company s revolving line of credit with a bank 
this line of credit is primarily used to fund working capital needs 
during  vbsa advanced and the company repaid million 
the company paid interest on the advance at the prime rate then in effect in the united states 
on september   the company replaced all of its then existing credit facilities with a three year million facility that expires on july  in december  the company obtained a temporary million increase to its line of credit to fund acquisition fees related to its acquisition of certain product manufacturing and distribution rights discussed above and to fund working capital increases related to the consolidation of the company s production facilities 
this temporary increase was to be repaid in installments from february to july of the remaining million  million is subject to a borrowing formula based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory and serves as a revolving line of credit 
the availability of the remaining million will be reduced by  per quarter 
the interest rate and fees vary based upon the financial performance of the company as measured by the ratio of ebitda to interest expense paid and current maturities due 
interest rates can vary from prime plus basis points to prime minus basis points 
at december   million was available under the credit facility  as amended  and the interest rate was prime minus basis points  or 
a commitment fee  ranging from 
to  is calculated on the unused portion of the facility to be paid quarterly 
in addition  a letter of credit commitment fee  ranging from to  per annum  based upon financial performance ratios  are calculated for all letters of credit issued up to and including october  and thereafter 
at december   there were  in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  issued principally in conjunction with the purchase of inventory 
the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants  including  tangible net worth and interest coverage ratios  and restricts the payment of dividends 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of these covenants 
the company has no current plans to significantly increase capacity of any of its plant facilities or to expend significant capital in modifying them 
the company had net issuances of million of common stock during these issuances were primarily related to the company s incentive stock option plan that is available to most of the management of the company 
the company expects to be able to fund its fiscal cash requirements through cash flows from operations and availability under the credit agreement 
the company believes that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its current debt maturity requirements  licensing fees commitments and capital expenditure needs 
the company has no plans to pay dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
for year ended december  the company s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings and cash infusion from vbsa 
although million was generated by the company s operations before depreciation and amortization  operating activities used million of cash in due primarily to an increase in inventory and a reduction to trade payables 
inventory increased for several reasons including the build up in inventory prior to commencing the consolidation of the manufacturing and distribution facilities to reduce the interruption of service to customers  low levels of inventory at the beginning of the year  which had created a significant back order position  and the build up of inventory by pmr to serve the dealer distribution network 
in addition  accounts payable decreased by approximately million reflecting more timely payments to vendors and suppliers 
cash flows used in investing activities in include cash costs related to the merger  capital improvements at the company s bridgeton and fort worth facilities  and acquisition fees related to the in licensing of certain products 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect primarily the merger with agri nutrition group 
in conjunction with the merger  virbac sa invested approximately million of cash in the company 
these funds were used to pay down debt and to repurchase  shares of the company s outstanding common stock at per share in april pursuant to the mandatory tender offer required under the merger agreement 
in addition  borrowing under a credit facility increased to fund working capital needs and the investments described above 
at december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants under its credit facility 
however  the lending bank waived such non compliance for periods through april  on may   the bank amended the revolving credit facility and the company would have been in compliance with such amended covenants at december  at december   million was available under the credit facility  as amended 
the company was committed to conduct a public tender offer to purchase up to  of the company s outstanding common stock at a price of per share if  prior to the second anniversary of the merger march  the closing sale price of the company s common stock has not reached per share for a period of consecutive trading days 
pursuant to the merger agreement  such tender offer  if necessary  would be funded by virbac sa s direct purchase from the company of  shares of common stock at per share 
however  as of august   the closing price of the company s stock was per share or greater for consecutive trading days so this tender offer was not required and will not be made for the year ended december  in  the company s primary sources for liquidity came from advances from vbsa and proceeds from borrowings from a financial institution 
the company s operations used cash of million  which was due to a net loss for the year 
somewhat offsetting the impact of the loss  was depreciation expense and lower investments in inventory and accounts receivable 
however  prepaid expenses used cash flow during the period 
the changes in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses were a matter of timing of when the investment was made compared to prior periods 
the company had a note payable to vbsa at december  in the amount of million 
this note carried an interest rate of  and was converted to equity in connection with the merger 
the company also had two notes payable and a revolving line of credit facility with various financial institutions totaling million at december  these notes and facilities had interest rates ranging between and 
during the company increased its borrowing under these loans by million 
all of these loans were guaranteed by vbsa  and were converted into a new credit facility in quarterly effects and seasonality the results of operations of certain products in the veterinary product line  including virbac s flea and tick collars  have been seasonal with a lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the results of operations of the company s otc segment have also been seasonal with a relatively lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s fourth quarter 
seasonal patterns of pm resources operations are highly dependent on weather  feeding economics and the timing of customer orders 
in addition  consolidation of certain manufacturing  distribution  commercial and administrative functions between agnu and virbac  inc during will impact the comparative results of the company between quarters and in future periods 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet measured at fair value 
the original implementation date of fas has been extended and it is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or related disclosures
