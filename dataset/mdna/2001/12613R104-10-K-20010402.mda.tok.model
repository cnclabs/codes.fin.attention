item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if force to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less that and the company doesn t exert significant influence 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired
