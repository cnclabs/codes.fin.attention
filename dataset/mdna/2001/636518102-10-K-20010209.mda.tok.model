item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of a number of important factors 
for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the risk factors set forth below in factors affecting the company s business  in the financial line item discussions below and elsewhere in this document 
overview national instruments corporation designs  develops  manufactures and markets instrumentation and automation software and hardware for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems for measurement and automation 
the company has identified a large and diverse market for test and measurement t m and industrial automation ia applications 
the company s products are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing and industrial control 
in test and measurement applications  the company s products can be used to monitor and control traditional instruments or to create computer based instruments that can replace traditional instruments 
in industrial automation applications  the company s products can be used in the same ways as in test and measurement and can also be used to integrate measurement functionality with process automation capabilities 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company s revenues have grown every year since and the company has been profitable in every year since there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will continue to grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense net foreign exchange gain loss income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income net sales 
in  net sales for the company s products reached million  a increase from the level achieved in  which followed an increase in net sales of in over the level achieved in this year marks the twenty fourth year of consecutive double digit annual sales growth 
the increase in sales in these periods is primarily attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products in each period  increased market acceptance of the company s products in each of the major geographical areas in which the company operates  and an expanded customer base 
the increase in the revenue growth rate to from in  is attributed to an increase in unit sales growth in all regions  a broad increase in demand for the company s products and significant growth in newer product areas such as pxi  machine vision  motion control  fieldpoint and pc based instruments 
north american revenue was million in  an increase of from  following a increase in over the increase in sales and in the revenue growth rate in north america in is primarily attributable to market acceptance of the company s new products  an expanded sales force and a recovery from the industry downturn in early european revenue was million in  an increase of over  following a increase in from the increase in revenue in europe is primarily attributable to continued market acceptance of the company s new products  the strong local economies and the company s expansion in its european sales force 
asia pacific revenue grew to million in  which followed a increase in over levels 
the increase in the asia pacific revenue growth rate during is primarily attributed to the success of the company s new products  an expanded sales force and the continued improvement in the state of the asian economies 
see the discussion below for more information concerning the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales growth 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing market presence in existing markets  and continuing to use distributors to sell its products in countries in which the sales volume does not justify direct sales activities 
the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in and in previous years 
the company s foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see foreign exchange gain loss below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s growth rate for would have been 
pro forma european sales for would have increased by over sales 
pro forma asia pacific sales for would have increased by over sales 
if the weighted average value of the dollar during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million 
the preceding pro forma amounts and percentages are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles but are presented for comparative purposes 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented  and in   and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
the lower margin in is the result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  lost capacity and increased overhead costs related to delayed receipt of components from suppliers 
in  improved production efficiencies and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in higher margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its historical margins 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company is currently working to establish a new manufacturing facility in hungary in q of this new facility will be required in order to meet the customer demand anticipated in q  any delay in making this capacity available could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increase in the expense in absolute amounts during and is primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing personnel both internationally and in north america  increased marketing for new products and web marketing and sales activities 
sales and marketing personnel increased by during from at december  to  at december  sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of revenue was in  down from in and the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on new recruiting  initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases and entry into new market areas  investment in the web sales and marketing efforts  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international sales conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense in increased compared to following an increase of in over excluding the pre tax charge for the write off of in process research and development  on a pro forma basis  research and development expense grew  and during  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in research and development expenditures excluding the acquisition related charges in in absolute amounts and as a percentage of sales in each period was primarily due to increases in personnel costs from hiring of additional product development engineers 
research and development personnel increased from at december  to at december  the company believes that a significant  ongoing investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and continue revenue growth 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic useful life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
software amortization expense totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million  million and million  respectively 
the increased levels of capitalization for were primarily a result of the development of labview i  ni daq and max the significant items capitalized in were primarily the result of ni daq  lookout and purchased software development costs related to the gfs acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of intangibles 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased from  which followed an increase of in from a significant amount of the increase was due to the increase in legal costs primarily from a million accrual for anticipated patent defense costs 
the increase was also comprised of cost attributable to staffing increases in the information system  finance  legal and human resources departments and significant increases in recruiting costs due to the continued growth in the target number of engineering recruits 
continued development of web and e commerce offerings were the main areas of focus for incremental investment in the information system department in the increase followed a increase in  which was primarily driven by support of the new management information systems and web based applications 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to during from in the increase in was primarily due to the million accrual for future patent defense costs recorded in the fourth quarter of the company expects that general and administrative costs will continue to increase in absolute amounts and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as the company continues to invest in maintaining its existing systems  developing the infrastructure for the new hungarian manufacturing facility  and developing web based commerce and management information systems 
interest income and expense 
interest income increased in from  which followed an increase of in from the primary source of interest income is from the investment of proceeds from the company s issuance of common stock under an initial public offering in march and cash flow generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
during  interest income increased due to the investment of cash generated from operations 
interest expense increased from  which followed a decrease of in from interest expense represents less than of net sales and fluctuates as a result of bank borrowings and interest terms thereon 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s debt 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of million in  compared to gains of  in and losses of  in these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s sales subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its receivables foreign exchange forward contracts to days 
the company also utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency purchased option contracts in order to reduce its exposures to fluctuations in future foreign currency cash flows 
the company purchases these contracts for up to of its forecasted cash flows in selected currencies primarily the euro  yen and pound sterling and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
the foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the company does not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
the company s hedging strategy reduced the foreign exchange loss for december  by million and reduced the net foreign exchange loss for december  by million 
effective january   the company elected to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in and and in the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of tax exempt interest and reduced tax rates in certain international locations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels 
receivable days outstanding at december  increased to days from days at december  consolidated inventory balances have increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year for represent a decrease from turns of per year for and reflect the planned increase in the level of inventory related to allocated components and increased procurement of end of life components 
the company expects these high inventory levels to persist until the component supply situation has eased significantly 
cash used for investing activities in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment and capitalization of software development costs of million 
in october of  the company began construction of an office building mopac c located on the north austin campus 
it is currently anticipated that a significant portion of the construction costs will be paid out of the company s existing working capital 
the company estimates the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  will range from million to million 
in october of  the company entered into firm commitments of approximately million for the new building 
the company has incurred approximately million in construction costs as of december   with the remainder becoming payable in the actual level of spending may vary depending on a variety of factors  including unforeseen difficulties in construction 
upon completion of the mopac c building  the company intends to vacate its existing  sq 
ft 
millenium office building 
the company has signed an agreement to lease the millenium building to a third party and currently estimates that the net rental income from this lease will offset approximately of the projected operating costs from the mopac c building 
the company also plans to construct a second manufacturing facility to be located in hungary 
the company estimates that this european manufacturing facility will be operational by q of  and that by will source a significant portion of the company s international sales 
the location of the facility has a cost base and tax rate significantly lower than in the us  which should have the effect of reducing the cost of manufacturing and lowering the consolidated tax rate 
however  there can be no assurance that the actual manufacturing costs will be lower 
it is currently anticipated that a significant portion of the construction costs will be paid out of the company s existing working capital with any remaining costs being funded through credit from the company s current financial institutions 
the company estimates the total cost for the new facility  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  will be approximately million 
the actual level of spending may vary depending on a variety of factors  including unforeseen difficulties in construction 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances and internally generated funds 
as of december   the company had no debt outstanding to financial institutions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s debt 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on the company s earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  the company utilizes purchased foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate fair market value of all instruments outstanding of approximately million 
however  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  management believes that a loss in fair value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december  and short term investments 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of less than  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to certain revenue recognition issues 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or overall trends in results of operations 
factors affecting the company s business us global economic slowdown 
as has occurred in the past  most recently in when the asian economic situation and its effects on the us economy resulted in a slowdown in automated test equipment  semiconductor and other markets  the markets in which the company does business could again experience the negative effects of a slowdown in the us and or global economies 
downturns in the us or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
risk of component shortages 
as has occurred in the past  most recently in the quarter ended december   supply shortages of components including sole source components can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing 
component shortages  including components from analog devices  inc  have continued in the first quarter and if the company is unsuccessful in resolving these issues  it will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue and or an increase in manufacturing costs  either of which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
expansion of manufacturing capacity 
the company is working to establish a new manufacturing facility which is to be located in hungary 
it is anticipated that this facility will be in operation by q  this additional capacity is required to meet anticipated customer demand in q  any delay in bringing this facility into production could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
factors  which could result in a delay in bringing this new facility into production  include possible delays in construction  difficulties in recruiting and training the local work force and possible difficulties in establishing the required information systems 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the local currencies in which the company sells weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company will experience a deterioration of its gross and net profit margins 
the company expects the strength of the us dollar to have a negative effect on gross and net profit margins in future quarters 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company has significant revenues from customers in industries such as semiconductors  automated test equipment  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in recent years  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
if this historical pattern continues  revenues and earnings for the first quarter of may not exceed revenues from the fourth quarter of also  the company s results of operations in the third quarter of may be adversely affected by lower sales levels in europe  which typically occur during the summer months 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
in addition  total operating expenses have in the past tended to be higher in the second and third quarters of each year  due to college recruiting and significantly increased intern personnel expenses 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
risks associated with increased development of web site 
the company has devoted significant resources in developing its web site as a key marketing and sales tool and expects to continue to do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempt to leverage the web to increase sales 
the company hosts its web site internally 
failure to successfully maintain the web site and to protect it from hackers could have a significant impact on the company s results 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than the company  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is agilent technologies inc agilent 
agilent offers its own line of instrument controllers  and also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
agilent is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of agilent s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company devoted significant resources to the continued development of web and e commerce offerings 
in  the company will focus on implementing information systems to support its new manufacturing facility in europe and upgrading its worldwide business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i 
the company will also be implementing an advanced planning system to enhance predictability of material flow in its manufacturing operations and will continue to devote significant resources to the development of the web 
failure to successfully implement these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
the company relies on three primary regional centers for its management information systems 
as with any information system  unforeseen issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information  which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if such a shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues  as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted due to the shipments  which would not occur until the following period 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s international direct sales offices are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s growth rate for would have been 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million 
if the us dollar strengthens again in the future  it could have a materially adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
sole source components purchased by the company include custom application specific integration circuits asics and other components 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
accordingly  the failure to receive sole source components from suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on revenues and results of operations 
proprietary rights and intellectual property litigation 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in its principal products 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of the company s intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the industry  the company from time to time may be notified that it is infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others 
on may   the company was served by cognex corporation  asserting patent infringement of two cognex patents  copyright infringement  trademark infringement and unfair competition 
cognex seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  actual monetary damages in an unspecified amount and attorney s fees and costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company accrued million  the estimated legal fees for defending this litigation 
the cognex litigation and any other intellectual property litigation initiated in the future may cause significant litigation expense  liability and a diversion of management s attention which may have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
dependence on key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  sales  marketing  research and development and operational personnel including dr 
truchard and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
the company also believes its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  research and development  and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies  including companies acquired through acquisition  as well as training  motivating and supervising the employees 
in addition  the recruiting environment for software engineering  sales and other technical professionals is very competitive 
competition for qualified software engineers is particularly intense and is likely to result in increased personnel costs 
failure to attract or retain qualified software engineers could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company also recruits and employs foreign nationals to achieve its hiring goals primarily for engineering and software positions 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to be able to recruit foreign nationals to the current degree 
these factors further intensify competition for key personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel or attracting and retaining additional key personnel 
failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
risk of product liability claims 
the company s products are designed in part to provide information upon which the users may rely 
the company attempts to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in its products  and to limit its product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability  including disclaimers in its shrink wrap license agreements with end users 
if future products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely  customer acceptance of the company s products could be adversely affected 
further  the company could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
although the company maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual provisions used by the company to limit its liability will be sufficient
