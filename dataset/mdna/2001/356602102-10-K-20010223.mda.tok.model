item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview freemarkets is a leader in creating business to business online markets and providing electronic commerce technology and services for the procurement of industrial parts  raw materials  commodities and services 
freemarkets combines its proprietary technology platform with information on the procurement or sourcing of direct materials  commodity specific domain knowledge and services to deliver measurable savings to customers 
freemarkets has created over  online markets for more than billion worth of goods and services  resulting in estimated savings of over billion for its customers 
freemarkets has enabled its customers to source products from more than supply verticals 
more than  suppliers from over countries have participated in online markets created by freemarkets 
in addition to its fullsource offering  which provides customers with the full range of freemarkets technology  services and information  freemarkets offers its directsource and quicksource hosted services  which enable customers to run their own online markets 
freemarkets also operates the freemarkets asset exchange for buyers and sellers of surplus assets and inventory 
determination of online market volume and achievable savings we believe that one indicator of our market acceptance is the dollar volume of materials  commodities and services for which we create online markets on behalf of our customers 
we measure this online market volume by multiplying the lowest bid price per unit in each online market by the estimated number of units that our customer expects to purchase 
when our customers specify multi year purchases in a request for quotation  we calculate online market volume for the estimated term 
online market volume does not necessarily correlate with either our revenues or our operating results in any particular period due to the seasonality of our customers purchasing needs  the timing of the addition of new customers  the length of the customer contracts and the industry in which the items in the online markets will be used 
we believe that online market volume may be correlated with revenues and operating results over periods of one year or longer  however  because of our limited operating history  a strong correlation has not yet been demonstrated 
moreover  online market volume has varied in the past  and we expect it to vary in the future 
the following table sets forth our online market volume for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions online market volume   we believe that the savings achievable by customers through our online markets is an indicator of the effectiveness of our online market services 
to estimate these savings  we compare the last price paid by our customer for the items in our online markets against the lowest bid price for those items in our online market 
actual savings that our customers achieve may not equal these estimates because our customer may not select the lowest bid price  the parties may agree to change price terms after our online market or our customer may not actually buy all or any of the items for which bids have been received in our online markets 
many of our agreements with customers provide for incentive compensation based on online market volume and or savings 
these agreements may calculate online market volume or savings differently than the methods we use to calculate online market volume and savings for the purposes described above 
revenues we generate revenues under service agreements with our customers 
our service agreements typically provide us with revenues from fixed monthly fees  and may also include performance incentive payments based on volume and or savings 
the revenue structure in a particular service agreement may vary  depending upon the needs of our customer and the conventional practices in the supply market where our customer obtains its materials  commodities or services 
the monthly fees that we receive are for the use of our technology  supplier and supply market information  market making and market operations staff and facilities 
negotiated monthly fees vary by customer  and reflect both the anticipated online market volume and the staffing  expertise and technology we anticipate committing to complete the services requested by our customers 
fixed monthly fees constitute a majority of our revenues  and we expect that these monthly fees will continue to constitute a majority of our revenues 
we recognize revenues from our fixed monthly fees ratably as we provide services 
our agreements range in length from a few months to as many as five years 
at any given time  we have agreements of varying lengths with staggered expirations 
some of our service agreements permit early termination by our customers without penalty 
many of our agreements include performance incentive payments that are contingent upon our customer achieving specific online market volume and or savings  as set forth in the respective agreements 
we recognize these revenues as the thresholds are achieved 
we expect that as our volume grows  the revenues attributable to these incentive payments will also grow over time in terms of absolute dollars  but not necessarily as a percentage of revenues 
limited operating history our limited operating history makes predicting future operating results very difficult 
we believe that you should not rely on the period to period comparison of our operating results to predict our future performance 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
although we have experienced significant percentage growth in revenues in recent periods  we may not be able to sustain our prior growth rates 
our prior growth may not be indicative of future operating results 
customer concentration we depend on united technologies and visteon for a material portion of our revenues 
in october  we entered into a three year contract extension with united technologies 
in april  we entered into a five year agreement with visteon that provides for a fixed monthly payment stream larger than any other current customer contract 
revenue concentration from united technologies and visteon  in the aggregate  was in and in we anticipate that we will continue to diversify our base of customers by adding new customers and increasing sales to existing customers  and that the percentage of total revenues we derive from united technologies and visteon will decrease 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating costs research and development  excluding stock compensation sales and marketing  excluding stock compensation and warrant costs general and administrative  excluding stock compensation stock compensation research and development stock compensation and warrant costs sales and marketing stock compensation general and administrative goodwill amortization write off of in process research and development operating loss income interest and other income  net net loss income years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to a larger number of new customers for which we conducted online markets  as well as increased use of our services by existing customers 
the number of customers served increased from in to in online market volume grew from billion in to billion in cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased from in to in the increase in absolute dollar amounts from to reflects an increase in the number of market making staff to serve our growing customer base and the increased cost of our operations due to the expansion of our office space and our services into international locations 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from to is primarily the result of increased staff productivity as our personnel became more specialized in various market making activities 
also  we have attained some operating efficiencies from our investments in information tools to automate portions of our market making process  as well as organizing our market making staff in such a way to take advantage of our domain supply vertical expertise 
although we will continue to invest in the growth of our business  we expect gross margins to continue to increase in the future 
operating costs research and development  excluding stock compensation 
research and development costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in absolute dollars relates primarily to an increase in the number of research and development staff and associated costs for the continued development of our bidware software and other market making technology  which is designed to further improve staff productivity 
as a result of a change in certain information technology initiatives  we recognized additional depreciation and other charges of million in the third quarter of related to capitalized software and other computer equipment 
we expect to increase our research and development costs in absolute dollars in future periods to invest in new technology for future product and service offerings  particularly our e sourcing platform  and to adapt and add features to our existing technology  however  we anticipate these costs will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
sales and marketing  excluding stock compensation and warrant costs 
sales and marketing costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in absolute dollars reflects a significant growth in sales and marketing staff  public relations costs  trade shows and advertising as we pursued our brand and business development strategy and accelerated our spending on potential future growth 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in future periods to promote our brand  to pursue our business development strategy and to increase the size of our sales force  however  we anticipate these costs will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
general and administrative  excluding stock compensation 
general and administrative costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to the addition of personnel to our general and administrative staff in the areas of technical operations  human resources  legal  finance and facilities management 
the increase can also be attributed to the expansion of our infrastructure from four offices at the end of to eighteen offices at the end of  many of which are international offices to support our growing customer base 
as a result of our transition to a globally integrated enterprise resource planning erp system  we recognized additional depreciation and other charges of million in the third quarter of related to software and other computer equipment 
we expect that general and administrative costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to add staff and infrastructure to support our domestic and international business growth and bear the increased costs associated with being a public company  however  we anticipate these costs will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues in future periods 
stock compensation and warrant costs 
the company recorded million of unearned stock compensation related to employee stock options granted in june and july  which is being amortized over a five year period ending june in and   and  respectively  was amortized related to these grants 
in september  the company recorded million of stock expense related to warrants granted to a customer 
in april  the company also recorded million of unearned stock expense related to warrants granted to another customer  which is being amortized over a five year period ending april in  million was amortized related to these warrants

goodwill amortization 
in connection with our acquisitions of imark 
com  inc imark and surplus record  inc 
and sr auction  inc 
collectively  surplus record in march  we recorded goodwill of million  of which million was amortized in write off of in process research and development 
also in connection with our acquisition of imark in march  we recorded a one time write off of in process research and development of million 
interest and other income  net interest and other income was  in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income from the investment of proceeds from our initial public offering ipo into interest bearing  investment grade securities 
in  we earned million of interest income at a weighted average rate of return of 
interest and other income was partially offset by million of asset write offs in years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increased number of new customers for which we conducted online markets  as well as increased use of our services by existing customers 
the number of customers served increased from in to in revenues in both periods were concentrated in two customers  united technologies and general motors 
revenues from united technologies increased from million in to million in due to its increased use of our online market services and technology 
revenues from general motors increased from million in to million in due to the incremental effect of its long term agreement with us beginning in june  as well as the growth of the revenues earned under this agreement from delphi automotive systems  a former subsidiary of general motors 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased from to 
the increase in absolute dollar amounts from to reflects an increase in the number of market making staff and the increased cost of our operations due to a relocation of our headquarters to a larger facility 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our rapid growth in the number of customers served from in to in  many of which enter into short term agreements with us initially in order to try our services before committing to longer term relationships 
generally  we do not achieve economies of scale early in a customer relationship 
therefore  our gross margins are typically lower in the early stages of a customer relationship 
also  our gross margins in were favorably affected by a million performance incentive from united technologies 
operating costs research and development  excluding stock compensation 
research and development costs increased from  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues relates primarily to an increase in the number of research and development staff and associated costs for the continued development of our bidware software and other market making technology  which is designed to further improve staff productivity 
sales and marketing  excluding stock compensation and warrant costs 
sales and marketing costs increased from  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues reflects a significant ramp up in sales and marketing staff  public relations costs  trade shows and advertising as we pursued our brand and business development strategy and accelerated our spending on potential future growth 
as a result  sales and marketing costs in included certain costs not incurred in the same period in  such as those for advertising in professional trade magazines  airport advertising and other promotions 
general and administrative  excluding stock compensation 
general and administrative costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to the addition of personnel to our general and administrative staff in the areas of technical operations  human resources  legal  finance and facilities management 
the increase is also attributable to start up costs of  and other recurring costs of million associated with our european subsidiary  which we established in late stock compensation and warrant costs 
in september  we issued warrants to a subsidiary of united technologies to purchase  shares of series d preferred stock at an exercise price of 
per share  in exchange for united technologies agreement to delete from its contract with us provisions that limited our ability to render services to its competitors 
as a result  we recorded a one time expense of million in september additionally  we recorded million of unearned stock compensation related to employee stock options granted in june and july in   was amortized related to these grants 
we also recorded a one time charge of  to stock compensation related to options granted to our assistant secretary  who is neither an employee nor a director 
interest and other income  net interest and other income was  in compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income from the investment of proceeds from our ipo into interest bearing  investment grade securities 
additionally  we received an economic development grant from the commonwealth of pennsylvania for  during and wrote off property and equipment of  related to our move to our new headquarters in liquidity and capital resources we have historically satisfied our cash requirements primarily through a combination of revenues  equity financing transactions and bank borrowings 
in december  we completed our ipo  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and working capital of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in our use of cash in was primarily attributable to an increase in working capital 
the use of cash in and related primarily to the operating loss generated by our investment in the growth of our business  including an increase in personnel from at the end of to at the end of in addition  in march  we began leasing a significantly larger corporate headquarters facility 
the lease  which runs through may  currently requires an annual lease payment of million 
our lease payments will grow as we take additional office space 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  in  million in and in our use of cash in investing activities in resulted primarily from our continued additions to and upgrade of computing and telecommunications equipment 
at the end of  we began purchasing equipment and reduced our use of leased equipment 
during and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  to furnish our new facility and purchase computing and telecommunications equipment to accommodate our increase in personnel 
we also spent million and million in and  respectively  to purchase short term investments  partially offset by the maturity of short term investments totaling million in we also used million related to acquisitions that closed in march net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in the positive financing cash flows in  and primarily reflect the net proceeds from the issuance of stock  bank borrowings and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by financing activities in was partially offset by the repayment of debt assumed in the imark acquisition 
prior to november  we had in place a million bank facility  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and two equipment loans originally totaling million 
in november  we terminated the million facility and entered into a one year revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing base of million 
at december   million was available based on eligible accounts receivable 
borrowings under the new facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
as of december   million was outstanding under the facility and the interest rate was 
our current bank credit facility contains restrictive covenants  including a limitation on incurring additional indebtedness and paying dividends 
our bank credit facility also includes requirements as to minimum tangible net worth and current and debt service ratios 
we have pledged substantially all of our tangible assets as collateral for the current credit facility 
capital expenditures were million in and million in capital expenditures over these periods were primarily made to purchase computer and telecommunications equipment and furnishings in our new corporate headquarters and other offices  as well as to expand our network and server capacity 
in  we implemented an erp that more fully integrates our financial systems and other operational reporting 
this system went live in october we funded these capital expenditures through a combination of sales of our equity securities and bank borrowings 
we intend to fund future capital expenditures through a combination of proceeds from our ipo  bank borrowings and cash from operations 
as a result of the significant investments we have made in our operations  infrastructure and personnel in  we anticipate a decrease in our capital expenditures in future periods 
we expect to experience growth in our operating costs for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan  particularly in the areas of research and development and sales and marketing 
we also expect to open new domestic and international offices in order to support the needs of our existing and anticipated customers 
as a result  we estimate that these operating costs  as well as other planned expenditures  will constitute a significant use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may use cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
we believe that our current cash resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next to months 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional financing 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
income taxes we incurred a net taxable loss in and  and therefore did not record a provision for income taxes in those periods 
in  we offset our net taxable income through the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
we may use these operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal and state income taxes through and  respectively 
however  in we sold a sufficient amount of our convertible preferred stock to constitute an ownership change under the internal revenue code  as a result  our future utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards that we accumulated prior to that change in ownership  amounting to million  will be subject to a limitation of  per year 
we may generate additional net operating loss carryforwards in the future  however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to fully utilize all of them 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 which is effective for all quarters beginning january   establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk nearly all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in united states dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
we have several subsidiaries located in europe  asia and australia  and we intend to establish additional foreign subsidiaries 
in the future  a portion of the revenues we derive from international operations may be denominated in foreign currencies 
we incur costs for our overseas offices in the local currency of those offices for staffing  rent  telecommunications and other services 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in international markets 
although currency fluctuations are currently not a material risk to our operating results  we have and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and when appropriate  we will continue to use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations in the future 
we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because all of our investments are in short term instruments 
borrowings under our existing credit lines are also interest rate sensitive  because the interest rate charged by our bank varies with changes in the prime rate of lending 
we believe  however  that we are currently not subject to material interest rate risk
