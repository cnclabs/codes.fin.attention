derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between middleby affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties 
additionally  the company enters into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates on intercompany and third party trade receivables and payables 
the company does not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in managing its foreign currency exposures  the company identifies and aggregates naturally occurring offsetting positions and then hedges residual exposures

certain risk factors that may affect future results quarterly variations in operating results 
results of the company s operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
such fluctuations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing of orders from major customers  the timing of new product introductions  the loss of any of its significant customers or distributors  currency fluctuations  disruption in the supply of components for the company s products  changes in product mix or capacity utilization  personnel changes  production delays  seasonality and other factors affecting sales and results of operations 
international exposure 
the company has manufacturing operations located in asia and distribution operations in asia  europe  and latin america 
the company s operations are subject to the impact of economic downturns  political instability  and foreign trade restrictions  which may adversely affect the financial results 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net sales in the foreseeable future 
some sales by the foreign operations are in local currency and an increase in the relative value of the us dollar against such currencies would lead to the reduction in consolidated sales and earnings 
additionally  foreign currency exposures are not fully hedged and there can be no assurances that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
dependence on key customers 
the company s growth is strongly influenced by the growth of its key customers  many of which are large restaurant chains 
the number of new store openings by these chains can vary from quarter to quarter depending on internal growth plans  construction  seasonality and other factors 
if these chains were to conclude that the market for their type of restaurant had become saturated  they could open fewer restaurants 
in addition  during an economic downturn  key customers could both open fewer restaurants and defer purchases of new equipment for existing restaurants 
either of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
while no single customer accounts for more than of net sales  the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal competition 
the cooking and warming segment of the foodservice equipment industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
within a given product line  the industry remains fairly concentrated  with typically a small number of competitors accounting for the bulk of the industry wide sales 
industry competition includes companies that manufacture a broad line of commercial foodservice equipment products and those that specialize in a particular product line 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some competitors have different pricing structures and may be able to deliver their products at lower prices 
although the company believes that the performance and price characteristics of its products will provide competitive solutions for its customers needs  there can be no assurance that its customers will choose the company s products over products offered by competitors 
further  the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company is aware of other companies that are developing  and in some cases have introduced  new ovens based on high speed heating methods and technologies 
accordingly  the company s ability to compete successfully will depend  in large part  on its ability to enhance and improve its existing products 
product liability matters 
the company is engaged in a business that could expose it to possible liability claims from others  including foodservice operators and their staffs  as well as from consumers  for personal injury or property damage due to alleged design or manufacturing defects in the company s products 
the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy to cover claims up to million per occurrence 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that an adequate level of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a partially insured or a completely uninsured successful claim against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks relating to intellectual property 
the company holds numerous patents covering technology and applications related to various products  equipment and systems  and numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the us patent and trademark office and in various foreign countries  including the names ctx  middleby marshall  southbend  steammaster  and toastmaster 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that existing or future patents or trademarks may afford the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends significantly on certain of its executive officers and certain other key personnel  many of whom could be difficult to replace 
the incapacity  inability or unwillingness of certain of these people to perform their services may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations
