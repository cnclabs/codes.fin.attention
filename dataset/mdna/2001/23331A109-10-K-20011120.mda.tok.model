table of contents inflation the company and the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation also increases the company s financing  labor and material costs

the company attempts to pass through to its customers any increases in its costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations 
safe harbor statement certain statements contained in this report  as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission  statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements made by company officials to analysts  stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about the company  may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other reports or public statements of the company may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements 
the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us 
other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us 
general economic  real estate and other conditions the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
any oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding  the availability and cost of materials and labor  adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns 
increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing 
any future increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less affordable 
governmental regulations and environmental matters we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and homebuilding process  including zoning  density and building standards 
such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays  increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas 
substantial debt we have a significant amount of debt 
the amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other requirements 
it could also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 
competitive conditions the homebuilding industry is very competitive 
in each of the markets we serve  we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers  desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  the need for increased selling incentives  lower sales or delays in construction 

table of contents availability of capital our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to obtain capital from the sale of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings 
increases in interest rates  changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies  concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy  changing lending objectives of financial institutions  or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future 
growth strategies since  we have acquired and successfully integrated many homebuilding companies 
in the future  we may acquire additional companies 
our prospects may be affected by our ability to successfully identify and integrate future acquisitions 
our prospects may also be affected by our ability to implement successfully our growth strategies in the markets we currently serve 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt 
the company monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and utilizes both fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the company has mitigated its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings 
the company generally does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on the company s fixed rate debt until such time as the company is required to refinance  repurchase or repay such debt 
the company s interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
when it was adopted on october  since their maturities and other terms did not match the related debt  they were determined to be ineffective hedges as defined by the statement 
therefore  the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  since any such changes must be reflected in the company s income statements 
the company s financial services segment is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan production activities 
mortgage loans are funded at fixed interest rates before they are committed to specific investors and interest rate lock commitments irlc s are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of funded loans 
the effectiveness of the fair value hedge is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness  which for the year ended september   was not significant  is recognized in current earnings 
the irlc s are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
interest rate risk associated with irlc s is managed through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities and the purchase of options on financial instruments 
these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
at september   total forward commitments to mitigate interest rate risk related to funded loans and irlc s were approximately million  the duration of which was less than six months 
the following table sets forth  as of september   the company s long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value
