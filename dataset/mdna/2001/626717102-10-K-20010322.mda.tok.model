vs 
excluding special items  income in totaled a company record million  a diluted share 
the results for represented a million improvement compared to income of million  a diluted share  before special items in the improvement primarily arose from record earnings from the company s exploration and production operations  which amounted to million in compared to million in higher sales prices for both crude oil and natural gas were the principal reasons behind the higher exploration and production earnings 
the company s average worldwide sales price for crude oil and condensate was a barrel in and a barrel in the average sales price of north american natural gas improved from a thousand cubic feet mcf in to in earnings from refining  marketing and transportation operations increased from million in to million in these results improved due to better unit margins in both the united states and the united kingdom 
the costs of corporate activities  which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  excluding special items  compared to million in the million reduction in was primarily due to lower net interest costs and lower compensation expense for awards under the company s stock based incentive plans 
vs 
excluding special items  income in totaled million  a share  an increase of million from the million earned in the increase in income was primarily attributable to stronger earnings from exploration and production operations  which totaled million in compared to million in this improvement was partially offset by lower earnings from refining  marketing and transportation operations  which earned million in  down from million earned in the improvement in exploration and production earnings in was primarily attributable to an increase of a barrel in the average worldwide crude oil sales price  up compared to  and record crude oil production 
in addition  the company s worldwide natural gas sales volume and us natural gas sales prices both increased in refining  marketing and transportation operations were adversely affected by the increase in the prices of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks 
this segment s decline in earnings was primarily attributable to lower us operating results  as rising crude oil prices squeezed margins throughout most of the year 
the costs of corporate and other activities were million in compared to million in the increase in was principally due to higher net interest costs and higher costs of awards under the company s incentive plans

the company s earnings were also favorably affected by higher sales prices for its north american natural gas production 
production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids decreased in  and natural gas sales volumes fell as declines in the us gulf of mexico more than offset higher oil and gas sales volumes in canada 
higher exploration expenses in partially offset the effects of higher commodity prices 
total oil production in was a company record due primarily to production from new fields in the united kingdom and canada

crude oil and liquids production in the united states declined in  following a increase in the reduction in was primarily due to declines from existing fields in the gulf of mexico 
oil production in canada increased in to a record volume of  barrels a day 
production at hibernia rose  barrels a day due to improved operations 
heavy oil production in western canada was  barrels a day higher in due primarily to an active drilling program in the early part of the year 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation in canada was down  barrels a day in due to a combination of more downtime for maintenance and a higher net profit royalty caused by higher prices 
before royalties  the company s synthetic oil production was  barrels a day in   in and  in production of light oil in canada decreased barrels a day in uk production increased by barrels a day in as improved volumes at mungo monan and schiehallion were almost offset by declines at more mature fields in the north sea 
production in ecuador was down barrels a day in due to transportation constraints 
when compared to oil production  volumes were up barrels a day in the united states  while production at hibernia was up  synthetic oil production was up and uk production was  higher 
production of heavy oil in western canada fell barrels a day in  light oil declined  and production in ecuador was down the increase in the united states was due to new production from several small fields in the gulf of mexico 
hibernia was improved due to more stabilized operations achieved during the latter half of synthetic oil production was up due to higher gross production  partially offset by a higher net profit royalty rate caused by higher prices 
heavy oil production was lower in because of selective field shut ins due to low prices during the early part of the year 
the improvement in the united kingdom in was due to a full year of operations at mungo monan and schiehallion  both of which commenced production in the third quarter of the decline in ecuador production in was due to pipeline restrictions 
worldwide sales of natural gas averaged million cubic feet a day in  million in and million in sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet a day in  million in and million in the reduction in was due to reduced deliverability from maturing fields in the gulf of mexico 
the increase in was mainly due to sales from several new fields in the gulf of mexico that more than offset declining production from other fields 
natural gas sales in canada in were at record levels for the fifth consecutive year as sales increased to million cubic feet a day 
canadian natural gas sales had increased in the increase in was primarily due to production from new discoveries in western canada  plus production obtained through the acquisition of beau canada exploration ltd 
beau canada in november 
natural gas sales in the united kingdom were million cubic feet a day in  down million compared to uk natural gas sales in were essentially unchanged from levels 
worldwide crude oil sales prices continued to strengthen through much of following a solid improvement in in the united states  murphy s average monthly sales prices for crude oil and condensate ranged from a barrel to a barrel  and averaged for the year  above the average price of 
in canada  the average sales price for light oil was a barrel in  an increase of 
heavy oil prices averaged a barrel  up compared to a year ago 
the average sales price for synthetic oil in was  up from the sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field increased to a barrel 
uk sales prices averaged higher in at a barrel 
sales prices in ecuador were a barrel in  up from a year earlier 
us oil prices increased in compared to in canada  crude oil prices in were up for light oil  for heavy oil  for synthetic oil  and for hibernia 
oil prices in the united kingdom were up in  and prices in ecuador were up 
worldwide oil prices showed signs of weakening in late and into early although the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec announced a production cut effective february   the company can make no assurances that oil prices will remain at or near year end prices of about a barrel for west texas intermediate grade crude oil 
north american natural gas sales prices strengthened as progressed due to supply being short of demand 
a combination of a hotter than normal summer and a colder than normal early winter near the end of in the united states strained an already below normal level of gas storage throughout the country 
average monthly natural gas sales prices in the united states in ranged from an mcf in january to in december 
for the year  us sales prices increased and averaged an mcf compared to in the average price for natural gas sold in canada during increased to an mcf  while prices in the united kingdom increased to 
average us natural gas sales prices were up in  and prices were up in canada by as canadian natural gas sales prices moved closer to parity with us prices during the year 
the average uk gas sales price in fell mainly as a result of a contractual price basis adjustment at the company s primary north sea gas field 
based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each a barrel and 
an mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining  marketing and transportation segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
cost per equivalent barrel during the last three years were as follows 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the united states in was attributable to a combination of lower production and higher well servicing costs 
the increase in canada  excluding synthetic oil  was due to an increase in well servicing costs at heavy oil properties offset in part by the effect of higher production at hibernia  where production expenses are lower than in western canada 
the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel for canadian synthetic oil in was due to lower gross production volumes and an increase in royalty barrels caused by higher oil prices 
based on the company s interest in syncrude s gross production  cost per barrel increased in a lower unit cost in the united kingdom in was due to a favorable impact from higher production at the lower cost mungo monan and schiehallion fields 
higher cost per barrel in ecuador in was attributable to both lower production and higher overall operating expenses 
the decrease in us production cost per equivalent barrel in was attributable to lower well servicing costs combined with higher production volumes 
the increase in canada in  excluding synthetic oil  was caused by higher well servicing costs at heavy oil properties 
the increase in the canadian synthetic oil unit rate was due to an increase in royalty barrels caused by higher sales prices 
the decrease in the uk rate was due to higher production from the lower cost mungo monan and schiehallion fields 
the higher cost in ecuador in was caused by higher field operating costs combined with lower production during the year 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditure totals for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploratory expenditures charged against income dry hole costs geological and geophysical costs other costs undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the increases in both and were due to higher production from the hibernia field  offshore eastern canada 
additionally  includes higher depreciation rates per unit on production from fields acquired from beau canada 
refining  marketing and transportation earnings from refining  marketing and transportation operations before special items were million in  million in and million in operations in the united states earned million in compared to a loss of million in  as product sales realizations increased more than the costs of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks 
us operations earned million in the decline in was due to the inability to fully recover higher costs of crude oil through increases in average product sales prices 
operations in the united kingdom earned million in  million in and million in the improvement in was also caused by a larger increase in the sales realizations for finished products than for the costs of refining feedstocks 
canadian operations contributed million to earnings compared to million in and million in unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil  other feedstocks  refining and transportation to point of sale averaged a barrel in the united states in  
in and in us product sales totaled a record  barrels a day in  up following an decline in the increase in was attributable to a combination of record crude oil throughputs at the company s us refineries plus continued expansion of retail gasoline operations at wal mart stores 
the decline in sales volumes in was primarily due to a turnaround at the meraux refinery early in the year 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged a barrel in  in and in sales of petroleum products were down in following an decrease in the volume decline in was attributable to lower consumer demand in the united kingdom caused by the large increase in product prices during the year 
the decline in was due to lower sales in the cargo market 
although unit margins improved in  the company s branded outlets still face competition from other motor fuel marketers 
unit margins have softened in early  and the company was experiencing weaker financial results in its uk downstream operations 
based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
a barrel 
a gallon fluctuation in unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
the improvement in the company s canadian downstream operating results in was due to higher pipeline throughputs after the acquisition of the minority interest in the manito pipeline system in mid year 
higher earnings in were attributable to improved operating results from crude oil trading and pipeline operations 
the company entered into an agreement to sell its canadian pipeline and trucking operation in special items net income for the last three years included certain special items reviewed in the following paragraphs

charge resulting from cancellation of a drilling rig contract an after tax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from cancellation of a drilling rig contract for the terra nova oil field  offshore eastern canada 
the contract was cancelled because market conditions allowed a more efficient and modern rig to be obtained  thus reducing drilling costs for the terra nova project compared to what they might otherwise have been 

write down of crude oil inventories to market value an after tax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of to establish a valuation allowance to reduce the carried amount of crude oil inventories in the united kingdom and canada to market values 

settlement of uk long term sales contract an after tax gain of million was recorded in the second quarter of related to settlement of a uk long term sales contract 

cumulative effect of accounting change an after tax charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of to carry the company s unsold crude oil production at cost rather than at market value as in the past

total us and us refining expenditures during the three years were primarily for capital projects to keep the refineries operating efficiently and within industry standards and to study alternatives for meeting anticipated future environmentally driven changes to us motor fuel specifications 
marketing expenditures in the united states primarily included the costs of new stations built on land leased from wal mart  and improvements and normal replacements at existing stations and terminals 
uk marketing expenditures in were primarily for redevelopment of shops and station purchases  expenditures in and were primarily for improvements and normal replacements at existing stations and terminals

the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
current financing arrangements are set forth in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect any problem in meeting future requirements for funds 
murphy had commitments of million for capital projects in progress at december   including million related to a clean fuels expansion project at the meraux refinery and million related to the company s multiyear contract for a semisubmersible deepwater drilling rig 
certain costs committed under the rig contract will be charged to murphy s partners when future deepwater wells are drilled 
environmental the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect the environment and or impose remedial obligations 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including refineries  oil and gas fields  service stations  and terminals  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s reserve for remedial obligations  which is included in deferred credits and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  contains certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the amount reserved by up to an estimated million 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency epa that it is currently considered a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites and has also been assigned responsibility by defendants at another superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the four sites 
the company does not expect that its related remedial costs will be material to its financial condition or its results of operations  and it has not provided a reserve for remedial costs on superfund sites 
additional information may become known in the future that would alter this assessment  including any requirement to bear a pro rate share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or indications of additional responsibility by the company 
lawsuits filed against murphy by the us government and the state of wisconsin are discussed under the caption legal proceedings on page of this form k report 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a future period 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
these costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
if crude oil and natural gas sales prices remain strong  the company believes that the future prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected 
accounting matters the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
subsequent to the issuance of sfas no 
 the fasb received many requests to review and clarify certain implementation issues 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amended certain provisions of sfas no 
effective january   murphy must recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
a derivative instrument meeting certain conditions may be designated as a hedge of a specific exposure  accounting for changes in a derivative s fair value will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
changes in a derivative s fair value for a qualifying hedge of a forecasted transactions will be deferred and recorded as a component of other accumulated comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet until the forecasted transaction occurs  at which time the derivative s value will be recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions of a hedging derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
transition adjustments resulting from adopting this statement will be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
as described under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page of this form k report  the company makes limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific market risks 
the company has determined that the adoption of sfas will increase other comprehensive income by approximately million and the overall effect on net income from adoption of this standard will not be significant 
as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements  the company has adopted a change in accounting for unsold crude oil production effective january   and also has retroactively applied two consensuses of the fasb emerging issue task force to and all prior years presented 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
during and most of  increased worldwide demand and disciplined management of supply by the world s producers primarily by members of opec led to stronger oil prices 
during late and early  crude oil sales prices weakened slightly 
in mid january  opec announced a reduction in crude oil production beginning february  and light sweet crude oil for march delivery sold for more than a barrel at that date 
the company can give no assurance that the price of crude oil will remain at this high level during the remainder of and beyond 
due to colder than normal weather across much of north america during the early winter of  the price of natural gas remained well above its normal trading range in january the company can give no assurance that the price of natural gas will remain at or above its normal trading range in the future 
the company s uk refining and marketing operations were experiencing weaker unit margins in early in such a volatile operating environment  constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for expenditures of million 
of this amount  million or  is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  including million for development of deepwater projects in the gulf of mexico  another is allocated to canada  including million for continued development of the terra nova oil field  which is currently scheduled for start up late in  and million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations  is allocated to the united kingdom  is allocated to ecuador  and is allocated to other foreign operations  which primarily includes malaysia 
planned refining  marketing and transportation capital expenditures for are million  including million in the united states  million in the united kingdom and million in canada 
us amounts include funds to build additional stations at wal mart sites  as well as early spending for green fuel projects at the meraux refinery 
capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect changes in estimated cash flow during forward looking statements this form k report  including documents incorporated by reference herein  contains statements of the company s expectations  intentions  plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the company s control 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors  including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the company s january  form k report on file with the us securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
at december   the company was a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
these swaps mature in and the swaps require the company to pay an average interest rate of over their composite lives  and at december   the interest rate to be received by the company averaged 
the variable interest rate received by the company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly 
the company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was a loss of million at december  at december   of the company s debt had variable interest rates and was denominated in canadian dollars 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would reduce the company s interest expense by 
million in after a 
million favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps 
a increase in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would increase interest expense in by 
million and increase current maturities of long term debt by 
million for debt denominated in canadian dollars 
at december   murphy was a party to natural gas price swap agreements for a total notional volume of million mmbtu that are intended to reduce a portion of the financial exposure of its meraux  louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchased for fuel in through in each month of settlement  the swaps require murphy to pay an average natural gas price of an mmbtu and to receive the average nymex henry hub price for the final three trading days of the month 
at december   the estimated fair value of these agreements was a gain of million  a fluctuation in the average nymex henry hub price of natural gas would have changed the estimated year end fair value of these swaps by million 
at december   murphy was also a party to certain natural gas swap agreements for a total notional volume of  gigajoules gj a day through october that are intended to reduce a portion of the financial exposure of its canadian natural gas production to changes in natural gas sales prices 
in each month  the swaps require murphy to pay the aeco c index price and to receive an average of c per gj 
the company also has a natural gas swap agreement for the purchase of  gj per day through october that requires murphy to pay c per gj and to receive based on the aeco c index 
at december   the estimated net fair value of these agreements was a liability of million  a fluctuation in the average price of the aeco c index would have changed the estimated year end fair value of these swaps by million
