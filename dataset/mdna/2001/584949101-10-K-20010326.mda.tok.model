item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national provider of medical transcription services 
substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from the provision of medical transcription services  which we recognize when we render services and deliver reports 
we also derive an insignificant amount of revenue from services other than traditional transcription services  such as coding revenue  interfacing fees  equipment rentals  equipment sales  referral fees and commissions from strategic partners 
fees for medical transcription services are based primarily on contracted rates and revenue is recognized upon the rendering of services and delivery of transcribed reports 
revenues from other sources are recognized when earned 
for purposes of our discussion and analysis of our results of operations we distinguish our revenue growth as core growth and growth from large acquisitions 
core growth includes revenue from all of the above sources and revenue from acquisitions with annual sales under million  prior to the date of acquisition 
revenues arising from acquisitions having annual revenue in excess of million  prior to the date of acquisition  is discussed separately in our analysis of revenue growth 
cost of revenue consists of all direct costs associated with providing transcription related services  including payroll  telecommunications  repairs and maintenance  rent and other direct costs 
most of our cost of revenue is variable in nature  but includes certain fixed components 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our senior executive management  marketing  accounting  legal and other administrative functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses are mostly fixed in nature  but include certain variable components
