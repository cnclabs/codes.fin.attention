item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview miller is an independent oil and gas exploration  development and production company that has developed a base of producing properties and inventory of prospects concentrated primarily in mississippi 
the company was organized in connection with the combination transaction 
the combined assets consist of moc  interests in oil and natural gas properties from the affiliated entities and interests in such properties owned by certain business partners and investors 
the combination transaction closed on february  in connection with the closing of the offering 
the offering  including the sale of an additional  shares of common stock by the company on march  pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after expenses 
for further discussion of the offering and the combination transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
sec regulation s x  rule requires companies reporting on a full cost basis to apply a ceiling test wherein the capitalized costs within the full cost pool  net of deferred income taxes  may not exceed the net present value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves plus the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
any such excess costs should be charged against earnings 
on december   the common stockholders of the company approved certain transactions with guardian and eagle that  among other things  required the company to record non cash interest expense in the aggregate of approximately million during the year ended december  these transactions are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and average costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the periods presented in thousands  except per unit amounts year ended december  production volumes crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf    natural gas equivalent mmcfe    revenues natural gas    crude oil and condensate    operating expenses lease operating expenses and production taxes    depletion  depreciation and amortization

general and administrative year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million of hedging losses  respectively see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to declining production in the mississippi salt basin properties 
the company installed compressors on all company operated properties in the salt basin and have reperforated and conducted other stimulation techniques to boost and or stabilize production rates 
the company will continue to evaluate wells for various workover projects which will be funded by the company s operating cash flows 
the effect on natural gas production of the sale of the company s antrim shale properties in michigan and certain non strategic producing properties in louisiana and texas in early have been offset by increased production from non antrim shale production in the michigan basin during average natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  due to improved natural gas commodity prices during oil production volumes decreased to mbbls for the year ended december  compared to mbbls the same period of decreased production in the mississippi salt basin accounted for of the change with the remaining decline being attributable to the sale of producing properties in louisiana and texas in early and in june the company believes the installation of compressors in mid and the ongoing evaluation of the company s producing wells for additional stimulation potential will help to slow production decline rates 
average oil prices increased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  as oil commodity prices rebounded in lease operating expenses loe and production taxes for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  loe increased to million for compared to million for this increase is comprised of a million increase in expenses attributable to mississippi salt basin wells and a decrease in expenses resulting from the sale of producing properties in michigan  louisiana and texas during and compressor installation and related rental expenses and the costs of various reperforation and well stimulation projects account for the increased loe on the salt basin properties 
production taxes increased to million for compared to million for substantially all of this increase is attributable to the salt basin properties 
since june  the average crude oil and natural gas prices exceeded the price ceiling established by the state of mississippi  therefore exemption from the production tax established by mississippi statute no longer applied 
also  since the mississippi production tax is calculated by taking of the gross value of the crude oil and natural gas  the upward trend in the amount of production tax expense followed the substantial increase in commodity prices that occurred during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease is attributable to the cost reduction plan implemented in may the primary components of the general and administrative expense reduction include  a million decrease in salaries  wages  and related employee benefits  a million decrease in legal and professional fees  and a million decrease in travel expenses 
these decreases were offset by a million reduction in the amount of capitalized general and administrative expenses in using unescalated period end prices at december  of per mcfe  the company had no impairment of oil and gas properties 
using unescalated period end prices at december   of per mcfe  the company would have recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of approximately million pre tax 
however  on the basis of the improvement in pricing experienced subsequent to period end of per mcfe in march  the company determined that a writedown was not required 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to million of non cash interest expense that was required to be recorded in connection with the guardian convertible note payable and the issuance of common stock warrants to guardian  more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
had the million interest expense entry not been required  interest expense would have actually decreased by to million from million 
this decrease is attributable to a reduction in total debt to million at december  from million at december  and the lower interest rate provided for under the credit facility agreement with the company s new lender  bank one  texas  na bank one 
on july   the company entered into a senior credit facility with bank one which replaced the existing credit facility with bank of montreal 
in connection with extinguishment of the debt with bank of montreal  the company reported an extraordinary loss  net of income taxes of million for the remaining unamortized debt expenses 
net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million of hedging losses gains  respectively see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the sales of the company s antrim shale gas properties in michigan and certain non strategic properties in texas and louisiana that occurred earlier in the combined proceeds from these property sales amounted to million of which million was applied to the company s outstanding debt balance 
the decrease in natural gas production volumes attributable to these sold properties was partially offset by a increase in natural gas produced from the mississippi salt basin properties for the year ended december  compared to the same period of average natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  due to improved natural gas commodity prices during the third and fourth quarters of despite an increase in oil production volumes for the mississippi salt basin properties  total oil production for the year ended december  increased only to mbbls from mbbls for the year ended december  reduced oil production attributable to sold properties in texas and louisiana offset the production increases from the mississippi salt basin properties 
average oil prices increased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  as oil commodity prices rebounded in the third and fourth quarters of lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily comprised of an approximate million reduction in loe attributable to properties in texas  louisiana and michigan that were sold in savings of approximately million in compared to resulted from fewer well workovers in compared to and more efficient use of the company s field operations personnel and much less dependence on contract pumping services 
there was also an approximate million decrease in production taxes associated with the sale of producing properties in  partially offset by a million increase in taxes attributable to new wells in mississippi and michigan that commenced initial production during dd a expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  of million was unchanged from the same period in although general and administrative expense actually decreased by million for compared to due to a cost reduction plan implemented in may  fees received as reimbursement of general and administrative expense costs also decreased by million  leaving reported general and administrative expense for the year ended december  unchanged from the level reported for the same period of the prior year 
using unescalated period end prices at december   of per mcfe  the company would have recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of approximately million pre tax 
however  on the basis of the improvement in pricing experienced subsequent to period end  the company determined that a writedown was not required 
at december   the company recorded a non cash cost ceiling writedown of million 
the writedown was the combined result of a large downward revision in oil and gas reserve quantities and depressed commodity prices 
the large bcfe downward revision of the company s proved oil and gas reserves at december  was comprised of a bcfe reduction in proved undeveloped reserves as a result of unsuccessful drilling activity and a bcfe reduction in proved producing reserves 
proved producing reserves decreased as a result of unanticipated pressure and production declines and by a reduction in the economic lives of producing reserves caused by the lower commodity prices being realized at december  disappointing d seismic supported drilling results during and drilling cost overruns on two non operated properties also contributed to the cost ceiling writedown 
the company based its ceiling test determination on a price of per mcfe  which represented the march closing commodity prices 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this substantial interest expense increase is attributable to a higher average debt level in compared to  due to substantial d seismic acquisition costs  and exploration and development activity in the third and fourth quarters of that increased the outstanding debt balance 
also contributing to higher interest expense in was the interest expense associated with the veritas note payable  more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the prime plus interest rate that became effective with the second amendment to the credit facility agreement dated april   compared to the previous libor based rate effective during net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided in compared to was primarily attributable to improved operating results because of the significantly increased commodity prices in and to drilling advances received from joint interest partners relating to the drilling of wells 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to was principally due to the reduced payables in because of an effort by the company to more effectively manage our cash flow requirements  including processing of payables on a more timely basis 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to a million decrease in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties offset by a decrease in exploration and development expenditures of million 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was principally due to an increase in property sales of million in  a decrease in exploration and development expenditures of million in and a decrease in the acquisition of properties of million in net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily a result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by a reduction in net borrowings on long term debt 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to was primarily a result of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering in and a reduction in net borrowings in capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of capital have been funds generated by operations  and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
concurrently with the offering  a credit facility was entered into with bank of montreal  houston agency 
the credit facility  as amended  required principal reductions and included certain negative covenants that imposed limitations on the company and its subsidiary with respect to  among other things  distributions with respect to our capital stock  limitations on financial ratios  the creation or incurrence of liens  restrictions on proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  making loans and investments and mergers and consolidations 
the company s obligations under the credit facility were secured by a lien on all of its real and personal property 
commencing april  the interest rate under this facility was increased to bank of montreal s prime plus 
on july   the company entered into a new senior credit facility with bank one  which replaced the existing credit facility with bank of montreal 
the new credit facility has a month term with an interest rate under the new credit facility is either bank one prime plus or libor plus  at the company s option 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on all of its real and personal property 
the new credit facility required the company to make monthly principal payments of  from august  until the borrowing base re determination that occurred on january  the new borrowing base determined by bank one as of december  is million  less the amount due amerada hess corporation ahc in the next scheduled borrowing base re determination with bank one is in july the company made principal payments of approximately million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively  under the credit facility with bank of montreal and bank one 
at december   the outstanding debt balance under the company s credit facility with bank one was million 
the bank one credit facility includes certain negative covenants that impose restrictions on us with respect to  among other things  incurrence of additional indebtedness  limitations on financial ratios  making investments and mergers and consolidation 
on april   the company issued a million note payable to one of its suppliers  veritas dgc land  inc the veritas note  for the outstanding balance due to veritas for past services provided in and the principal obligation under the veritas note was originally due on april  on july   the note was amended as more fully described below 
on april   the company also entered into an agreement the warrant agreement to issue warrants to veritas that entitle veritas to purchase shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash payments for the accrued interest obligations under the veritas note 
the warrant agreement required the company to issue warrants to veritas in conjunction with the signing of the warrant agreement  as well as on the six and  at the company s option  and month anniversaries of the warrant agreement 
the warrants issued equal of the then current outstanding principal balance of the veritas note 
the number of shares issued upon exercise of the warrants issued on april   and on the six month anniversary was determined based upon a five day weighted average closing price of the company s common stock at april  the exercise price of each warrant is per share 
on april   warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock were issued to veritas in connection with execution of the veritas note 
on october  and april   warrants exercisable for another  and  shares  respectively  of common stock were issued to veritas 
the company ratably recognizes the prepaid interest into expense over the period to which it relates 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized non cash interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  related to the veritas note payable 
the warrant agreement was also amended on july  under the terms of the amended note and warrant agreements  the maturity of the veritas note was extended from april  to july  and the expiration date for all warrants issued was extended until june  the annual interest rate has been reduced from to  provided the entire note balance is paid in full by december  if all principal and interest under the veritas note is not paid by december   then the note bears interest at until paid in full 
as of december   the company has only recognized interest expense on the outstanding veritas note at since it is believed that the principal balance will be paid in full by december  interest accrues at the reduced rate from and after october  and is payable commencing april  and continuing on each october and april until principal is paid in full 
interest was required to be paid in warrants under the terms of the warrant agreement until the company is in compliance with the net borrowing base formula as defined in the bank one credit facility agreement  at which time interest will only be paid in cash 
under the amended veritas note  a principal payment of  was made on july   the effective date of the amendment  and another  payment was made in december the balance due veritas was million at december  with the entire balance classified as long term in the accompanying financial statements 
any additional proceeds derived from the exercise of warrants issued or from other debt or equity transactions must be used to pay interest and principal on the amended veritas note until paid in full 
effective november   veritas exercised  warrants to receive  shares net of exercise price of company common stock 
in connection with the closing of the ahc property acquisition on february   the company issued a non interest bearing note payable to ahc the ahc note 
the company had obtained a six month extension of the million payment due ahc from february to august this payment was made on august  also  the million payment due february has been divided into three quarterly installments of  each  payable commencing february a substantial portion of the first quarter payment was made in december refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding capital resources  specifically the guardian and eagle transactions in at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million excluding the current portion of long term debt 
management plans to meet these working capital requirements from operational cash flows 
the company anticipates capital expenditures will be approximately million 
capital expenditures will be used to fund drilling and development activities  the acquisition of additional seismic data and processing and leasehold acquisitions and extensions in the company s project areas 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures and number of wells drilled may differ significantly from such estimates 
actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million 
the company also acquired undeveloped oil and gas properties valued for financial reporting purposes at million from eagle in exchange for shares of the company s common stock and warrants  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company intends to fund its budgeted capital expenditures through operational cash flow 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  substantially are dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
the company cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
a return to the significantly lower oil and gas prices experienced in and early  as compared to historical averages  would likely have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements primarily due to the company s active exploration and development program 
while the company believes that cash flow from operations and improved commodity prices should allow the company to implement its present business strategy through  additional debt or equity financing may be required during the remainder of and in the future to fund the company s growth  development and exploration program  and to satisfy its existing obligations 
the failure to obtain and exploit such capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company  including further curtailment of its exploration and other activities 
risk management activities and derivative transactions the company uses a variety of derivative instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
to qualify for hedge accounting  derivatives must meet the following criteria i the item to be hedged exposes the company to price or interest rate risk  and ii the derivative reduces that exposure and is designated as a hedge 
commodity price hedges the company periodically enters into certain derivatives eg  nymex futures contracts for a portion of its oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce the exposure to price fluctuations 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit potential gains from future increases in prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
for financial reporting purposes  gains and losses related to hedging are recognized as oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedge transactions occur 
the company expects that the amount of hedge contracts that it has in place will vary from time to time 
for the years ended december    and  the company hedged   and of its oil and gas production  respectively  and as of december   the company had bcfe of open oil and natural gas contracts for the months of january through december refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of price risk management and derivative activities 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  amended by statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and statement no 
 accounting for certain derivatives and certain hedging activities hereinafter collectively referred to as sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
has been adopted by the company as of january  and the company has completed the process of identifying all derivative instruments  determining fair market values of derivatives designating and documenting hedge relationships  and evaluating the effectiveness of those hedge relationships 
certain financial derivative contracts used to hedge the price risk on future production qualify under the provisions of sfas no 
as cash flow hedges 
these contracts are required to be recognized at their fair value in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability 
management estimates that the effect of adopting sfas no 
as of january  would increase liabilities by approximately million with a corresponding decrease in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of equity since the contracts outstanding on the date meet the specific hedge accounting criteria 
approximately million of the million amount represents the liability estimated for the contracts settling in the first quarter of the amount of hedge loss actually realized on these contracts settled in the first quarter of was million 
management estimates that the liability and corresponding balance of other comprehensive income that would be reported in the consolidated statement of equity is approximately million as of march effects of inflation and changes in price crude oil and natural gas commodity prices have been volatile and unpredictable during  and  with crude oil prices falling below per bbl and rising close to per bbl  and natural gas prices dropping below per mcf and then climbing up above per mcf during this two year time period 
these wide fluctuations have had a significant impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
recent rates of inflation have had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed thereby frequently change and become subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk information the market risk inherent in the company s derivatives is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the prices of oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by the market fluctuations  the company s policy is to hedge through the use of derivatives future production 
because commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company sells in the physical market  no special correlation studies other than monitoring the degree of convergence between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
the changes in market value of these derivatives have a high correlation to the price changes of oil and natural gas 
a sensitivity analysis model was used to calculate the fair values of the company s derivatives rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis involved increasing or decreasing the forward rates by a hypothetical and calculating the resulting unfavorable change in the fair values of the derivatives 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  showed this type of change would not have a material impact on the fair value of the derivatives previously stated as discussed in the new accounting standard section above
