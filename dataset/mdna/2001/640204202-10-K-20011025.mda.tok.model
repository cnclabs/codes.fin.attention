sales were soft across all regions  particularly at manhattan based bergdorf goodman 
there can be no assurances that the decreases in sales subsequent to september  will not continue for the remainder of fiscal year and beyond 
further  the company s ability to mitigate the impacts of declines in sales in the short term is negatively impacted by several factors  including but not limited to  the time interval between the ordering and delivery of the company s seasonal merchandise and the advance production requirements associated with the company s catalogues 
these factors could result in  among other things  a higher level of inventory markdowns being required in the remainder of fiscal to liquidate fall season merchandise  both goods currently on hand as well as goods yet to be delivered  and spring season merchandise previously ordered pursuant to noncancelable purchase commitments
