item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the meridian resource corporation is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations primarily focused in the onshore and offshore south louisiana and southeast texas gulf coast region 
as an integral part of our business strategy  we take a very disciplined approach to each project incorporating d seismic analysis of every prospective area prior to drilling a first well 
we place emphasis on employing every technological tool available to evaluate each prospect prior to commencing drilling 
as of december   meridian s reserves totaled bcfe  representing a decrease of from year end  with a present value of future net cash flows before income taxes of  million  an increase of million  or  over year end  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
production volumes for the year were bcfe as compared to bcfe for  a increase after accounting for the sale of non core properties  which resulted in a reduction of bcfe in reserves 
we had discoveries and extensions that added bcfe during the year  partially offset by bcfe of revisions of prior reserve estimates 
our reserves have an average reserve life of six years and are approximately natural gas with being proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
in addition to the proved reserves  meridian holds  net undeveloped acres   net developed acres  rights and licenses to over  square miles of d seismic data and access to over  miles of d seismic data 
we believe that we are in a strong position relative to others in our industry who compete in the south louisiana and southeast texas onshore transition zone region 
this advantage stems primarily from our technical and professional staff and its experience in exploring for and producing oil and natural gas in our focus area  our large land and seismic inventories  which form the foundation of the company s future prospects and growth  and our experienced approach to the development of original prospects and the understanding of what works best technically in our region 
because of the shell acquisition and merger  we are now in a better position to balance the allocation of capital expenditures between our exploration activities and development exploitation activities  which provides us with greater flexibility during the volatile price environments we have experienced in the past 
the same holds true for calendar year and the projects currently scheduled for drilling 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
in this regard  average worldwide oil and natural gas prices have increased substantially from levels existing during as a result of these increases  the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  these industry conditions  and any continuation thereof  will have several important consequences to us  including the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
shell transactions 
on june   we acquired the lopi transaction louisiana onshore properties inc lopi  an indirect subsidiary of shell  pursuant to a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with lopi 
the consideration paid in the lopi transaction consisted of  shares of our common stock and a new issue of convertible preferred stock that was convertible into  shares of common stock  which together provided shell louisiana onshore properties inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell slopi  with beneficial ownership of of our common stock on a fully diluted basis assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants and conversion of all preferred stock 
in a transaction separate from the lopi transaction  on june   we also acquired from shell western e p inc  an indirect subsidiary of shell swepi  various other oil and gas property interests located onshore in south louisiana for a total cash consideration of million the swepi acquisition 
the lopi transaction and the swepi acquisition together  the shell transactions were effected to substantially increase our reserves  lease acreage positions and exploration prospects in louisiana 
the shell transactions were accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  operations relating to the shell properties are included in our results of operations beginning with the third quarter of on january   we completed the repurchase of all of the outstanding preferred stock convertible into million shares of common stock and six million shares of our common stock from shell for million 
the repurchase of these shares resulted in an immediate reduction in the fully diluted share count of more than 
the company accumulated the million required to exercise the option to buy back the company s preferred stock and six million shares of common stock through a balanced financing structure including million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock at per share  million of excess cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non core properties  and million in subordinated debt 
ceiling test write down 
during and  crude oil and natural gas prices were significantly improved over therefore  we recorded no write down of the value of our oil and natural gas properties 
a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices was the primary cause of our recognition of million of non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting during due to the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that future write downs will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
oil and natural gas revenues increased million as a result of improved commodity prices and increased production volumes 
the production increase  net of reductions from property sales and natural declines  was a direct result of the inclusion of new wells being placed on production and an aggressive workover program during the year the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   interest and other income 
interest and other income increased million to million in  compared to million for this increase was primarily due to invested funds from the sale of properties and the common stock offering 
these funds were being accumulated for the amount required to exercise the option to buy back the company s preferred stock and six million shares of the company s common stock from shell 
operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this net increase was the result of several factors 
to take advantage of higher commodity prices  the company pursued an expanded well workover program to increase production during the year  however  these marginal wells incur higher lifting costs 
we implemented a cost reduction program to reduce the operating costs on several properties  and this partially offset the increase in costs from the expanded workovers on marginal wells 
additional factors included the expense incurred in bringing new reserves on production  which was partially offset by the property sales which included several wells with high operating costs 
the net impact of these various factors was an increase in operating expenses when viewed year over year 
on an mcfe basis  operating expenses were per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase is largely attributable to the increase in natural gas production over the same period in and the increase in the average sales price of oil over meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and is therefore  subject to a tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf effective in july depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of the increase in production on an mcfe basis over the comparable period in and an increase in the depletion rate  reflecting the movement of million for the year from the unevaluated to the full cost pool subject to depletion  the sale of non core properties and revisions of prior reserve estimates 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of our expanded exploration and production activities  costs included additional salaries  wages and other compensation and related employee expenses and increased rent related expenses  partially offset by a decrease in franchise taxes  legal expenses and other related administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily a result of the issuance of the subordinated notes in june  and due to the federal reserve bank s increase during in overall interest rates  leading to an increase in the average interest rate on the credit facility  partially offset by a decrease in the balance outstanding on the credit facility to million 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  operating revenues and production 
oil and natural gas revenues increased million as a result of increased volumes and improved prices 
the production increase was a direct result of the inclusion of results for the entire year from the louisiana properties purchased from shell as compared to their inclusion for only six months for  as well as new wells being placed on production during the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the additional operating expenses related to increased production and the inclusion of costs and expenses from the shell properties for the full year as well as new wells brought on production in when viewed on a per unit basis  this reflects a decrease in operating costs to per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for this reduction was due to our efforts to reduce operating costs on all of our properties  especially those purchased from shell  which had a higher cost of operations associated with them upon assuming control on june  severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in meridian s oil and natural gas is primarily produced from south louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to louisiana s severance tax 
louisiana s severance tax rates were per mcf for natural gas and of gross oil revenue 
our severance tax increase of million was largely tied to the increase of oil and natural gas production over and the fact that our average oil price increased over depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the increased production in over levels 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increases in salaries  wages  other compensation and related employee costs associated with the increase in employees related to the shell properties acquisition and the development and exploitation opportunities associated with the properties and the d seismic surveys covering them 
in addition  because of increased oil and natural gas volumes and prices  the net profit interest distributions increased accordingly 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily a result of additional borrowings under the credit facility for the full year of versus only six months of  and the issuance in june of million of convertible subordinated notes  due june  these additional funds were utilized in our capital expenditures program to further the exploration and development activities during a period when many in the industry were not as active in their drilling programs and drilling and service costs were lower 
liquidity and capital resources working capital 
during  meridian s liquidity improved significantly 
capital expenditures were internally financed from the company s cash flow generated from operations 
meridian s unhedged position since july allowed us to take full advantage of strong commodity prices during the last six months of the year  contributing to high levels of cash flow 
in addition  meridian continued initiatives designed to increase liquidity and provide flexibility in our capital structure 
we completed the sale of certain non strategic assets resulting in cash proceeds of approximately million of which million was applied to debt reduction 
the company also sold  shares of common stock during  for net proceeds of approximately million to the company 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million and working capital of million 
this improvement in working capital demonstrates our commitment to de levering the balance sheet by using available cash flow to reduce payables and other debt 
our strategy is to grow the company prudently  taking advantage of the strong asset base built over the years to add reserves through the drill bit while maintaining a disciplined approach to costs 
where appropriate  we will allocate excess cash above capital expenditures to reduce leverage 
credit facility 
we entered into an amended and restated credit facility with the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent the credit facility to provide for maximum borrowings  subject to borrowing base limitations  of up to million 
due to the property sales during  the borrowing base was reduced to million 
the company is currently negotiating its scheduled borrowing base redetermination with its banks 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by pledges of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries and a mortgage on the oil and natural gas properties of at least of its present value of proved properties 
the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends on the common stock 
borrowings under the credit facility mature on may  under the credit facility  as amended  we may secure either i an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  a certificate of deposit based rate or a federal funds based rate plus to or ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
the credit facility also provides for commitment fees ranging from to per annum 
short term note agreement 
we entered into a short term subordinated credit agreement with fortis capital corporation for million  effective january  the interest rate is libor plus 
the termination date is december  convertible subordinated notes 
during june  we completed private placements of an aggregate of million of our convertible subordinated notes due june  the notes 
the notes are unsecured and contain customary events of default  but do not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis 
the notes are convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of our common stock  utilizing a conversion price of per share the conversion price 
the conversion price is subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
the holders of the notes have been granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the notes or issuance of the warrants discussed below 
we may prepay the notes at any time without penalty or premium  however  if we redeem or prepay the notes on or before june   we will issue to the holders of the notes warrants to purchase that number of shares of common stock into which such notes would have been convertible on the date of prepayment 
the warrants will have exercise prices equal to the conversion price in effect on the date of issuance and will expire on june   regardless of the date such warrants are issued 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  and drilling and workover activities 
the company expanded workover activities to take advantage of high commodity prices 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory added to our daily production during a high commodity price environment 
this strategy brought on production and added reserves sooner than the drilling of deep  higher risk exploration wells 
the workover additions came from key producing fields  primarily west lake verret  weeks island  and good hope 
the capital expenditures plan has been established at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan primarily utilizing cash flow from operations 
where appropriate  we will use excess cash flow from operations as a result of increased rates or prices beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan to be used to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries or direct payment of debt 
sale of properties 
to reduce bank debt and increase liquidity  the company announced on january   the initiation of a formal process to pursue the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
as of december   seven transactions had been closed  covering a net total of bcfe for a total of approximately million  or an average price of mcfe 
of the property sale proceeds  million was used to reduce bank debt 
while additional non strategic properties may be sold  the company may elect to retain the properties if the expected earnings generated from continued operations exceeds the value of any offer for those properties 
there is no assurance that additional sales will take place or that the prices realized on any such sales will be comparable to previous property sales 
dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
the preferred stock issued upon closing of the lopi transaction accrued an annual cash dividend of of its stated value with the dividend ceasing to accrue incrementally on one third of the shares of preferred stock on june   and so that no dividends would have accrued on any shares of preferred stock after june  dividends on the preferred stock aggregating million were accrued for  of which million had been paid as of december  dividends were paid on a pro rata basis up until the exercise date of the option to purchase the preferred stock held by shell 
stock rights and restrictions agreement 
in june  meridian acquired substantially all of shell s onshore south louisiana oil and gas properties 
in consideration of the purchase  meridian issued to shell louisiana onshore properties  inc slopi  million shares of common stock plus preferred stock with a stated value of million 
the terms of the original stock rights and restrictions agreement allowed for the conversion of the preferred stock into common stock at any time and beginning july   and the potential for of shell s common stock holdings to be sold per year  each subsequent year 
meridian and slopi  on july   announced a definitive agreement granting meridian an option to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock convertible into million shares of common stock  plus six million shares of our common stock held by shell  for an aggregate cash price of million 
further  the agreement provided that shell would not dispose of any of its stock position until the latter part of april and any subsequent stock sales would be subject to rule of the securities act of as consideration for the option  we issued shell one million shares of our common stock 
the option and standstill agreement was exercised in a single transaction on january  after meridian exercised the option  shell remains meridian s largest shareholder  with approximately million shares of common stock 
the agreement is intended to benefit all shareholders  both by potentially reducing the number of outstanding shares and by eliminating the uncertainty resulting from the unknown amount of dilution related to the make whole provision of the preferred stock 
we believe that exercise of the option has simplified our capital structure 
forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  future capital expenditure plans  anticipated results from third party disputes and litigation  expectations regarding compliance with our credit facility  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following changes in the price of oil and natural gas 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the level of such production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors that we do not control  including seasonality  worldwide economic conditions  the condition of the united states economy particularly the manufacturing sector  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing countries  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
material declines in the prices received for oil and natural gas could make the actual results differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
operating risks 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas  including uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  pollution and environmental hazards  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
in addition  we are subject to other operating and production risks such as title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices  limitations in the market for products  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against certain of these risks either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we cannot predict if or when any such risks could affect our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not adequately insured could cause our actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
drilling risks 
our decision to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis  production data and engineering studies  which are inherently imprecise 
therefore  we cannot assure you that all of our drilling activities will be successful or that we will not drill uneconomical wells 
the occurrence of unexpected drilling results could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
uncertainties in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas we cannot measure in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of those accumulations of data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is from time to time exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility and the million principal of convertible subordinated notes due june  since interest charged borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 
changes in interest rates would  assuming all other things being equal  cause the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate  such as the notes  to increase or decrease  and thus increase or decrease the amount required to refinance the debt 
the fair value of the notes is dependent on prevailing interest rates and our current stock price as it relates to the conversion price of per share of our common stock 
hedging contracts meridian may address market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into swaps and other derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction
