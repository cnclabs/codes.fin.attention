item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s service area 
the possibility that the company is not able to increase its market share at the anticipated premium rates 
the possibility of increased litigation  legislation or regulation such as the numerous class action lawsuits that have been recently filed against managed care companies and the pending initiatives to increase health care regulation that might increase regulatory oversight which  in turn  would have the potential for increased costs 
the potential for increased medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
increased practitioner and pharmaceutical costs 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits or limit the company s oversight ability 
the possibility that the company is not able to negotiate new or renewal contracts with appropriate physicians  other health care practitioners  hospitals and facilities 
general during the three year period ended december   the company experienced modest membership expansion 
while membership in certain products continues to grow  other products have decreased when compared to the company has achieved its overall size by continually expanding its product lines which include point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products and group term life and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have remained at or near competitive levels for the company s marketplace 
during  the company s consolidated operating margin showed improvement over the company achieved s results  in part  by implementing product price increases and reducing or eliminating membership in products or effectively terminating groups that had the potential for continued unprofitability 
the company anticipates that it will continue to increase premium rates during this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of those risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially affected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of physicians and health care practitioners should result in continued profitability 
due to continued concern about privacy  the accountability of health insurers and hmos  and the cost and availability of health care coverage  legislation has been considered and is likely to be considered by the united states congress and the legislatures of the states in which the company operates or may seek to operate 
in  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  commonly called hipaa was enacted 
this bill established certain requirements for insurers  health maintenance organizations and erisa plans regarding eligibility rules for health care coverage 
the law also included administration simplification provisions to regulate and standardize information exchanges and establish standards for the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
the four key areas of administration simplification are transactions and code sets  unique identifiers  security  and privacy 
hhs has published final regulations on transactions and code sets and privacy and expects final regulations for unique identifiers and security in these rules will apply to insurers  health maintenance organizations  providers and erisa plans and will effect the business operations of these entities 
mlh  mamsi s hmos and homecall are in the process of assessing current procedures and developing plans to comply with the administration simplification provisions of hipaa 
the company believes it has sufficient internal resources to address those issues related to hipaa compliance 
if internal resources prove to be insufficient  the company will engage outside resources 
the statements in this paragraph regarding the future effects of hipaa are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information for a description of risk factors 
mamsi has two years plus two months from the effective date of the final regulations to comply 
state legislatures and the us congress continue to debate and consider legislation to amend civil tort law so as to expand enterprise liability to insurers  hmos and erisa plans as well as other health care reform initiatives 
neither congress nor any state legislature in the company s service area has enacted laws that would expand an insurer s or hmo s liability in tort action 
states in the company s service area have enacted laws regarding the internal and external review of adverse utilization review decisions 
under these laws  persons covered by insurers or hmos subject to state regulation are given a right to seek a fast and fair review of these decisions  first internally by a medical director and then externally by an independent review organization and or a state regulator 
maryland  the district of columbia  virginia  north carolina  west virginia and pennsylvania have enacted such laws 
state legislatures are considering a variety of proposals to increase access to health care coverage 
this includes expanding the eligibility rules for the medicaid program and tax credits for the purchase of group or individual insurance 
the us department of labor recently promulgated claims processing regulations which establish processing times for pre service and post service claims and time frames for claims appeals 
while the regulations are consistent with the company s current operations  mlh and mamsi s hmos may need to modify some procedures to comply with these regulations 
the state of maryland has proposed similar claims processing regulations that mlh and mamsi s hmos will comply with by march these regulations establish a new definition for clean claims  specify the attachments insurers and hmos may require with the original claim submission  and establish areas where an insurer or hmo may request additional information 
the company expects that continued legislative scrutiny of health insurers and hmos may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations the company s consolidated net income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased from 
in year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in earnings is attributable to an increase in premiums per member  a reduction in medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical care ratio  offset somewhat by an increase in administrative expense 
the company has priced its health products competitively in order to increase its membership base and thereby enhance its strategic position in its market place 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia and certain areas of west virginia  north carolina and pennsylvania 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
management believes that commercial health premiums should continue to increase over the next twelve months as the company continues to increase its commercial membership and as new and renewing groups are charged higher premium rates due to legislatively mandated benefit enhancements and general price increases initiated by the company 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information for a description of the risk factors that may affect health premiums per member 
the company has implemented increased premium rates across essentially all of its commercial products 
as the company s contracts are generally for a one year period  increased pricing cannot be initiated until a contract reaches its renewal date 
therefore  price increases cannot be made across the company s membership at the same time 
commercial premium rate increases are expected to continue in in the range of to 
management believes that these rate increases may have the effect of slowing the company s future membership growth 
in addition  management reevaluated premium reimbursement rates with regard to its medicare and medicaid programs 
specifically  effective january   the company withdrew from participation in the medicare program 
in october   the company withdrew from participation in the north carolina and west virginia medicaid programs 
effective may   the company transferred its membership in the virginia medicaid program to a non affiliated carrier 
therefore  as of may   the company ended its participation in any government entitlement health insurance programs 
the company s future membership growth depends on several factors such as relative premium prices and product availability  future increases or decreases in the company s service area and increased competition in the company s service area 
the company s home health operations contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase in services provided to non affiliated companies 
life and short term disability products contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the medical care ratio decreased to percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
the decrease in the medical care ratio is due to a combination of factors including continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  continued activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the company s withdrawal from state medicaid programs  and also increased premiums per member 
the ongoing initiatives should help to control the company s medical care ratio 
the medical expense trend is expected to be between and for the statements in this paragraph and the preceding paragraphs regarding future utilization rates  cost containment initiatives  total medical costs and trend and future increases in health premiums per member are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information above for a description of risk factors that may affect medical expenses per member and the medical care ratio 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue administrative expense ratio increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  management believes that the administrative expense ratio will increase modestly in management s expectation concerning the administrative expense ratio is a forward looking statement 
the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums and other revenues  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
investment income increased million primarily due to an increase in investment securities balances 
the effective tax rate decreased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in tax exempt income  the restructuring of certain operations to increase tax efficiency and the benefit from certain one time tax credits 
the net margin rate increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the factors described above 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations the company s consolidated net income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  earnings per share increased from 
in year ended december  to 
for the year ended december  the increase in earnings is attributable to an increase in premiums per member  a reduction in the medical care ratio  offset somewhat by an increase in administrative expense 
in addition  the results include a non recurring item related to the results of an audit conducted in connection with the company s participation in the fehbp as well as the effect of certain real estate sales and retirements of equipment 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  includes million in gains related to the sale of certain company owned real estate no longer required in its operations 
excluding these gains  year over year revenue increased percent 
a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
the increase in hmo and indemnity enrollment is principally due to increases in the company s commercial membership 
the company s home health operations contributed million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase in services provided to companies other than mamsi 
the medical care ratio decreased to percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
the decrease in the medical care ratio is due to a combination of factors including continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  expanded activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the company s withdrawal from the medicare program and certain state medicaid programs  and also increased premiums per member 
the administrative expense ratio increased from percent adjusted to exclude the effect of real estate gains in revenue for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  management believes that the administrative expense ratio will increase modestly in as additional personnel with specialized medical and other expertise who were only with the company for part of are reflected for a full year 
included in the company s year to date results is a  charge related to an audit conducted by the office of inspector general concerning the company s participation in the fehbp for the years the report s findings indicated that in the years the fehbp was charged rates that exceeded the then market price 
the report had no findings for the years also reflected in the company s results is a million write down of certain computer and computer related assets that the company had identified as being no longer of use and which were discarded or sold 
the net margin rate increased from 
percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to physicians and health care practitioners  which generally vary in direct proportion to the health premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in physician and health care practitioner billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source  coupled with the company s operating line of credit  will continue to be sufficient in the future 
the company s cash and investment securities increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the timing of medical expense payments which traditionally lag behind the receipt of increased premiums per member  the company s net income and cash received from exercise of stock options offset by the effect of treasury stock purchases 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to the timing of customer billings and payments offset by payment on receivables due from the fehbp 
prepaid expenses  advances and other decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to collection of income tax refunds from prior years offset by an increase in working capital advances paid to maryland hospitals 
net property and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to build out and renovation costs associated with the purchase of a building  for use in the company s operations  in late december medical claims payable increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to increased membership and an increase in medical expenses per member 
additional paid in capital increased from million at december  to million at december  due to an additional million shares of the company s stock being placed into the sct  as well as an increase in the market value of the shares of the company s stock held in the sct 
this also accounts for the change in the sct balance 
treasury stock increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the purchase of  additional shares by the company at a total cost of  the company currently has access to total revolving credit facilities of million  which is used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   approximately million was drawn against these facilities 
in addition  the company maintains a million letter of credit for the benefit of the north carolina insurance department in support of the operations of mlh  and a  letter of credit for the company s home health subsidiary 
while no amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit  they reduce the company s credit line availability 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents   investment securities   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   the company believes that cash generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned operations 
the company s major business operations are principally conducted through its hmos and insurance company 
hmos and insurance companies are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity  and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent corporations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   those subsidiaries of the company were in compliance with all minimum capital requirements
