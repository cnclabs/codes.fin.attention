the company has also entered into a number of option agreements for the development of future regional malls and community centers 
except for these projects and as further described below  the company currently has no other capital commitments 
it is management s expectation that the company will continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and grow its business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken by the company as suitable opportunities arise 
such activities are not expected to be undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved

other capital expenditures management prepares an annual capital expenditures budget for each property which is intended to provide for all necessary recurring capital improvements and maintenance items

these capital expenditures generate a return through increased rents from these tenants over the term of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  or remodeling and renovation costs  were million  the majority of which was for the renovation of asheville mall in asheville  north carolina  and three community centers 
revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as parking lot and roof repairs that are recovered from the tenants  were million in environmental matter the company believes that the properties  with the exception of parkway place in huntsville  alabama  are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling  discharge  and emission of hazardous or toxic substances 
at parkway place asbestos abatement will occur in portions of the existing mall during demolition which will be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company has not been notified by any governmental authority and is not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance  liability  or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in cash provided from the operations of ten new centers opened or acquired in the last months offset by decreases in cash flow from the sales of properties 
cash flows used in investing activities for decreased by million  or  to million compared with million in this decrease was primarily due to the smaller number of acquisitions in compared with the number of acquisitions in cash flows provided by financing activities for decreased by million  or  to million from million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased borrowings related to the acquisition program and the retirement of debt with proceeds from sales of the properties 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents from the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
cbl associats properties  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has determined that a portion of its derivative instruments swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement in place are ineffective as defined by sfas no 
the terms of ineffective derivative instruments expire in  thus while the company may experience some volatility in earnings in interim periods  there will be no effect to current earnings in the company s financial statements for the year ended december  if the company had implemented sfas no 
as of december   ineffective derivative instruments would have increased total assets by  and would have increased net income by  effective derivative instruments would have increased liabilities by  and comprehensive income  also recorded on the balance sheet  would have decreased by  funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
ffo is defined by the company as net income loss before depreciation of real estate assets  gains or losses on sales of real estate and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
ffo also includes the company s share of ffo in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of ffo in consolidated properties other than the operating partnership 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit recommendation concerning finance costs and non real estate depreciation 
the company excludes gains or losses on outparcel sales  even though nareit permits their inclusion when calculating ffo 
gains or losses on outparcel sales would have added to ffo million in compared with million in the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the operating partnership and the company 
accordingly  management expects that ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners including the company 
management also believes that ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits and provides a relevant basis for comparison among companies 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  is not necessarily indicative of cash from operations available to fund all cash flow needs  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
effective january   nareit clarified ffo to include all operating results recurring and non recurring except those results defined as extraordinary items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company implemented this clarification in the first quarter of and no longer adds back to ffo development costs charged to net income 
this amount was  for the year ended december  for comparatice purposes  the company has recomputed its ffo herein to exclude the add back of development costs charged to net income of  in  ffo increased by million  or  to million compared with million in the increase in ffo was primarily attributable to the continuing increase in revenues and income from operations from ten new developments and acquisitions  and increases in occupancy levels and higher rents in the company s stabilized portfolio offset by ffo decreases from the sales of thirteen properties 
cbl associats properties  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  income from operations     add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties     income from operations of unconsolidated affiliates 
   depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated affiliates   subtract minority investors share of income from operations   minority investors share of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets and finance costs   preferred dividends     total funds from operations     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has managed the market risk for its variable rate debt with derivative financial instruments 
the derivative instruments are described in the liquidity and capital resources section in item above and in note to the financial statements 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
