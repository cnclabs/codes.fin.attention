in reviewing these facts as well as the potential impact of general economic conditions  the company has increased its allowance for loss levels accordingly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of its business  the company is subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company is exposed to such interest rate risk from the time elapsed between the approval of a transaction with a customer and when permanent fixed rate financing is secured 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company temporarily funds its new fixed rate financing contracts through variable rate revolving credit borrowings until permanent fixed rate financing is obtained through its securitization facilities 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes between the time a new financing contract is approved and the time the permanent  fixed rate financing is completed  thereby locking in financing spreads 
the company mitigates this exposure by obtaining such permanent financing generally within days of the activation date of the new financing contract and believes it will be able to continue this operating strategy 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts as a hedge against variable interest rates incurred through its commercial paper securitization facilities as well as on its class a and class b notes in its term securitization transaction 
these swap agreements have the effect of converting the company s debt from securitizations from a variable rate to a fixed rate 
changes in interest rates would result in unrealized gains or losses in the market value of the fixed rate debt to the extent of differences between current market rates and the actual stated rates for these debt instruments 
at december   the mark to market value of all interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately  against the company 
assuming a hypothetical reduction in interest rates from current weighted average swap rates  the mark to market value of the swap agreements against the company would have changed by approximately  at december  the carrying value of the company s fixed rate debt at december  was  assuming this debt was to be discounted using the fixed rate received by the company on its most recent securitization transaction in december  the estimated fair value of this debt would have been approximately  the company s variable rate debt at december  was  which approximated fair value 
sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the impacts that market risk exposures may have on fair values of the company s debt instruments 
assuming a hypothetical change in interest rates from current weighted average debt rates  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would have changed by approximately  at december  the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt would have changed the company s consolidated interest expense by approximately  for the year ended december  the company s portfolio of financing contracts originated in its licensed professional financing segment are fixed rate  non cancelable  full payout leases and notes receivable due in installments 
at december   the carrying value of these assets  including the retained interest of sold assets  was approximately  assuming the anticipated future cash flows associated with these assets were discounted at current rates applied to similar contracts  the estimated fair value of these assets would have approximated  at december  assuming implicit rates changed by a hypothetical from current weighted average implicit rates  the fair value of the company s fixed rate financing contracts would have changed by approximately  at december  the company s variable rate assets generally comprise financing contracts originated by its commercial asset based lending subsidiary  acfc 
these financing agreements are structured as variable rate lines of credit extended to various commercial and industrial entities  collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory  or fixed assets  generally for periods of two to three years 
at december   the carrying value of these assets was approximately  which approximated fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate financing contracts would have changed the company s consolidated interest income by approximately  for the year ended december  for additional information about the company s financial instruments  see note k in notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act 
discussions containing such forward looking statements may be found in the material set forth under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business sections of this form k  as well as within the annual report generally 
when used in this annual report  the words believes  anticipates  expects  plans  intends  estimates  continue  could  may or will or the negative of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk considerations set forth below under the heading certain considerations and the matters set forth in this annual report generally 
hpsc cautions the reader  however  that such list of considerations may not be exhaustive 
hpsc undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
certain considerations dependence on funding sources  restrictive covenants 
the company s financing activities are capital intensive 
the company s revenues and profitability are related directly to the volume of financing contracts it originates 
to generate new financing contracts  the company requires access to substantial short and long term credit 
to date  the company s principal sources of funding for its financing transactions have been i a revolving credit facility with fleet bank  as agent  for borrowing up to million the revolver  ii million in limited recourse revolving credit facilities with bravo and capital  iii a term asset securitization of million completed in december  iv fixed rate  full recourse term loans from several savings banks  v specific recourse sales of financing contracts to savings banks and other purchasers  vi the issuance of subordinated debt in and vii the company s internally generated revenues 
the company s revolver provides availability through may at which time the company plans to renew the facility for another year 
however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to renew or extend the revolver or to complete additional asset securitizations or to obtain other additional financing when needed and on acceptable terms 
the company would be adversely affected if it were unable to continue to secure sufficient and timely funding on acceptable terms 
the agreement governing the revolver the revolver agreement contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with these covenants  and failure to meet such covenants or a failure to amend or waive compliance would result in a default under the revolver agreement 
moreover  the company s financing arrangements with bravo and capital and the savings banks described above incorporate the covenants and default provisions of the revolver agreement 
the term asset securitization facility also contains covenants and default provisions as does the indenture governing the company s senior subordinated notes issued in thus  any material default that is not amended or waived under any of these agreements will likely result in a default under most or all of the company s financing arrangements 
in addition  the senior subordinated note indenture contains certain limits on the company s ability to incur senior debt 
securitization recourse  payment restriction and default risk 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company utilizes asset securitization transactions with wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries to seek fixed rate  matched term financing 
the company transfers financing contracts to these subsidiaries which  in turn  either pledge or sell the contracts to third parties 
the third parties recourse with regard to the pledge or sale is limited to the contracts sold to the subsidiary 
if the contract portfolio of these subsidiaries does not perform within certain guidelines  the subsidiaries must retain or trap any monthly cash distribution to which the company might otherwise be entitled 
this restriction on cash distributions could continue until the portfolio performance returns to acceptable levels as defined in the relevant agreements  which restriction could have a negative impact on the cash flow available to the company 
in the event of a payment trap  there can be no assurance that the portfolio performance would return to acceptable levels or that the payment restrictions would be removed 
customer credit risks 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in connection with payments due under financing contracts originated by the company whether or not such contracts have been securitized  held as collateral for loans to the company or sold at a level which the company deems sufficient to meet future estimated uncollectible receivables  based on an analysis of the delinquencies  problem accounts  and overall risks and probable losses associated with such contracts  together with a review of the company s historical credit loss experience 
there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate 
failure of the company s customers to make scheduled payments under their financing contracts could require the company to i make payments in connection with its recourse loan and asset sale transactions  ii lose its residual interest in any underlying equipment or iii lose collateral pledged as security for the company s limited recourse asset securitizations 
in addition  although the charge offs on the portfolio of the company were less than of the company s average net investment in leases and notes owned and managed for  any increase in such losses or in the rate of payment defaults under the financing contracts originated by the company could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing  including its ability to complete additional asset securitizations and secured asset sales or loans 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or reduce its current level of credit losses 
competition 
the company operates in highly competitive markets 
the company competes for customers with a number of national  regional and local finance companies  including those which  like the company  specialize in financing for healthcare providers 
in addition  the company s competitors include those equipment manufacturers which finance the sale or lease of their products themselves  other leasing companies and other types of financial services companies such as commercial banks and savings and loan associations 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing and operational resources than the company 
moreover  the company s future profitability will be directly related to its ability to obtain capital funding at favorable funding rates as compared to the capital costs of its competitors 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include many larger  more established companies that have a lower cost of funds than the company and access to capital markets and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in its targeted markets 
equipment market risk 
the demand for the company s equipment financing depends upon various factors not within its control 
these factors include general economic conditions  including the effects of recession or inflation  and fluctuations in supply and demand related to  among other things  i technological advances in and economic obsolescence of equipment and ii government regulation of equipment and payment for healthcare services 
changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare and medicaid programs and other third party payors  such as insurance companies  as well as changes in the reimbursement policies of managed care organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  may also affect demand for medical and dental equipment and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in healthcare payment policies 
the increasing cost of medical care has brought about federal and state regulatory changes designed to limit governmental reimbursement of certain healthcare providers 
these changes include the enactment of fixed price reimbursement systems in which the rates of payment to hospitals  outpatient clinics and private individual and group practices for specific categories of care are determined in advance of treatment 
rising healthcare costs may also cause non governmental medical insurers  such as blue cross and blue shield associations and the growing number of self insured employers  to revise their reimbursement systems and policies governing the purchasing and leasing of medical and dental equipment 
alternative healthcare delivery systems  such as health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed care programs  have adopted similar cost containment measures 
other proposals to reform the united states healthcare system are considered from time to time 
these proposals could lead to increased government involvement in healthcare and otherwise change the operating environment for the company s customers 
healthcare providers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring investment in medical and dental equipment 
future changes in the healthcare industry  including governmental regulation thereof  and the effect of such changes on the company s business cannot be predicted 
changes in payment or reimbursement programs could adversely affect the ability of the company s customers to satisfy their payment obligations to the company and  accordingly  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
interest rate risk 
except for approximately million of the company s financing contracts  which are at variable interest rates with no scheduled payments  the company s financing contracts require the company s customers to make payments at fixed interest rates for specified terms 
however  approximately million of the company s borrowings currently are subject to a variable interest rate 
consequently  an increase in interest rates  before the company is able to secure fixed rate  long term financing for such contracts or to generate higher rate financing contracts to compensate for the increased borrowing cost  could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to secure additional long term financing at favorable rates and to generate higher rate financing contracts is limited by many factors  including competition  market and general economic conditions and the company s financial condition 
residual value risk 
at the inception of its equipment leasing transactions  the company estimates what it believes will be the fair market value of the financed equipment at the end of the initial lease term and records that value typically of the initial purchase price on its balance sheet 
the company s results of operations depend  to some degree  upon its ability to realize these residual values as of december   the estimated residual value of equipment at the end of the lease term was approximately million  representing approximately of the company s total assets 
realization of residual values depends on many factors  several of which are not within the company s control  including  but not limited to  general market conditions at the time of the lease expiration  any unusual wear and tear on the equipment  the cost of comparable new equipment  the extent  if any  to which the equipment has become technologically or economically obsolete during the contract term  and the effects of any new government regulations 
if  upon the expiration of a lease contract  the company sells or refinances the underlying equipment and the amount realized is less than the original recorded residual value for such equipment  a loss reflecting the difference will be recorded on the company s books 
failure to realize aggregate recorded residual values could have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of receivables 
as part of the company s portfolio management strategy and as a source of funding of its operations  the company has sold selected pools of its lease contracts and notes receivable due in installments to a number of savings banks and as part of the bravo  capital and term asset securitization facilities 
each of these sale transactions is subject to certain covenants that may require the company to i repurchase financing contracts and or make payments under certain circumstances  including the delinquency of the underlying debtor  and ii service the underlying financing contracts 
the company carries a reserve for each transaction in its allowance for losses and recognizes a gain that is included for accounting purposes in net revenues for the year in which the sale transaction is completed 
each of these securitization transactions has financial and operating covenants which are the same as or similar to those contained in the revolver agreement 
thus  a material default under any agreement is likely to be a default under most or all of the company s other financing agreements 
the company may enter into additional agreements for the sale of its financing contracts in the future in order to manage its liquidity 
the level of reserves established by the company in relation to its sold financing contracts may prove to be inadequate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to sell its leases and notes or that the sales in the future will generate gain recognition that is comparable to that recognized in the past 
dependence on sales representatives 
the company is  and its growth and future revenues are  dependent in a large part upon i the ability of the company s sales representatives to establish new relationships  and maintain existing relationships  with equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers and with healthcare providers and other customers and ii the extent to which such relationships lead equipment vendors  distributors and manufacturers to promote the company s financing services to potential purchasers of their equipment 
as of december   the company had field sales representatives and in house sales personnel 
although the company is not materially dependent upon any one sales representative  the loss of a group of sales representatives could  until appropriate replacements were obtained  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on current management 
the operations and future success of the company are dependent upon the continued efforts of the company s executive officers  two of whom are also directors of the company 
the loss of the services of any of these key executives could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has historically experienced fluctuating quarterly revenues and earnings due to varying portfolio performance and operating and interest costs 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that quarterly comparisons of the results of its operations during any fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that results for any one fiscal quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance
