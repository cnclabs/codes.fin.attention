operating income  which excludes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in operating income in reflects a first quarter restructuring charge of million after taxes related to the implementation of a cost control initiative 
net income  which includes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in acquisition of executive risk inc 
in july  the chubb corporation corporation completed its acquisition of executive risk inc  a specialty insurance company offering directors and officers  errors and omissions and professional liability coverages 
executive risk shareholders received shares of the corporation s common stock for each outstanding common share of executive risk 
in addition  outstanding executive risk stock options were assumed and adjusted as options to purchase common stock of the corporation 
approximately million shares of common stock of the corporation were issued to executive risk shareholders and an additional million shares of common stock of the corporation were reserved for issuance upon exercise of the assumed executive risk stock options 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of executive risk are included in the corporation s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the assets and liabilities of executive risk were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the value of the stock options assumed by the corporation was included in the purchase price 
the total purchase price was approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired  amounting to approximately million  has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over years 
property and casualty insurance property and casualty income before taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the higher earnings in were due primarily to an improvement in underwriting results  caused in large part by substantially lower catastrophe losses compared with the prior year 
the decrease in earnings in was due to deterioration in underwriting results caused in large part by the effect of inadequate prices resulting from the prolonged soft market on our standard commercial results  which include multiple peril  casualty and workers compensation  and  to a lesser extent  higher catastrophe losses compared with investment income increased in both and compared with the respective prior years 
catastrophe losses were million in  million in and million in the amount was net of reinsurance recoveries of approximately million related to hurricane georges 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during or since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million in the united states and generally million outside the united states 
reported net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of compared with reported net premiums written increased in compared with premium growth in and was affected by the inclusion of executive risk written premiums since the date of acquisition 
excluding the effect of the acquisition of executive risk  premium growth was in and in personal coverages accounted for billion or of net premiums written  standard commercial coverages for billion or and specialty commercial coverages for billion or 
premium growth in personal lines was strong in both and in commercial lines  competition in the worldwide marketplace has made profitable premium growth difficult 
however  our strategy  begun in late  to increase the pricing in the standard commercial classes and to not renew underperforming accounts where we could not attain price adequacy has shown increasing success throughout and further  many of our competitors have also insisted on higher prices since the latter part of as a result  the pricing outlook in the standard commercial classes continues to be favorable 
substantial premium growth was achieved in and outside the united states  particularly in europe  our largest foreign market 
non us premiums grew and in and  respectively  in original currency 
however  due to the strength of the us dollar  particularly in  reported us premiums increased by only in and in underwriting results were near breakeven in compared with unprofitable results in and near breakeven results in the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in the loss ratio was in compared with in and in losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in catastrophe losses affecting results in and resulted primarily from weather related events in the united states  including in particular hurricane floyd in the third quarter of the catastrophe losses resulted primarily from the winter ice storms in canada in the first quarter  the wind and hail storms in the united states in the second quarter and hurricane georges in puerto rico in the third quarter 
our expense ratio was in compared with in and in the increase in the expense ratio in was due to overhead expenses growing at a somewhat higher rate than written premiums 
the lower expense ratio in compared with the prior year was due to salary and overhead expenses decreasing due to a cost control initiative discussed below and a change in accounting that has resulted in the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use that were previously expensed 
during  we implemented an activity value analysis process that identified and eliminated low value activities and improved operational efficiency while redirecting resources to activities having the greatest potential to contribute to the corporation s results 
the cost control initiative resulted in job reductions through a combination of early retirements  terminations and attrition 
other savings resulted from improved vendor management and lower consulting expenses and other operating costs 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the implementation of the initiative 
the majority of the charge consisted of accruals for providing enhanced pension benefits and postretirement medical benefits to employees who accepted an early retirement incentive offer 
the liabilities related to these enhanced benefits have been included in the pension and postretirement medical benefits liabilities and are being reduced as benefit payments are made over time 
all of the other restructuring costs have been paid 
the initiative was completed with no significant differences from the original estimates of the restructuring costs 
personal insurance our personal insurance business continued to produce exceptionally strong results in  measured by both growth and profitability 
net premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with a increase in we continued to grow our personal lines business with the in force policy count for all coverages increasing significantly 
for most coverages  such growth exceeded each year 
growth has been achieved while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection 
personal lines premiums outside the united states grew significantly in and  although from a small base 
much of this growth was in europe where rates are inadequate 
remedial actions are under way to improve the profitability of this business 
our personal insurance business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in homeowners results were near breakeven in compared with profitable results in as a decrease in catastrophe losses was more than offset by an unusually high number of large non catastrophe losses in  particularly in the first half of the year 
homeowners results in were less profitable than in due to an increase in both catastrophe losses and non catastrophe losses 
results in were also adversely affected by two large losses aggregating million  net of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in homeowners results were unprofitable in europe in each of the past three years as rates are inadequate and we are still building the critical mass necessary to absorb the costs of operating that franchise 
our personal automobile business produced substantial profits in each of the last three years 
however  results in were less profitable due to an increase in the frequency of losses in the liability component of this business 
results in each year benefited from stable loss severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  were highly profitable in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
standard commercial insurance net premiums from standard commercial insurance decreased in compared with an decrease in the decrease in premiums in both years was the result of the strategy we put in place in late to renew good business at adequate prices and not renew underperforming business where we cannot attain price adequacy 
as a result  retention levels declined during and on the business that has renewed  however  rates have increased steadily and such increases accelerated in the market remains firm and shows no signs of weakening 
our standard commercial insurance business produced substantial underwriting losses in each of the past three years  but showed improvement in the improvement was due primarily to fewer large losses as well as the progress made on our initiative to increase prices while not renewing unprofitable accounts 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in rates are still inadequate 
underpriced business will continue to put pressure on standard commercial underwriting results in we will continue to push for higher rates in multiple peril results were unprofitable in each of the past three years due  in large part  to inadequate prices 
however  such results showed significant improvement in the improvement occurred in both the property and liability components of this business due to a lower frequency of large losses in both the united states and overseas 
results in the property component also benefited from an absence of catastrophe losses 
results had deteriorated in compared with the prior year due to an increase in the severity of liability losses as well as several large property losses overseas 
there were virtually no catastrophe losses for this class in catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio in and percentage points in results for our casualty business were unprofitable in each of the past three years 
results in were similar to those in  as improvement in the primary liability component was offset by further deterioration in the automobile component 
in  casualty results had deteriorated  primarily in these two components 
casualty results in each of the past three years were adversely affected by incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the excess liability component of our casualty coverages was modestly unprofitable in and compared with the near breakeven results in due to increases in the severity of the large losses that are prevalent in this class as well as declining prices over the past several years 
excess liability results in each of the past three years benefited from favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
results for the primary liability component were unprofitable in each of the past three years  but more so in due to a higher frequency of large losses 
primary and excess liability results outside the united states deteriorated in results in the automobile component were increasingly unprofitable over the past three years due in large part to inadequate prices  a consequence of the prolonged soft market  and an increased frequency of losses 
results in were also adversely affected by uninsured motorist claims in ohio  the result of a state supreme court decision that the uninsured and underinsured motorists coverages of commercial automobile insurance policies also cover employees and their family members even when they are driving their personal cars for non business purposes 
workers compensation results were near breakeven in compared with results that were similarly unprofitable in and the improvement in was due to higher rates as well as a lower frequency of losses  resulting in part from our disciplined risk selection during the past two years 
specialty commercial insurance reported net premiums from specialty commercial insurance increased by in compared with a increase in excluding the effect of the acquisition of executive risk  premium growth was about in and in our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to bring new products to market and differentiate such products continue to enable us to renew a large percentage of our executive protection and financial institutions business 
excluding the effect of the executive risk acquisition  executive protection and financial institutions premiums increased in by and  respectively  substantial improvements over the growth 
however  a competitive market continues to put prices under pressure  particularly for our executive protection business 
growth in our financial institutions business was particularly strong in due to new business as well as rate increases on the standard commercial component of this business 
growth in property and marine premiums in and was restricted by the effect on retention levels of pricing initiatives and non renewing certain unprofitable accounts 
growth in our other specialty commercial business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance business that began operations in our specialty commercial underwriting results were highly profitable in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in property and marine results remained highly unprofitable over the past three years 
the positive effect of the pricing initiative and the culling of unprofitable accounts was offset in by higher catastrophe losses and in by significantly higher losses overseas 
results in all three years were adversely affected by a high frequency of large property losses 
catastrophe losses for this class represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in executive protection results were profitable in each of the past three years on business worldwide due to favorable development of prior year loss reserves  particularly in the directors and officers and fiduciary liability components 
however  we have been seeing a narrowing of profit margins over the three most recent accident years from the levels we experienced before that 
as a result  we have begun a rate initiative and we are analyzing our book of business 
we are focusing in particular on our employment practices liability business  which has been unprofitable 
our financial institutions business was also profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience in the fidelity component of this business 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced breakeven results in compared with unprofitable results in and profitable results in our other commercial classes produced unprofitable results in compared with profitable results in and near breakeven results in our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years 
however  such results were less profitable in due primarily to one million loss  net of reinsurance 
aviation results were highly unprofitable in each of the past three years 
loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
at the end of  gross loss reserves totaled billion compared with billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was billion at year end compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
the and gross loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable include amounts related to executive risk 
executive risk has historically utilized reinsurance to a greater extent because its size limited the amount of risk it could retain 
loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in compared with million or in the increase in included million of net reserves assumed upon the acquisition of executive risk 
the increase would have been million greater except that loss reserves were reduced by payments in that amount during the year related to the settlement of asbestos related claims against fibreboard corporation 
excluding the executive risk reserves assumed and the fibreboard payments  loss reserves increased in reserve growth each year has occurred primarily in those liability classes that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such redundancies were reflected in operating results in these respective years 
each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim experience for certain liability classes  offset in part by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the process of establishing loss reserves is a complex and imprecise science that reflects significant judgmental factors 
this is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions  changing legislative  judicial and social environments and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss 
in fact  more than of our net loss reserves at december  were for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience continue to further complicate the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions and judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
in the past year  the continued flow of claims pushed about a half dozen manufacturers and users of asbestos products into bankruptcy 
to date  approximately major companies have filed for bankruptcy as a result of asbestos liability 
in part as a result of these bankruptcies  the volume and value of claims against viable asbestos defendants continue to increase 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve traditional defendants who manufactured  distributed or installed asbestos products for whom we wrote excess liability coverages 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
in addition  the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
class actions are then initiated even though many of the claimants have not manifested evidence of serious injury 
thus  new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that practically all manufacturing and usage of asbestos ended nearly two decades ago 
based on published projections  we expect that we will continue receiving asbestos claims at the current rate for at least the next several years 
the expanded focus of asbestos litigation beyond asbestos manufacturers and distributors to installers and premises owners has created in some instances conflicts among insureds  primary insurers and excess insurers  primarily involving questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits 
these issues are generating costly coverage litigation with the potential for inconsistent results 
a legislative solution to the asbestos claim litigation is being pursued by some insurers  including chubb  and major corporate defendants 
any such solution would require the support of members of the plaintiffs bar 
the new administration coupled with the rash of recent bankruptcies may create the best opportunity for such a legislative solution 
significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos related claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims as well as the increase in the volume of claims by plaintiffs claiming exposure but with no symptoms of asbestos related disease 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present land owners or past or present site operators 
the prps  with proper government authorization in many instances  disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up have become substantial  prps and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  it has not been re enacted 
notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution that would reform the liability provisions of the law  federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
it is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to various factors  including more efficient site remediation efforts 
however  litigation remains a serious problem 
litigation costs remain substantial  particularly for hazardous waste claims 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs 
this unlimited defense provided in the policies sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs substantially exceeding the indemnity exposure 
a substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
these reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were million in  million in and million in further increases in loss reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims continue to be clarified 
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  as well as some continuing uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean up  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge which would adversely affect results in future periods 
the amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time 
catastrophe exposure the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries have an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control catastrophe exposures 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
investments and liquidity investment income after taxes increased in compared with and in compared with the growth was due in part to an increase in invested assets  which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period 
growth in both years was also due in part to the inclusion of executive risk investment income since the date of acquisition 
excluding the effect of the acquisition of executive risk  growth was about in and in the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuates each year as a result of changes in the percentage of our portfolio invested in tax exempt bonds 
generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with million in and million in new cash available in was lower than in and due primarily to higher paid losses in caused in large part by significantly higher payments on directors and officers liability and excess liability claims compared with previous years 
new cash available in was not affected by the fibreboard related payments during the year since such payments were made from an escrow account that was funded in in  we invested new cash primarily in mortgage backed securities 
in  new cash was invested in tax exempt bonds and corporate bonds 
also  during  we reduced our equity securities portfolio by approximately million with million of the proceeds used to fund the purchase of a interest in hiscox plc  a uk personal and commercial specialty insurer 
in  new cash was invested primarily in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid  short term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs  and the corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocable to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in both and compared with income of million in the losses in and were primarily due to increasingly higher interest expense each year  due to the inclusion of interest expense on the debt assumed in connection with the executive risk acquisition in july in  corporate and other included income of million from a noncompete payment related to the sale of the corporation s interest in associated aviation underwriters  inc aau 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in each of the past three years  which amounts are included in the corporate and other results for those years 
in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in we own approximately million of land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we own approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
loans receivable  which amounted to million at december   are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized 
investment gains and losses net investment gains realized by the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries were as follows in millions equity securities fixed maturities sale of aau realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year 
sales of equity securities in and resulted in net realized investment gains due primarily to the significant appreciation in the united states equity markets 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
fixed maturity securities that the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments carried at market value  which includes equity securities and fixed maturities classified as available for sale  is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due to fluctuations in interest rates 
market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which exposes the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the table below provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of taxable bonds are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  approximately are rated aa or better with more than rated aaa 
only of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
taxable bonds have an average maturity of six years while tax exempt bonds mature on average in eight years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected aaa rated commercial securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of billion supporting their international operations 
such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the table on page provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies

in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market prices of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio
