item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by its banks 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions of marietta savings  first federal  first savings  gf bancorp and westwood homestead and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the banks could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offered 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth by integrating its residential lending function through establishing mortgage banking operations in the banks primary market areas and  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the banks are operationally decentralized  with a management team focusing on consumer preferences for financial products in the respective communities served 
based on consumer preferences  camco s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent banks from its competition 
management believes that the banks abilities to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s net earnings have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including gains on sale of loans  loan servicing fees and other fees 
camco s operations are also influenced by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
asset and liability management net interest income  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  is the principal component of camco s net earnings 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rate levels 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which a financial institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect 
in recognition of the foregoing factors  the board of directors of each of the banks has implemented an asset and liability management strategy directed toward improving each bank s interest rate sensitivity 
the principal common elements of such strategies include meeting the consumer preference for fixed rate loans over the past several years by selling such loans in the secondary market  originating adjustable rate mortgage loans arms as demand increases coincident with an overall rise in interest rates in the economy  maintaining higher levels of liquid assets  such as cash  short term interest earning deposits and short term investment securities as a hedge against rising interest rates in a lower interest rate environment  and utilizing fhlb advances and longer term certificates of deposit as funding sources when available

loan origination volume  including the purchases of loans  during was less than the record volume by million  or  while the volume of loan sales increased by million year to year 
the decrease in loan volume was primarily attributable to a decrease in refinancing activity due to the increase in interest rates during the year

the allowance for loan losses was increased as a result of the acquisition by  which represented the allowance maintained by westwood homestead prior to the acquisition 
nonperforming loans days or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting 
and 
of total net loans  including loans held for sale at those dates 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over december  levels 
the increase resulted primarily from deposits of million acquired in the acquisition coupled with deposit portfolio growth of million  or  which resulted primarily from management s continuing efforts to increase deposits through marketing and pricing strategies

at december   each of the banks regulatory capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
increases in the level of income and expenses during the year ended december   compared to  are significantly influenced by the inclusion of the accounts of westwood homestead  which was acquired by camco in january in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the banks  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the banks market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the banks loan portfolios 
the provision for losses on loans totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the provision recorded in the provision generally reflects the effects of loan portfolio growth  coupled with an increase of  in the level of nonperforming loans year to year 
in the period subsequent to december   approximately  of the nonperforming loans have been paid off or paid to current status 
management believes all nonperforming loans are adequately collateralized and anticipates no loss on these loans

sfas no 
also specifies new methods of accounting for hedging transactions  prescribes the items and transactions that may be hedged  and specifies detailed criteria to be met to qualify for hedge accounting 
the definition of a derivative financial instrument is complex  but in general  it is an instrument with one or more underlyings  such as an interest rate or foreign exchange rate  that is applied to a notional amount  such as an amount of currency  to determine the settlement amount s 
it generally requires no significant initial investment and can be settled net or by delivery of an asset that is readily convertible to cash

applies to derivatives embedded in other contracts  unless the underlying of the embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the host contract 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  on adoption  entities are permitted to transfer held to maturity debt securities to the available for sale or trading category without calling into question their intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future
