item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general through its subsidiaries  zevex is in the business of designing  manufacturing and distributing medical devices 
the company s product lines include proprietary medical devices which it designs  manufactures  and distributes  and contract manufactured products which it designs and manufactures for original equipment manufacturers oem s 
zevex current strategy is to continue to aggressively grow proprietary product revenues with the acquisition and internal development of products that complement its existing two lines of proprietary products 
in addition  zevex will continue to manufacture products for others in order to capitalize on the outsourcing trend in the medical device industry 
recent developments the company substantially grew revenues during  diversifying its offering of proprietary products further and gaining market share in the markets served by them  as well as focusing its contract manufacturing business on higher margin core technologies that contain its ultrasonic and optoelectronic components  and fluid delivery systems 
recent key developments were in july  zevex inc entered into an agreement with nutrition medical  inc  a minnesota corporation  to acquire nutrition medical s product line of stationary feeding pumps  disposable sets and feeding tubes for enteral nutrition delivery 
company management believes that the addition of the nutrition medical stationary pump and feeding tube product lines complements the line of ambulatory enteral feeding pumps and disposable sets that the company has developed internally 
the company completed the acquisition of the nutrition medical product line on december   providing for a full year of revenue generation in on december   the company acquired jtech through a stock purchase transaction with the four shareholders of jtech 
jtech was organized in as a sole proprietorship and later incorporated as jtech medical industries  inc in to manufacture and sell range of motion measurement devices 
as mentioned above  jtech currently manufactures and markets its own proprietary musculoskeletal evaluation products for health care providers  a line of products not previously manufactured or sold by the companyzevex 
jtech s revenues combined with revenues from the company s proprietary enteral nutrition delivery products  accounted for more than of total zevex revenues in on december   the company acquired aborn through a stock purchase transaction with the sole shareholder of aborn 
aborn contributed to the company s zevex revenues and earnings throughout the entire year 
as described above  aborn currently designs and manufactures a variety of sophisticated optical sensors  custom computer chips  and semiconductor components for medical technology and other companies  and has brought new design and manufacturing expertise to the company 
in april  zevex inc acquired a portion of the enteral nutrition delivery device business of nestle usa  inc in an asset purchase 
the assets acquired included over  enteral feeding pumps owned by nestle and placed with various health care facilities under arrangements whereby the facilities agree to purchase disposable sets for use with nestle pumps 
the assets also included nestle s line of pump administration sets  feeding tubes  irrigation kits  ancillary devices for the pumps  and certain associated intellectual property with the completion of the acquisition  the company no longer will sell stationary feeding pumps to nestle 
instead  the company believes it will generate more revenue from the sale of disposable sets to users of the approximately  feeding pumps acquired from nestle than that which the company expected to generate from possible pump sales to nestle 
in addition to the installed based of stationary pumps acquired from nestle  the company plans to place more stationary feeding pumps with new users at little or no cost to the user under arrangements where the pump users commit to buy disposable products from the company while using the pumps 
on september   the company created an independent division  zevex oem  to hold and manage the company s contract manufacturing business 
the creation of the oem division was part of a strategic initiative that will allow the company to operate zevex inc s contract manufacturing business separately from its proprietary product businesses 
results of operations the company s sales results for were the strongest in the company s history 
revenues were  a increase over revenues of  in  which in turn represented a increase over revenues of  in revenues for increased primarily due to the contribution of the acquisition of the nestle product line

year ended december income statement data percentage of gross sales revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income other income expense income before taxes provisions for taxes net income the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  as compared to in and in management attributes the decrease in gross profit percentage from to to a number of matters  including the purchase of the lower margin nestle enteral delivery business mentioned above  startup costs related to bringing in house the manufacturing of the enteralez r enteral feeding pump  and the servicing of the nestle pumps acquired  which included labor  tooling  setup costs  and non recurring engineering nre  the growth of lower margin complete system manufacturing in zevex oem  and the approximately million write down in inventory from acquisitions  past oem contracts and discontinued proprietary products as described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during to  of gross sales  as compared to  of gross sales in  and  of gross sales in the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  as expressed as a percentage of sales is attributable to sales revenue growth far exceeding growth of selling  general and administrative expenses over the prior years

operating income decreased to  of gross revenue in compared to  of gross revenue in  compared to  of gross revenue in similarly  the company had a net income of  of gross revenue in  compared to  of gross revenue in  and  of gross revenue in the changes during as compared to and are principally due to the costs addressed above and the growth of lower margin products delivered during the year 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by acceptance of the markets for the company s proprietary and contract manufactured products  including the volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customers products or services as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customers attempt to balance its inventory  iii the customers need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customers preferences or strategies
