item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse effects of differing tax structures 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in one entity are charged to other entities in different foreign jurisdictions 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of all foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the company is also subject to market risk related to the interest rates on its existing line of credit 
as of march   such interest rates are based on the prime rate plus three quarters point 
as of december   million of the company s debt was subject to variable interest rates 
a basis point change in such rates during the year ended december  would have increased the company s interest expense by approximately
