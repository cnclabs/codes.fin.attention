item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company currently uses only foreign currency hedge derivative instruments  which  at a given date  are not material 
however  the company is exposed to interest rate risks 
the company generally invests in high grade commercial paper with original maturity dates of twelve months or less and conservative money market funds to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk on its marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  and december  the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material 
the table below provides information about the company s marketable securities  including principal cash flows for and the related weighted average interest rates in thousands estimated fair estimated fair principal value at principal value at cash flows december  cash flows december  for for corporate bonds   medium and short term notes   euro dollar bonds     zero coupon notes total portfolio value     in june  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of this standard by the company did not materially impact its consolidated financial statements 
the company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks where natural hedging strategies cannot be effectively employed 
the majority of these contracts hedge the foreign currency risk related to net asset or liability positions denominated in german deutschmarks 
generally  these contracts have maturities less than one year and require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of the company s hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets  liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company s derivative activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments 
however  the company has entered into these instruments with creditworthy financial institutions and considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote
