item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first defiance is a unitary thrift holding company which conducts business through its subsidiaries  first federal  the leader and first insurance 
first federal is a federally chartered savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest ohio where it operates full service branches  including a branch in bowling green  ohio that opened in december first federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit  individual retirement accounts  real estate mortgage loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  home equity loans  and trust services 
the leader is a mortgage banking company that specializes in servicing loans originated under first time homebuyer programs 
under these programs  first time homebuyers are able to obtain loans at rates generally below market at the time of closing 
the funds for the loans are available as a result of bond issues through various state and local governmental units 
the leader  as master servicer under the bond programs  purchases the loans from the originator  principally other financial institutions or mortgage brokers 
once purchased by the leader  the loans under the specific bond programs are packaged and gnma securities are issued to the bond trustees under the programs 
as of december   the leader services approximately  bond program loans with balances of billion 
because the loans under the first time homebuyer programs are issued at below market rates  they generally have significantly lower pre payments than conventional mortgage loans 
the leader also collects a significant amount of ancillary fees  including late charges 
at december   total loans serviced by leader  including bond program loans  conventional loans and loans serviced for various third parties  consisted of  loans with a total balance of billion 
first insurance sells a variety of property and casualty group health and life insurance products and investment and annuity products 
because the first insurance acquisition occurred at the end of december  only the results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  and are impacted by this transaction 
financial condition total assets at december  were billion  an increase of from december  s total of million 
as a result of increased secondary market activity at the leader  mortgage servicing rights increased to million  as of december   from million  at december  due to the company s efforts to reduce the outstanding balance of loans held for sale  the december  balance of loans held for sale was million compared to million at december  additionally  loans held for sale which have been securitized in the normal course of the leader s operations and reported as trading securities decreased to  at december  from million at december  the growth in the leader s secondary marketing activities  and the corresponding growth in mortgage servicing rights  necessitated increased funding from outside banks 
warehouse and term notes payable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  excluding the leader s operations  gross loans receivable increased million  to million at december   from million as of december  this increase was the result of increases in the non residential real estate and commercial and home equity portfolios  partially offset by decreases in the single family residential and consumer portfolios 
non residential real estate and commercial loans increased million to million at december  from million as of december  home equity and improvement loans increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
single family residential loans decreased to million as of december  from million at december  additionally  consumer loans decreased million  to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company will continue to achieve increases in the non residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios due to an increased emphasis on this type of lending 
the year over year decrease in the consumer portfolios was anticipated by the company as a result of stricter underwriting standards that were implemented as a result of credit quality issues noted in december of the decrease in the mortgage portfolio resulted from decreased mortgage loan production  regular pay downs of the existing portfolio and sales of all qualifying fixed rate production into the secondary market 
first defiance also had growth in deposits for the year of million  to million at december  from million at december  the most significant increases were in money market demand accounts and noninterest bearing deposits 
money market demand accounts increased to million at december  from million at december  noninterest bearing deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  interest bearing checking accounts and certificates of deposit increased to million and million  respectively  at december  from million and million  respectively  at december  savings accounts decreased to million at december  from million at december  investment securities  which include available for sale  trading  and held to maturity securities  decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  as discussed above  the decrease was primarily the result of carrying million in trading securities as of december  related to the securitization of certain available for sale mortgage loans 
average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected first defiance s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii change in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total change in rate and volume 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

net income for was negatively impacted by a million pre tax million after tax and 
on a diluted per share basis fourth quarter adjustment to the reserve for loan losses 
see provision for loan losses 
on a diluted per share basis  first defiance s net income was   and 
for the years ended december   and  respectively 
earnings per share have been favorably impacted in both and by a reduction in average shares outstanding as a result of a number of share repurchase programs 
on a diluted basis  the average shares outstanding have declined from million in to million in and million in net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest margin was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest margin in is primarily a result of the financing required to support the million increase in average non interest earning assets from million for to million for the increase in average non interest earning assets was primarily the result of increases in the average balances in mortgage servicing rights and prepaid expenses and other assets 
mortgage servicing rights increased from an average of million for to million for the increase in average mortgage servicing rights corresponded with an increase in loan sales from billion during to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in the net interest margin in compared to resulted from similar downward pressures corresponding to the increase in average non interest earning assets which grew from million for to million for the yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   an increase from the years ended december  and when the yields on interest earning assets were and  respectively 
the increase in yields on interest earning assets from to was due to the increased non residential real estate and commercial loan production as well as general interest rate increases 
the decline in yields between and was primarily due to the addition of the leader s mortgage loans available for sale during the second half of and the subsequent increases in the average balance on these loans 
the company s cost of funds increased to for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the company s cost of funds was the result of several increases in the targeted federal funds rate as well as increased usage of external funding sources to finance the growth in mortgage banking activities 
as a result of the increase in the cost of funds outpacing the increase in average earning assets  the interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for and for the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for and million for for the year ended december  non interest income was million compared to million for and only million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for income for the leader for the twelve months ended december  and and the six months ended december  included in first defiance s results was million  million and million  respectively 
the growth in the balance of mortgage servicing rights at the leader has a negative impact on first federal s regulatory capital levels because the regulations require first federal to subtract the amount that mortgage servicing rights exceed core capital excluding this adjustment from core capital 
these disallowed mortgage servicing rights totaled million at december  this regulatory requirement has limited first defiance s ability to grow its core businesses and also repurchase common stock 
management is exploring a number of options to address this issue including the restructuring of its corporate organization  restructuring of certain assets on the balance sheet including the mortgage servicing rights  and the issuance of additional capital  either in the form of common equity or trust preferred securities 
implementation of any of these alternatives could decrease non interest income or increase interest expense or non interest expense 
net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie  the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for compared to the yield on those loans increased to in from in the increase in loans receivable was primarily attributable to the growth in the average balance of non residential real estate and commercial loans and the leader s loans held for sale 
the average balance of non residential real estate and commercial loans grew to million for from million for the average balance of loans held for sale increased to million for from million for the increases in loans held for sale and commercial loans were partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance on single family residential real estate loans  and a million decrease in the average balance on all consumer loans 
as discussed above  conventional mortgage loan production for was lower than due to the higher interest rate environment experience during and subsequent sale into the secondary market of all qualifying longer term fixed rate originations 
the decrease in the average balance on consumer loans was anticipated as underwriting standards were strengthened in response to credit quality problems noted in the portfolio in see provision for loan losses 
in  total interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans outstanding for when compared to the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of the leader s loans available for sale 
the average balance of these loans grew to million for from million for the yield on those loans declined to in versus in because of the low coupon on the leader s available for sale portfolio 
interest earnings from the investment portfolio and other interest bearing deposits increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was due to an increase in the average balance of securities and other interest bearing deposits from million in to million in the increase in average balance was primarily due to a million increase in the average outstanding balance on loans securitized and classified as trading securities from to the yield on the average portfolio balance in was 
in  the portfolio had a yield of with an average balance of million while in the investment portfolio had a yield of with an average balance of million 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in compared to million for this increase is due to the increase in the average interest bearing liabilities to million in from million in additionally  the average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities increased to during from during the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was the result of increased funding requirements relating to the loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights at the leader and the increased non residential real estate and commercial loan balances at first federal  net of the increase in average escrow deposits which are included in non interest bearing liabilities which increased to million in from million in the increase in the average cost of funds was the result of several federal reserve increases in the targeted federal funds rate during as well as increased usage of outside funding sources to finance the leader s mortgage banking activities 
the cost of the million average bank financing in was compared to the cost of the million average bank financing in of 
first defiance maintains warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions totaling million as of december  to supplement its other funding sources 
in  interest expense increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the increase is primarily due to the financing requirements of the leader s operations acquired in july of the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased to million during from million for  while the average cost of these borrowings only slightly decreased to from over that same time period 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin for the year ended december  declined to from for and for the decline was due to the financing of the leader  particularly the financing of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill  which are both non interest earning assets 
the balance of mortgage servicing rights at december  was million and the balance of goodwill at that date was million 
provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that is deemed appropriate by management 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  industry standards  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of first defiance s loan portfolio 
the growth in non residential real estate and commercial loans and a change in the leader s method of estimating the required reserve for potential losses on foreclosure loans contributed to the increased provision for the year ended december  as compared to the growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans of million during resulted in a provision for loan losses of million on all non residential real estate and commercial loans  compared to  during the year ended december  during the first quarter of  management changed its method of estimating the required reserve for potential losses on foreclosure loans to more accurately reflect the total risk inherent in the servicing and loan portfolios at the leader 
this resulted in a one time increase in the provision for loan losses of  the consolidated allowance for loan losses at december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  in  four factors combined to require the large increase in the loan loss provision an increase in charge offs and delinquencies within first federal s consumer loan portfolio  rapid growth in first federal s non residential real estate and commercial loan portfolio  the status of first federal s mobile home loan portfolio  and the acquisition of the leader 
during  in response to the level of charge offs and internal and external reviews of the consumer loan portfolio  management increased the allowance for consumer loans by approximately million 
additionally  during when the balance of non residential real estate and commercial loans increased from million to million  the related allowance for loan losses increased by  first federal also reserved against the then remaining mobile home loan balances not already classified as doubtful or loss 
this adjustment resulted in increasing the mobile home loan loss allowance to million at december  in may of  first federal sold the remaining mobile home portfolio  which had a net book value after deducting the related reserve of million  for million 
finally  during the last six months of  there was a  increase in the provision for loan losses as a result of the acquisition of the leader 
during the year ended december   the leader recorded a provision for loan losses of million  excluding the one time charge discussed above 
most of the loans that are originated or acquired by the leader have fha insurance or va guarantees 
as a result  the risk of loss on those loans is limited to the legal costs associated with foreclosure on the loan  which has averaged approximately  per loan in foreclosure 
this is a cost that the leader incurs whether the loan is included in leader s own portfolio or serviced for others 
the leader reserves for the foreclosure losses when the loan goes to foreclosure 
management also records an estimated loss reserve to provide for potential losses as loans become delinquent based on the leader s historical loss experience on similar loans 
the leader recorded a provision of million and  in and  respectively 
total non performing loans were million  or 
of total loans  as of december   compared with million  or 
of total loans  as of december   and million  or 
of total loans  as of december  total charge offs were million  million  and million for the periods ended december    and  respectively 
over the same periods  recoveries amounted to   and  respectively 
non interest income the margin reductions were more than offset by growth in non interest income  which increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non interest income for the year ended december  was only million 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million in mortgage banking income compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in mortgage banking income is directly related to the growth in the loan servicing portfolio 
the total principal balance outstanding on loans serviced for others excluding loans subserviced for others was billion  billion  and billion as of december    and  respectively 
because of increased demand for first time homebuyer loans in the rising interest rate environment exprienced in  loans purchased and sold increased to billion in from billion in this increased activity resulted in increased gains on sale of mortgage loans  which increased to million for from million in and million in primarily due to increased loan production and sales 
the leader also realized a one time gain on the sale of non core mortgage servicing rights totaling  in the results also include the revenue associated with first insurance  which was formed from the merger of the stauffer mendenhall agency acquired december  and the defiance  ohio office of insurance and risk management acquired september  
total revenues for first insurance were million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the growth in this revenue was due to the acquisition of the second agency during the third quarter 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as with non interest income  the addition of the leader in july significantly increased the consolidated level of non interest expense 
for the six months from july to december   the leader s total non interest expense was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase from to was primarily due to compensation and benefit expense that increased by million over of this increase  million related to compensation and benefits at the leader  million related to compensation and benefits for first insurance and million related to increases in compensation and benefits at first federal 
the increase in compensation and benefits at the leader were driven by increases in staff and in sales commissions to reflect the increased production and portfolio levels 
the first federal increase was due to increases in staffing levels resulting from branch and commercial expansions  including the opening of de novo branches in findlay  ohio in february  fostoria  ohio in november and bowling green  ohio in december the first insurance increase was the result of the september acquisition of the defiance  ohio office of insurance and risk management 
in addition to compensation expense  amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the increase in amortization of mortgage servicing rights related to the billion increase in loans serviced for others during finally  in  occupancy expense increased  over the expense  due to expansion at all of the subsidiaries 
the comparability of the years ended december  and is greatly impacted by the july acquisition of the leader 
the leader acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in the inclusion of leader s results only for the six months from the acquisition date to the end of the year 
included in the non interest expenses for the leader are million in compensation and benefits million for the second half of  million in occupancy costs  for the second half of  million in amortization of mortgage servicing rights million for the second half of  and million in amortization of goodwill and other acquisition costs  including non compete and employment agreements million for the second half of 
income taxes income tax amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates for the three years were   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is the result of the increase in non taxable interest income and a reduction of income at the holding company level that is subject to state income tax 
cash earnings the selected financial data presented in the following table highlights the performance of first defiance on a cash basis for each of the three years in the period ended december  the data has been adjusted to exclude the amortization of goodwill and the related tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill 
this goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of the leader  and the insurance agencies which were combined to form first insurance 
all three acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the amortization of goodwill does not result in a cash expense and has essentially no economic impact on liquidity and funds management activity 
cash basis financial data provide an additional basis for measuring a company s ability to support future growth  pay dividends  and repurchase shares 
the cash basis data presented in the table below has not been adjusted to exclude the impact of other noncash items such as depreciation  the provision for loan losses  and amortization of mrp and esop expense

return on average equity ratio of cash operating expense to tangible assets goodwill goodwill average balance    goodwill amortization after tax concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
credit risk is increased by lending or investing activities that concentrate a financial institution s assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of related occurrences 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower  and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
liquidity and capital resources first federal is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of united states treasury  agency and other investments having maturities of five years or less 
ots regulations require that savings institutions maintain liquid assets not less than of their average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
first federal s liquidity exceeded applicable requirements at december  cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  cash was generated by first defiance s operating activities during the year ended december  primarily as a result of net income 
in and  the company used more cash in operating activities than was provided 
this resulted from the net growth in the held for sale loan portfolio which was funded through financing activities 
the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  goodwill amortization  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop  the origination of mortgage servicing rights and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operations and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payments on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of securities 
in cash provided from the sale and maturity of investment securities totaled million  while million in additional securities were purchased 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits and advance payments from loan servicing customers  the utilization of fhlb advances  and borrowings from other bank sources 
for the year ended december   fhlb advances decreased by million  warehouse and term notes payable increased by million  and deposits increased by million 
for additional information about cash flows from first defiance s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   first defiance had an aggregate of million in unfunded commitments to originate loans including unused portions of lines of credit and letters of credit and no commitments to purchase securities 
at the same date  first defiance had commitments to sell million of loans held for sale 
at that date first defiance had commitments to acquire million of mortgage loans under first time homebuyer programs  all of which have offsetting commitments for sale into the secondary market as gnma or fnma mortgage backed securities 
also as of december   the total amount of certificates of deposit that were scheduled to mature by december  was million 
first defiance believes that it has adequate resources to fund commitments as they arise 
it can adjust the rate on savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage or non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances 
because the fhlb requires that the collateral must exceed of the outstanding advance balance  first defiance may also from time to time be required to utilize other sources of financing  including brokered certificates of deposit and bank advances 
at december  first defiance had million of lines available from other financial institutions  of which million is being utilized 
stockholders equity increased by million  or  at december  compared to december  net income for was million  of which million was returned to shareholders in the form of declared dividends 
per share 
the increase in the market value of available for sale securities increased equity by million 
the vesting of mrp shares and release of esop shares increased equity by  and  respectively 
stock option exercises increased equity by approximately  the purchase of  shares of stock for treasury reduced equity by  the book value of first defiance s common stock was per share at december   compared to per share at december  the tangible book value excluding goodwill per share was and at december  and first federal is subject to various capital requirements of the office of thrift supervision 
at december   first federal had capital ratios that exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements 
for additional information about first federal s capital requirements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  using projected amounts as a base case  first defiance s net interest income would decrease by 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would increase by 
the acquisition of the leader provided first defiance with a significant source of non interest income 
the mortgage banking operations also serve as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising rate environment because increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the mortgage servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments on the underlying loans 
however  because the leader s portfolio is comprised primarily of below market rate loans  the prepayments on the loans it services have been much lower than industry averages 
the leader averaged prepayments for the year ended december   which is lower than the prepayment speeds for the mortgage industry as a whole and lower than the and rates experienced by the leader during and  respectively 
the simulation model used by first defiance measures the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income only 
the company also monitors the potential change in the value of its mortgage servicing portfolio given the same basis point shift in interest rates 
at december   a basis point decrease in interest rates would require first defiance to establish additional reserves for impairment of mortgage servicing rights of approximately  first defiance  through the leader  has significantly increased its origination capabilities  on both a retail and wholesale basis 
loan production at the leader was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  mortgage servicing rights increased from million as of december  to million as of december  to protect themselves from the risk of changing interest rates  mortgage banking companies frequently use off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge the exposure of the mortgage loan pipeline 
the leader does not need to hedge its mortgage loan pipeline because the trustees under the various first time homebuyer programs are required to fund the issuance of the gnma securities backed by the mortgages in the leader s pipeline at a guaranteed price 
first defiance also has increased its lending activities in the non residential real estate and commercial loan area 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential real estate and commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal has been selling fixed rate mortgage loans with a maturity of years or greater in the secondary market 
historically  loans with maturities less than years have been retained in portfolio although first federal began selling its year fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market beginning in january in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also utilizes the market value of net portfolio equity npv methodology adopted by the ots 
under the npv methodology  interest rate risk exposure irr is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in first federal s net interest income nii and npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates simultaneously rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of nii and npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented in the following table  as of december   is an analysis of estimated interest rate risk of first federal and the leader as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates up and down basis points in point increments 
assumptions used in calculating the amounts in this table are generally those assumptions utilized by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of the thrifts it regulates 
however  first defiance utilizes a model that evaluates the market value of mortgage servicing rights on a loan by loan basis  and management believes that the results generated by that model are more accurate than the generic ots assumptions 
for purposes of this table  management s valuation of mortgage servicing rights have been substituted for ots results 
npv is calculated by the ots for the purposes of interest rate risk assessment and should not be considered as an indicator of value of first federal 
december  net portfolio value as of net portfolio value present value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp  bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp in the event of a basis point change in interest rates based upon estimates as of december   first federal would experience a decrease in npv in a declining rate environment and a decrease in npv in a rising rate environment 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
mortgage servicing rights act as a natural hedge to these changes in value of other monetary assets as mortgage servicing rights generally rise in value in a rising rate environment and decline in value in a falling rate environment because of the prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the npv methodology  the decline in npv in a rising rate environment is because first federal has used fhlb advances and deposits with shorter terms than the assets in which it invests 
the decline in npv in a falling rate environment is because of the reduction in value in mortgage servicing rights 
the analysis indicates that increases or decreases in monetary assets and increases or decreases in mortgage servicing rights generally offset each other in both rising and falling rate environments 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates
