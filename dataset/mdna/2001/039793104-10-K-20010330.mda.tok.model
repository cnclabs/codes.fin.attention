item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that owns  manages  leases  develops  renovates and acquires commercial properties located in southern california 
we are a full service real estate organization managed by senior executive officers who have experience in the real estate industry ranging from to years and who collectively have an average of years experience 
we perform all property management  construction management  accounting  finance and acquisition activities and a majority of our leasing transactions with our staff of approximately employees 
as of december   we are southern california s largest publicly traded office landlord as measured by total net rentable square feet owned 
as of that date  our portfolio consisted of primarily suburban office properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet and three properties with approximately  net rentable square feet under development 
as of december   our properties were approximately leased 
our primary business strategy is to actively manage our portfolio to achieve gains in rental rates and occupancy  control operating expenses and to maximize income from ancillary operations and services 
when market conditions permit  we may also selectively develop or acquire new properties that add value and fit strategically into our portfolio 
we may also sell existing mature or slow growth properties and redeploy the proceeds into investments that we believe will generate higher yields 
results of operations our financial position and operating results are primarily comprised of our portfolio of commercial properties and income derived from those properties 
therefore  the comparability of financial data from period to period will be affected by the timing of significant property renovations  development  acquisitions and dispositions

interest and other income increased by approximately  in as compared to  primarily due to increases in management fees for owner associations we manage and from higher interest income earned in on higher restricted cash balances required by mortgage loans entered into after january general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue  in as compared to million  or of total revenue  in this increase was primarily related to higher personnel costs in  including approximately  in non cash compensation expense from restricted stock awards granted to several key executives 
interest expense increased approximately million in as compared to this increase was primarily due to both higher outstanding balances in resulting from the funding of acquisitions  tenant improvement  leasing commission costs and development and renovation projects placed in service during the periods presented  and higher average interest rates in depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million in  primarily due to depreciation related to properties acquired in  newly developed and renovated properties  and capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions placed in service in variances for revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses the increase in revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses in as compared to was partially due to the four properties we acquired during  a development property placed in service in the third quarter of  a property sold in the fourth quarter of and the five properties under renovation for all or a portion of the periods presented 
operating results for properties under renovation may significantly vary from period to period depending on the status of the renovation and occupancy levels maintained during the renovation 
following is a summary of the increase in revenue from rental operations and property operating expenses that relates to the eleven properties that were either acquired  sold or placed in service after january  or were under renovation for all or a portion of the period beginning after january  and for the non renovation properties we owned for all and in thousands  except number of properties

year ended december  dollar percent change change gaap basis revenue from rental operations    property expenses    cash basis revenue from rental operations    property expenses    number of properties average occupancy net rentable square feet   excludes straight line rent adjustments 
revenue from rental operations for these properties  computed on a gaap basis  increased by approximately million  or  during  compared to approximately million of this increase was from rental revenue  of which million was related to scheduled rents and million was from straight line rent 
approximately of the increase in scheduled rents was due to increases in rental rates in and the remaining was related to higher average occupancy in the increase in straight line rent was primarily due to new leases and extensions signed with higher rental rate escalations than in revenue from rental operations was also higher due to an approximate million increase in tenant reimbursements  a million increase in parking income net of an approximate million decrease in other revenue from rental operations 
in addition to recoveries of approximately  from increases in utility rates for our san diego properties  tenant reimbursements and parking income primarily increased due to the approximate increase in average occupancy in  while other rental operations decreased primarily due to lower lease termination settlement fees in excluding only the straight line rent adjustment for these properties  revenue from rental operations computed on a cash basis  increased by approximately million or 
property operating expenses for these properties increased by approximately million  or  during  compared to  primarily due to higher real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  contingent ground rent and property administrative expenses in real estate taxes increased by approximately million in due to normal annual increases and final assessments on certain properties 
repairs and maintenance increased by  primarily due to the increase in average occupancy in ground rent expense increased by  due to higher operating income from one of our properties with a participating ground lease 
property administrative expenses  comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  were approximately  higher in  primarily due to our continued focus on raising our portfolio wide occupancy 
utility costs increased by approximately  in due to both higher average occupancy and rate increases for our san diego properties  partially offset by savings achieved from energy enhancing capital improvements completed during comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  in thousands  except number of properties and percentages year ended december  dollar percent change change revenue revenue from rental operations rental    tenant reimbursements    parking  net of expense    other rental operations    total    interest and other income   total revenue    expenses property expenses repairs and maintenance    utilities    real estate taxes    insurance   ground rent administrative    total property expenses    general and administrative   interest    depreciation and amortization    total expenses    other data number of properties acquired during period owned at end of period net rentable square feet acquired during period  owned at end of period   the increase in revenue from rental operations and property expenses in is primarily from properties acquired during and the amounts do not include a full year of operations for the properties we acquired during or for the four properties we acquired during following is a summary of the increase in revenue from rental operations and property expenses that relate to the properties that we acquired during and and for the properties we owned for all of and in thousands  except number of properties

interest expense increased approximately million in as compared to this increase was due to higher outstanding debt balances in  primarily to fund property acquisitions and tenant improvement build outs  which was partially offset by slightly lower effective interest rates in depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million in  primarily due to the properties we acquired in and properties owned for all of and following is a comparison of property operating data computed on a gaap basis and cash basis for the non renovation properties we owned for the entire twelve months ended december  and in thousands  except number of properties and percentages 
years ended december ended dollar percent change change gaap basis revenue from rental operations    property expenses    net    cash basis revenue from rental operations    property expenses    net    number of properties average occupancy net rentable square feet   excludes straight line rent adjustments 
revenue from rental operations for the properties we owned for all of and computed on a gaap basis increased by approximately million in compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in rental rates and a four percentage point increase in average occupancy in for this pool of properties representing approximately million net rentable square feet 
this increase in occupancy not only contributed to higher rental revenue but also resulted in higher tenant expense reimbursements  parking income and miscellaneous tenant charges 
miscellaneous tenant charges include revenue from after hour utility billings  signage  satellite income and lease termination settlements 
lease termination settlements totaled approximately million in compared to million in for these properties 
excluding only the straight line rent adjustments for these properties  revenue from rental operations  computed on a cash basis  increased by approximately million for the reasons described above 
property operating expenses for these properties increased by approximately million in compared to  primarily due to higher repairs  maintenance and administrative and overhead expenses 
these increases were primarily related to the four percentage point increase in average occupancy in liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to improved operating results for the properties we owned for all of and  as well as the net operating results of the eleven properties we developed  renovated or acquired subsequent to january  cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to million used in to acquire four properties which was partially offset by an increase of approximately million used in for capital expenditures related to our increased development and renovation activity and additional costs associated with tenant improvement build outs resulting from occupancy gains achieved in cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million  as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the timing of an equity issuance 
in september  we issued million in series b cumulative redeemable preferred operating units 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net proceeds from our offerings of unsecured senior notes  partially offset by repayments of mortgage loans  paydowns of our unsecured lines of credit and distributions to our stockholders and minority interests 
capital commitments as of december   we had approximately million outstanding in capital commitments related to tenant improvements  development and property related capital expenditures 
we expect to fund short term capital commitments through cash flow generated by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales or proceeds from our lines of credit 
available borrowings  cash balances and capital resources on may   we extended our unsecured line of credit with a group of banks led by wells fargo 
the extended line of credit provides for borrowings up to million with an option to increase the amount to million and bears interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus including an annual facility fee ranging from 
to 
based on the aggregate amount of the facility depending on our unsecured debt rating 
in addition  as long as we maintain an unsecured debt rating of bbb baa or better  the agreement contains a competitive bid option  whereby the lenders under this line of credit may bid on the interest rate to be charged for up to million of the unsecured line of credit 
under certain circumstances  we also have the option to convert the interest rate on this line of credit to the prime rate plus 
this line of credit matures in april as of december   there was approximately million outstanding on this line of credit and approximately million was available for additional borrowings 
in july  we closed on a million unsecured line of credit with lehman brothers 
borrowings on this new line of credit bear interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus  depending on our unsecured debt rating 
we also have the option to convert the interest rate to the prime rate plus 
this line of credit matures in july with an option to extend the maturity date for one year 
proceeds from this line of credit have been used to reduce the outstanding balance under our million line of credit 
as of december   there was million outstanding on this line of credit 
in august  we extended our unsecured line of credit with a total commitment of million from city national bank to august this line of credit accrues interest at the city national bank prime rate less 
as of december   there was an outstanding balance of million on this line of credit  and million was available for additional borrowing 
proceeds from this line of credit have been used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and provide for working capital and other purposes 
as of december  we had million available under our unsecured lines of credit 
on march   we issued million of senior unsecured notes in two tranches 
one tranche was for million at an interest rate of due in march and the other tranche was for million at an interest rate of due in march these notes are our senior unsecured obligations and pay interest semi annually on march  and september  of each year 
net proceeds from this offering were used to repay two prepayable term loans to an affiliate of lehman brothers and a mortgage loan and to reduce the outstanding balance under our unsecured lines of credit 
these senior unsecured notes were issued in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by rule a under the securities act 
we subsequently filed a registration statement that became effective on may  and all privately placed notes were exchanged for notes registered under the securities act 
on november   we completed a private placement of million senior notes due in november  with interest payable semi annually on november and may of each year 
we used the net proceeds from this private placement to reduce the outstanding balance on one of our unsecured lines of credit and to repay a construction loan related to our development of the center drive project 
these senior unsecured notes were issued in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by rule a under the securities act 
we subsequently filed a registration statement that became effective on march  and are currently exchanging these privately placed notes for registered notes 
we expect to complete this exchange offer by april  the following is a summary of scheduled principal payments for our total outstanding indebtedness as of december  in thousands year amount thereafter  total  consists primarily of million outstanding on our lehman brothers line of credit which has a one year extension 
consists primarily of million outstanding on our wells fargo line of credit 
the following is other information related to our indebtedness as of december  in thousands  except percentage and interest rate data unsecured and secured debt percent of weighted average balance total debt interest rate unsecured debt  secured debt  total weighted average  floating and fixed rate debt percent of weighted average balance total debt interest rate floating rate  fixed rate  total weighted average  includes amortization of prepaid financing costs 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash  including million in interest bearing cash deposits required by some of our mortgage loans payable 
in addition  we had million in cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by several of our mortgage loans payable 
we may sell mature or slow growth assets over the next twelve to twenty four months 
due to market conditions beyond our control  it is difficult to predict the actual period and amount of these asset sales 
at the time any such sales proceeds are realized  we expect to redeploy such amounts into investments that we believe will generate higher yields  which may include development of office buildings  acquisitions or repurchase of our common stock 
in addition  we expect to use a portion of any proceeds to pay down portions of our debt in order to maintain our conservative leverage and coverage ratios 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from our lines of credit or proceeds from asset sales 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to pay any distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short terms liquidity needs over the next twelve months  including recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity and capital requirements such as scheduled principal repayments  development costs  property acquisitions  if any  and other non recurring capital expenditures through net cash provided by operations  refinancing of existing indebtedness  proceeds from asset sales and or the issuance of long term debt and equity securities 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution the following table reflects the calculation of our funds from operations for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  funds from operations net income    depreciation and amortization    minority interest    gain on disposition of property  distributions on preferred operating partnership   units funds from operations    arden realty s share percentage arden realty s share of funds from operations 
   funds available for distribution funds from operations    straight line rent adjustment    capital expenditure  tenant improvement and leasing commission reserve    funds available for distribution    weighted average shares common operating partnership units outstanding diluted    we consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  to be a useful financial measure of our operating performance 
we believe that funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate our ability to service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our financial performance  as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 
funds from operations also is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to service our debt 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines funds from operations as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper which may differ from the standards used by other reits and  accordingly  our funds from operations may not be comparable to other reits 
excludes  in distributions made to the former minority partners in the world savings office property 
includes  in non cash compensation expense 
funds available for distribution consists of funds from operations  excluding straight line rent adjustments and less a reserve for capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions current economic climate our short and long term liquidity is significantly impacted by the operating results of our properties  all of which are located in southern california 
our ability to lease available space and increase rates when leases expire is largely dependent on the demand for office space in the markets where our properties are located 
national and local economic trends may affect demand for our properties 
the timing and extent of changes in the national and local economy and their effects on our properties and results of operations are difficult to accurately predict 
some sectors of the national and california economy  particularly the sectors containing technology and internet companies  are reported to be experiencing slower growth  reduced earnings or increased losses 
problems associated with deregulation of the electric industry in california have resulted in intermittent service interruptions and significantly higher costs in some areas of the state 
as of the date of this form k  we have not noted any material trends or effects arising from these national and regional issues on our ability to lease and renew available space  to increase rental rates as leases expire and to collect amounts due from our tenants 
it is possible  however  that these national and regional issues may more directly affect us and our operating results in the future  making it more difficult for us to lease and renew available space  to increase or maintain rental rates as leases expire and to collect amounts due from our tenants 
see risk factors our operating performance and property values will be affected by changes in the economic climate in southern california  the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow  and rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
forward looking statements this form k  including the documents incorporated herein by reference  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act pertaining to  among other things  our future results of operations  cash available for distribution  acquisitions  lease renewals  property development  property renovation  capital requirements and general business  industry and economic conditions applicable to us 
also  documents we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission and incorporated herein by reference will contain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and the matters set forth or incorporated in this form k generally 
we caution you  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive  particularly with respect to future filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure or loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
interest rate risk 
even though we currently have no such agreements  in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may use a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
some of our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates of interest  such as libor 
based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december   a increase in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured notes receivable would not have a material impact on annual future earnings  cash flows and the fair value of the secured notes receivable 
the weighted average interest rate on our floating debt as of december  was our fixed rate debt totaled million as of december  with a weighted average interest rate of 
and an unrealized loss of approximately million for a total fair value of approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of fixed rate debt would decrease its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact on annual future earnings and cash flows 
a increase in interest rates in our million of fixed rate debt would increase its fair value by approximately million and would not have an impact of annual future earnings and cash flows 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  however  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k readers should carefully consider the following risk factors 
real estate investment risks an inability to retain tenants or rent space upon lease expirations may adversely affect our ability to service our debt 
through   leases  including month to month leases comprising of our leased net rentable square footage and of our annualized base rents at december  will expire as follows number percentage of percentage of of leases aggregate portfolio aggregate portfolio year expiring leased square feet annualized base rent if we are unable to promptly relet or renew leases for all or a substantial portion of this space  or if the rent upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected  our cash flow and business could be adversely affected 
our operating performance and property values will be affected by changes in the economic climate in southern california 
all of our properties are located in southern california 
our revenue and the value of our properties may be affected by a number of factors that are unique to or particularly affect the southern california economy and real estate market  which may adversely affect our business 
competition affects occupancy levels rents and cost of land which could adversely affect our revenues 
many office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of the competing properties may be newer  better located or owned by parties better capitalized than we are 
although ownership of these competing properties is currently diversified among many different types  from publicly traded companies and institutional investors to small enterprises and individual owners  and no one or group of owners currently dominate or significantly influence the market  consolidation of owners could create efficiencies and marketing advantages for the consolidated group that could adversely affect us 
these competitive advantages  the number of competitors and the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the rents we can charge  our ability to lease space in our existing properties or at newly acquired or developed properties and the prices we have to pay for developable land 
the financial condition and solvency of our tenants may reduce our cash flow 
tenants may experience a downturn in their business which may cause them to miss rental payments when due or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of their leases or a delay in recovering possession of their premises 
although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies  we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
that illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended  may under specified circumstances impose a prohibited transaction tax on the profits derived from our sale of properties held for fewer than four years  which could affect our ability to sell our properties 
rising energy costs and power outages in california may have an adverse effect on our operations and revenue 
problems associated with deregulation of the electric industry in california have resulted in intermittent service interruptions and significantly higher costs in some areas 
approximately of our buildings and approximately of the total net rentable square footage of our portfolio are located within municipalities that either do not produce their own power or have not entered into long term fixed price contracts 
these properties may be subject to intermittent service interruptions or significant rate increases from their utility providers 
the remaining portion of our portfolio is located in areas that are not expected to be subject to intermittent electric service interruptions and significant electric rate increases 
approximately of our buildings and of the total net rentable square footage of our portfolio are subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs 
the remainder of our leases provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount 
we estimate that we will be able to recover approximately of any utility cost increases from our tenants 
although we have not experienced any material losses resulting from electric deregulation  it is possible that some of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant electric rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy problems in california continue 
increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our revenue 
except for our triple net leases  we may not be able to pass all real estate tax increases through to some of our tenants 
therefore  any tax increases may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
our properties are also subject to various federal  california and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act  and california and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with these regulatory requirements 
we cannot assure you  however  that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions and to our business 
we may acquire properties through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties that could result in financial dependency and management conflicts 
although we currently do not have plans to do so  we may participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships in the future 
depending on the characteristics and business objectives of the joint venture or partnership  we may not have voting control over the joint venture or partnership 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present  including o our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  o our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and o our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
neither the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our governing documents prevent us from participating in joint ventures with our affiliates 
because a joint venture with an affiliate may not be negotiated in a traditional arm s length transaction  terms of the joint venture may not be as favorable to us as we could obtain if we entered into a joint venture with an outside third party 
we may not be able to integrate or finance our acquisitions 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including building systems not operating as expected  delay in or failure to lease vacant space and tenants failing to renew leases as they expire 
in addition  our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing accounting systems and property management structure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with that integration or effectively manage additional properties or that newly acquired properties will perform as expected 
changing market conditions  including competition from other purchasers of suburban office properties  may diminish our opportunities for attractive additional acquisitions 
moreover  acquisition costs of a property may exceed original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical 
our acquisitions and renovations may not perform as expected 
although we currently have no plans to significantly expand or renovate our properties  we may do so in the future 
expansion and renovation projects may inconvenience and displace existing tenants  require us to engage in time consuming up front planning and engineering activities and expend capital  and require us to obtain various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
while our policies with respect to expansion and renovation activities are intended to limit some of the risks otherwise associated with these activities  we will nevertheless incur risks  including expenditures of funds on  and devotion of our time to  projects that may not be completed 
our development activities may be more expensive than anticipated and may not yield our anticipated results 
we currently have three properties under development at the howard hughes center in los angeles  california 
the estimated total costs for these three properties is approximately million 
in addition  we have preliminary architectural designs completed for additional build to suit buildings at the howard hughes center and have completed preliminary designs on a build to suit office building at our long beach airport business park  but do not intend to commence construction on any of these projects until development plans and budgets are finalized and build to suit tenant leases are signed with terms allowing us to achieve yields commensurate with the project s development risk 
we also intend to review  from time to time  other opportunities for developing and constructing office buildings and other commercial properties in accordance with our development and underwriting policies 
we expect to finance our development activities over the next months through net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset sales or proceeds from our lines of credit 
risks associated with our development activities may include o abandonment of development opportunities due to a lack of financing or other reasons  o construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical  o occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  o construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and o development activities would also be subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
we are not subject to any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any single property or any single geographic area 
our governing documents do not restrict the amount or percentage of our assets that we may invest in a single property or geographic area 
all of our properties are currently in southern california and we have no immediate plans to invest outside of southern california 
this lack of diversification in our investments makes us more highly susceptible to changes affecting the southern california economy and real estate markets or damages from regional events such as earthquakes 
we may not be able to expand into new markets successfully 
while our business is currently limited to the southern california market  it is possible that we will in the future expand our business to new geographic markets 
we will not initially possess the same level of familiarity with new markets outside of southern california  which could adversely affect our ability to manage  lease  develop or acquire properties in new localities 
financing risks our significant amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately billion  consisting of approximately million in secured debt and approximately million of unsecured debt 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our substantial indebtedness could o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisition and development activity and other business purposes  o make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  o limit our ability to refinance our debt and obtain additional debt financing  and o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and real estate industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the real estate industry 
we may be able to incur substantially more debt which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
despite current indebtedness levels  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future 
neither the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership nor our charter or bylaws limit the amount or the percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow up to a maximum of million under our three lines of credit 
in addition  we have the option to increase our million unsecured line of credit by million 
if we exercised the option  we would be able to borrow up to million under our three lines of credit 
as of december   we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately million under these three lines of credit 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify and could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 
our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest when due 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness  which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity  and  if we can refinance  the terms of the refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
as of december   approximately million of principal will be coming due over the next twelve months 
if principal payments cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt and continue to service and repay our debt obligations 
rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
an increase in prevailing interest rates would have an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt was variable rate debt 
increases in interest rates would also impact the refinancing of our fixed rate debt 
if interest rates are higher when our fixed debt becomes due  we may be forced to borrow at the higher rates 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including the exchange notes 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase our risks as to the other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements could be unenforceable 
as of december   we were not a party to any such agreements 
many of our properties are subject to mortgage financing which could result in foreclosure if we are unable to pay or refinance the mortgages when due 
we currently have outstanding five mortgage financings totaling million that are secured by of our properties 
the properties in each of these financings are fully cross collateralized and cross defaulted 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross defaulted  a default in one mortgage will trigger a default in the other mortgages 
the cross defaults can give the lender a number of remedies depending on the circumstances such as the right to increase the interest rate  demand additional collateral  accelerate the maturity date of the mortgages or foreclose on and sell the properties 
to the extent two or more mortgages are cross collateralized  a default in one mortgage will allow the mortgage lender to foreclose upon and sell the properties that are not the primary collateral for the loan in default 
five additional properties are subject to single property mortgages totaling approximately million at december  if we are unable to meet our obligations under these mortgages  we could be forced to pay higher interest rates or provide additional collateral or the properties subject to the mortgages could be foreclosed upon and sold  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations 
tax risks our desire to qualify as a reit restricts our ability to accumulate cash that might be used in future periods to make debt payments or to fund future growth 
in order to qualify as a reit and avoid federal income tax liability  we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income  beginning january  excluding net capital gain  and to avoid income taxation  our distributions must not be less than of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
to avoid excise tax liability  our distributions to our shareholders for the year must exceed the sum of of its ordinary income  of its capital gain net income  and any undistributed taxable income from prior years 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
accordingly  these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on our debt obligations and to fund future growth 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership  but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify 
our operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
however  if the operating partnership were a publicly traded partnership  it would be treated as a corporation instead of a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless at least of its income is qualifying income as defined in the internal revenue code 
the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this test are similar in most respects 
qualifying income for the test generally includes passive income  such as specified types of real property rents  dividends and interest 
we believe that the operating partnership would meet this test  but we cannot guarantee that it would 
if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation  it would incur substantial tax liabilities and we would fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that since our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
although we believe that we have been and will continue to be organized and have operated and will continue to operate so as to qualify for taxation as a reit  we cannot assure you that we have been or will continue to be organized or operated in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
for us to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and tests regarding various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within arden realty s control 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit  like us  that hold our assets through an investment in a partnership 
no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of qualification 
we are  however  not aware of any pending legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a reit 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  asset diversification  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests imposed under the internal revenue code  the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by our tax counsel 
if we failed to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
if we were disqualified as a reit  our ability to raise additional capital could be significantly impaired 
this could reduce the funds we would have available to pay distributions to our stockholders and to service our debt 
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  if we have net income from a prohibited transaction  specifically sales or other taxable dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  that income will be subject to a tax 
other risks we are subject to agreements and policies that may deter change in control offers that might be attractive to our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws as well as our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  may delay  defer or prevent a third party from making offers to acquire us or control over us 
for example  such provisions may o deter tender offers for our common stock  which offers may be attractive to the stockholders  and o deter purchases of large blocks of common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock over then prevailing market prices 
our charter contains a provision designed to prevent a concentration of ownership among our stockholders that would cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
under the internal revenue code  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of common stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals  including specific kinds of entities  at any time during the last half of our taxable year 
in addition  if we  or an owner of or more of our common stock  actually or constructively owns or more of a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  the rent received by us from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
in order to protect us against the risk of losing reit status  the ownership limit included in our charter limits actual or constructive ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock by any single stockholder to  by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the then outstanding shares of common stock 
actual or constructive ownership of shares of common stock in excess of the ownership limit will cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void with respect to the transferee or owner as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit and such shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations 
that transferee or owner will have no right to vote such shares or be entitled to dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares 
although our board of directors presently has no intention of doing so  except as described below  our board of directors could waive this restriction with respect to a particular stockholder if it were satisfied  based upon the advice of counsel or a ruling from the internal revenue service  that ownership by such stockholder in excess of the ownership limit would not jeopardize our status as a reit and our board of directors otherwise decided such action would be in our best interests 
our board of directors has waived our ownership limit with respect to mr 
ziman and certain family members and affiliates and has permitted these parties to actually and constructively own up to of the outstanding shares of common stock 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to cause us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or classify any unissued and reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of preferred stock and  with respect to the preferred stock  to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time  it could establish a series of preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors of each class are chosen for three year terms upon the expiration of their current terms and each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders 
the staggered terms of directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in august  we declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock 
subject to limited exceptions  these rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  each right will entitle stockholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of our newly created class a junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of our board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at 
per right at any time before a person has acquired or more of the outstanding common stock 
the rights plan will expire in august each right entitles its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of our common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the person or group seeking to acquire or more of our common stock will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction which has not been approved by our board of directors  each right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at that time of twice the right s exercise price 
we may change policies without stockholder approval 
our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies and our policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  debt  capitalization and operations  will be determined by our management 
although we have no present intention to do so  these policies could be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our management and board of directors without a vote of our stockholders 
in addition  we may change policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that the changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and market price of our common stock 
losses in excess of our insurance coverage or uninsured losses could adversely affect our cash flow 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance policies which currently cover all of our properties with specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances 
some losses  however  are generally not insured against because it is not economically feasible to do so 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property and  in the case of debt which is recourse to us  we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss would adversely affect our cash flow with respect to the property subject to the loss 
moreover  we would generally be liable for any unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations with respect to the property subject to the loss 
an earthquake could adversely affect our business 
all of our properties are located in southern california which is a high risk geographical area for earthquakes 
depending upon its magnitude  an earthquake could severely damage our properties which would adversely affect our business 
we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties and the resulting business interruption 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient if there is a major earthquake 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
these costs may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to remediate the contamination on the property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow against the property 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by that person 
some laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
finally  third parties may have claims against the owner of the site based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
specific federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose liability for release of asbestos containing material and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials 
in connection with the ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for those costs 
in the past few years  independent environmental consultants have conducted or updated phase i environmental assessments and other environmental investigations as appropriate at some of our properties 
these environmental site assessments and investigations have included  among other things  a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding area and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents 
soil and groundwater samplings were performed where warranted 
the environmental site assessments and investigations have identified a total of properties in our portfolio  representing approximately of the total net rentable square feet of the portfolio  affected by environmental concerns 
these environmental concerns include properties that may be impacted by known or suspected a contamination caused by third party sources or b soil and or groundwater contamination which has been or is being remediated  and c those containing underground storage tanks  asbestos  or some known or suspected amount of indoor air contaminants 
of these properties  one is believed to be affected by contamination caused by third party sources and houses underground storage tanks  one contains friable asbestos  contain non friable asbestos  nine house underground storage tanks  and three contain known or suspected indoor air contaminants 
the property affected by contamination is affected primarily by petroleum and solvent substances  and a third party has indemnified us for any and all problems associated with this contamination 
with regard to those properties affected by asbestos  asbestos does not pose a health hazard if it is not disturbed in such a way to cause an airborne release of asbestos 
asbestos is friable when it can be crumbled  pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure  and non friable when hand pressure cannot release encapsulated asbestos fibers 
friable asbestos is more likely to be released into the air than no friable asbestos 
we manage all asbestos in ways that minimize its potential to become airborne or otherwise threaten human health 
regarding underground storage tanks  subsurface leakage of the materials contained within the tank constitutes the primary risk posed by these devices 
we comply with all applicable laws  including double wall construction  testing protocols  placement of tanks within bermed areas  and the installation of leak and spill detection equipment  to minimize the risks posed by underground storage tanks 
the environmental site assessments and investigations have not  however  revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that our environmental site assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products  except as noted above 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties  other than as noted above 
it is possible that future laws will impose material environmental liabilities on us and that the current environmental condition of our properties will be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us
