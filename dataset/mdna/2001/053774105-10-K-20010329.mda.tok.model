a detailed discussion of revenue trends is included in reportable operating segments 
our expenses decreased billion  or  primarily due to a billion charge recorded during for the settlement of the principal common stockholder class action lawsuit and also the impact from businesses disposed of during during  we also recorded a non cash credit of million in connection with an adjustment to the number of rights to be issued under the settlement of the class action lawsuit that was brought on behalf of prides holders in  which was partially offset by a charge of million recorded in connection with litigation asserting claims associated with accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc and outside of the principal common stockholder class action lawsuit 
expenses were also impacted by an increase in restructuring and other unusual charges and a decrease in interest expense  as discussed below 
during  our management  with the appropriate level of authority  formally committed to various strategic initiatives  which were generally aimed at improving the overall level of organizational efficiency  consolidating and rationalizing existing processes and reducing cost structures in our underlying businesses 
accordingly  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  of which million impacted continuing operations 
these initiatives primarily affected our travel and insurance wholesale segments and are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of cash payments of approximately million  funded from operations  were made during we do not anticipate additional significant cash requirements other than those already made during the initiatives are anticipated to increase pre tax income by approximately million to million annually  commencing in the initial recognition of the charge and the corresponding utilization from inception is summarized by category as follows balance at restructuring cash other december  charge payments reductions personnel related asset impairments and contract terminations facility related total reclassification for discontinued operations total related to continuing operations personnel related costs primarily included severance resulting from the consolidation of business operations and certain corporate functions 
asset impairments and contract termination costs were incurred in connection with a change in our strategic focus to an online business model and primarily consisted of million associated with the exit of our timeshare software development business 
facility related costs consisted of facility closures and lease obligations also resulting from the consolidation of business operations 
during and  we also incurred unusual charges of million and million  respectively  primarily representing irrevocable contributions to an independent technology trust responsible for completing the transition of our lodging franchisees to a company sponsored property management system 
additionally  we incurred investigation related costs of million and million during and  respectively  which were primarily associated with professional fees and public relations costs incurred in connection with accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc and resulting investigations into such matters 
also during  we incurred million of charges primarily in connection with the termination of the proposed acquisition of rac motoring services 
our net interest expense decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a decrease in our average debt balance outstanding  partially offset by interest expense accrued on our stockholder litigation settlement liability during during and  we recorded a net loss of million and a net gain of million  respectively  in connection with the dispositions of certain non strategic businesses 
also during  we recorded a gain of million in connection with the recognition of a portion of our deferred gain on the sale of avis group due to the disposition of vms europe by avis group in our provision benefit for income taxes consisted of a tax provision of million in  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of million in  or an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate variance represents the impact of the disposition of our fleet segment in  which was accounted for as a tax free merger 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million 
reportable operating segments vs 
the underlying discussions of each segment s operating results focuses on adjusted ebitda  which is defined as earnings before non operating interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and minority interest  adjusted to exclude certain items  which are of a non recurring or unusual nature and are not measured in assessing segment performance or are not segment specific 
our management believes such discussions are the most informative representation of how management evaluates performance 
however  our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 
as of january   we refined our corporate overhead allocation method 
expenses that were previously allocated among segments based upon a percentage of revenue are now recorded by each specific segment if the expense is primarily associated with that segment 
we determined this refinement to be appropriate subsequent to the completion of our divestiture plan and based upon the composition of our business units in year ended december  adjusted revenues adjusted ebitda ebitda margin change a change travel b   real estate franchise insurance wholesale c relocation mortgage move

e adjusted ebitda for excludes charges of i  million associated with the settlement of the principal common stockholder class action lawsuit  ii million for investigation related costs  iii million related to the termination of a proposed acquisition and iv million principally related to the consolidation of european call centers in ireland 
such charges were partially offset by a net gain of million related to the dispositions of businesses 
travel revenues increased million while adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  however  the primary drivers impacting our franchise and timeshare business operations reflected growth year over year 
royalties from our franchise business increased million  or  principally due to a increase in available rooms within our lodging business and a increase in the volume of car rental transactions at avis group 
timeshare exchange revenues grew million  or  primarily due to a growth in memberships and a increase in the average exchange fee 
timeshare subscription revenues remained constant  despite the membership growth  due to the impact of the january  implementation of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which modified and extended the timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions and certain other fees 
accounting under sab no 
resulted in non cash reductions in timeshare subscription revenues and preferred alliance revenues of million and million  respectively 
also during  adjusted ebitda declined in part due to million of incremental overhead allocations from refined allocation methods  which was partially offset by an increase of million in revenues and adjusted ebitda due to incremental dividend income recognized on our preferred stock investment in avis group 
during  revenues and adjusted ebitda benefited by million from the execution of a bulk timeshare exchange transaction and also by million from the generation of a master license agreement and joint venture 
additionally during  revenues and adjusted ebitda included million of gains recognized on the sale of a portion of our common equity interest in avis group 
real estate franchise revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million  or  and million  or  respectively 
such increases primarily represent higher royalty fees of million  or  generated from our real estate franchise brands  which principally resulted from an increase in the average price of homes sold net of a reduction in the volume of homes sold 
industry statistics provided by the national association of realtors for the year ended december  indicated that the volume of existing home sales industry wide declined by and the average price of homes sold increased by 
based on these statistics  we out performed the industry wide growth in the dollar volume of homes sold 
increases in royalties and franchise fees are recognized with minimal corresponding increases in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
such increases were partially offset by a year over year reduction of million in gains recognized from the sale of portions of our preferred stock investments in nrt incorporated 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was further offset by an million increase in corporate overhead allocations due to refined allocation methods 
excluding the reduction of million in gains and the increase of million in corporate overhead allocations  revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million  or  and million  or  respectively 
we also continued to add new franchise brokerages to our franchise system in the gross commissions added by our core franchise sales exclusive of sales by nrt  our largest franchisee were higher 
revenue growth has been moderated by modestly declining volume and significantly reduced acquisition activity at nrt for the majority of the year 
however  in december  nrt acquired the largest independent real estate brokerage in california 
additionally  the pipeline of potential acquistions by nrt has grown significantly 
we believe that the combination of nrt acquisition opportunities and additional franchise sales should mitigate the currently anticipated industry wide decline in existing home sales 
insurance wholesale revenues and adjusted ebitda decreased million and million  respectively 
domestic revenues and adjusted ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  and the adjusted ebitda margin was  down from contributing to this decline were reduced billings and collections of insurance premiums

the majority of such costs were offset by economies and related cost savings realized from such consolidation 
international revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to a increase in international memberships 
the adjusted ebitda margin internationally increased to in we project that improved market conditions  increased volume of direct mail insurance solicitations and the continued cost saving benefits of the consolidation of domestic operations will improve operating results throughout relocation revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  reflecting a continuing trend in our business operations from asset based to service based 
higher service based fees include increases of i million of referral fees  reflecting increased penetration in both destination and departure markets  ii million of outsourcing fees resulting from expanded services  iii million of international revenues resulting from increased marketing and sales efforts and iv million of other ancillary service fees 
also contributing to the increase in revenues and adjusted ebitda was improved interest income of million resulting from maintaining lower debt levels principally due to operating benefits realized from our investment in technology

revenues from mortgage loans closed increased million due to favorable production margins  partially offset by a reduction in mortgage loan closings 
the average production fee increased basis points  or  due to a reduction in the direct costs per loan

the decline in loan closings was primarily the result of a billion reduction in mortgage refinancing volume 
this reduction was due to s unprecedented industry wide refinancing activity 
purchase mortgage closings in our retail lending business where we interact directly with the consumer increased billion to billion 
retail mortgage lending has been our primary focus and accounted for more than of loan volume in we ranked as the fifth largest retail mortgage lender by the national mortgage news registered trademark for during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an expanded agreement with merrill lynch  under which merrill lynch has outsourced its mortgage origination and servicing operations to us  beginning january  merrill lynch closed approximately billion in retail purchase mortgages during assuming merrill lynch s loan volume was part of our operating results for the full year of  we believe we would have ranked as the second largest retail mortgage lender in loan servicing revenues in included an million gain on the sale of servicing rights 
excluding such gain  recurring loan servicing revenue increased million  or 
the increase in loan servicing revenues was principally attributable to a corresponding increase in the average servicing portfolio  which grew approximately billion  or 
the adjusted ebitda margin decreased principally because of lower loan origination volume during the first half of as we anticipated  market conditions improved in the second half of  producing more positive margin comparisons 
we continue to expect improvement in our operating results during the first half of move 
com group revenues increased million  while adjusted ebitda decreased million to a loss of million 
the increase in revenues principally reflects a significant increase in sponsorship revenues made possible by the launch of the move

additionally  we integrated netmarket group  an online membership business  in the fourth quarter of  which contributed million to revenues but also decreased adjusted ebitda by million 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease in membership expirations during revenue is generally recognized upon expiration of the membership  which was partially mitigated by a reduction in operating and marketing expenses  including commissions  which directly related to servicing fewer members 
results of consolidated operations vs 
our revenues increased million  or  which reflected growth in a majority of our reportable operating segments despite the effects of dispositions of non strategic businesses

certain parties in the class action have appealed the district court s orders approving the plan of allocation of the settlement fund and awarding of attorneys fees and expenses to counsel for the lead plaintiffs 
none of the appeals challenged the fairness of the billion settlement amount 
the us court of appeals for the third circuit has issued a briefing schedule for the appeals which is nearly complete 
no date for oral argument has been set 
we intend to finance the billion settlement amount with cash generated from our operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities and new borrowings 
the settlement agreement required us to post collateral in the form of credit facilities and or surety bonds by november  we also had the option of forming a trust established for the benefit of the plaintiffs in lieu of posting collateral 
on november   we posted collateral in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds in the amounts of billion and million  respectively 
we also made a cash deposit of approximately million to the trust 
the credit facilities under which we posted the collateral also required us to make minimum deposits to this trust through as discussed under debt financing 
debt financing activities of our management and mortgage programs are autonomous and distinct from our other activities 
therefore  management believes it is more useful to review the debt financing of management and mortgage programs separately from the debt financing of our other activities 
exclusive of management and mortgage programs our total long term debt decreased approximately million to billion at december  such decrease was attributable to principal payments totaling million to reduce outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and also the redemption of million principal amount of senior notes 
at december   our long term debt was principally comprised of billion of senior notes maturing in december  million of convertible subordinated notes maturing in february and million outstanding under our term loan facility 
we have a billion three year competitive advance and revolving credit facility maturing in august and a million five year revolving credit facility maturing in october the three year facility contains the committed capacity to issue up to billion in letters of credit  of which billion was utilized as part of the collateral arrangements under the settlement agreement

in connection with the billion in letters of credit posted as collateral  we are required to make additional minimum deposits of million  million and million during  and  respectively  to a trust established for the benefit of the plaintiffs in our principal common stockholder class action lawsuit 
the escrow deposits will serve to reduce the amount of collateral previously posted by us  as required by the settlement agreement 
in february and march  we issued billion and million  respectively  aggregate principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes to qualified institutional buyers in a private offering for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
we used million of such proceeds to extinguish outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility 
the remaining proceeds are expected to be utilized to reduce other borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
the notes mature in and bear interest at 
we will not make periodic payments of interest on the notes  but may be required to make nominal cash payments in specified circumstances 
each  principal amount at maturity will be convertible  subject to satisfaction of specific contingencies  into shares of our cd common stock 
the notes will not be redeemable by us prior to february   but will be redeemable thereafter at the issue price of per note plus accrued discount through the redemption date 
in addition  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on february   or in such circumstance  we may pay the purchase price in cash  shares of our cd common stock  or any combination thereof 
in february  we entered into a million term loan agreement with terms similar to our other revolving credit facilities 
this term loan amortizes in three equal installments on august   may  and february  borrowings under this facility bear interest at libor plus a margin of basis points 
a portion of this term loan was used to finance the acquisition of avis group on march  our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  mergers  limitations on liens  liquidations and sale and leaseback transactions  and also require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   we had complied with all the restrictive covenants 
our long term debt credit ratings are bbb with standard poor s  baa with moody s and bbb with fitch ibca

related to management and mortgage programs our phh subsidiary operates our mortgage and relocation services businesses as a separate public reporting entity and supports the origination of mortgages and advances under relocation contracts primarily by issuing commercial paper and medium term notes and by maintaining secured obligations  depending upon asset growth and financial market conditions 
phh debt is issued without recourse to us 
phh debt is not classified based on contractual maturities  but rather is included in liabilities under management and mortgage programs since the debt corresponds directly with the high quality related assets 
phh expects to continue to maximize its access to global capital markets by maintaining the quality of its assets under management 
this is achieved by maintaining credit standards to minimize credit risk and the potential for losses 
phh s debt decreased approximately million to billion at december  such decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in medium term notes  partially offset by an increase in commercial paper 
at december   phh s outstanding debt was comprised of billion of commercial paper  million of secured obligations with a total commitment of million and renewable on an annual basis  million of medium term notes maturing through and million of unsecured borrowings maturing in during  phh filed a shelf registration statement registering an additional billion of debt securities  which increased the amount available for issuing medium term notes to approximately billion at december  phh issued million of medium term notes under this shelf registration in january  bearing interest at a rate of per annum and maturing in february the senior indenture under which the medium term notes were issued prevents phh from paying dividends and or making intercompany loans to us if  after giving effect to those dividends or intercompany loans  phh s debt to equity ratio exceeds to furthermore  under the senior indenture  phh s ratio of debt to tangible net worth must be maintained at or less than to a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to finance the acquisition of avis group on march  proceeds from future offerings will be used to finance assets under management and for general corporate purposes 
phh manages its exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk by matching floating and fixed interest rate and maturity characteristics of funding to related assets  varying short and long term domestic and international funding sources and securing available credit under committed banking facilities 
to provide additional financial flexibility  phh s current policy is to ensure that committed facilities aggregate percent of the average amount of outstanding commercial paper 
as of december   phh maintained billion of committed and unsecured revolving credit facilities 
these facilities comprise a million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in  a million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in and million of other revolving credit facilities maturing in borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a rate of libor  plus a margin of approximately basis points 
phh is required to pay a per annum facility fee of approximately 
under the facilities 
the full amount of these facilities was undrawn and available to support the average outstanding commercial paper balance at december  on february   phh renewed its million syndicated revolving credit facility  which was due in the new facility bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin  as defined in the agreement  and terminates on february  phh is required to pay a per annum utilization fee of 
if usage under the facility exceeds of aggregate commitments 
under the new facility  any loans outstanding as of february  may be converted into a term loan with a final maturity of february  the facilities contain certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  mergers  limitations on liens  liquidations and sale and leaseback transactions  and also require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   phh had complied with all the restrictive covenants 
phh s long term credit ratings are a with fitch ibca  a with standard poor s and baa with moody s 
phh s short term ratings are f with fitch ibca  a with standard poor s and p with moody s 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
in addition to the above mentioned sources of financing  phh will continue to manage outstanding debt with the potential sale or transfer of managed assets to third parties while retaining fee related servicing responsibility 
at december   phh maintained the following agreements whereby managed assets were sold or transferred to third parties bishops gate residential mortgage trust 
under this revolving sales agreement  an unaffiliated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  bishops gate  committed to purchase for cash  at phh s option  mortgage loans originated by phh on a daily basis  up to bishops gate s asset limit of billion  until may phh retains the servicing rights on the mortgage loans sold to bishops gate and arranges for the sale or securitization of the mortgage loans into the secondary market 
bishops gate retains the right to select alternative sale or securitization arrangements 
at december  and  phh was servicing approximately billion and million  respectively  of mortgage loans owned by bishops gate 
apple ridge funding 
under these revolving sales agreements  certain relocation receivables are transferred for cash  on a revolving basis  to an unaffiliated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  apple ridge  until march  phh retains a subordinated residual interest and the related servicing rights and obligations in the relocation receivables 
at december   phh was servicing approximately million of receivables under these agreements 
at december   phh had not transferred any assets to apple ridge 
we closely evaluate not only the credit of the banks providing phh s sources of financing  but also the terms of the various agreements to ensure on going availability 
we believe that our current policy provides adequate protection should volatility in the financial markets limit phh s access to commercial paper or medium term notes funding 
phh continuously seeks additional sources of liquidity to accommodate its asset growth and to provide further protection from volatility in the financial markets 
in the event that the public debt market is unable to meet phh s funding needs  we believe that phh has appropriate alternative sources to provide adequate liquidity  including current and potential future securitizations and its revolving credit facilities 
other liquidity during  we received million in cash in connection with the issuance of a mandatorily redeemable preferred interest  which is mandatorily redeemable years from the date of issuance and may be redeemed by us after years  or earlier in certain circumstances

see note mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities issued by a subsidiary holding solely senior debentures issued by the company for a detailed discussion regarding the issuances of prides and the related settlement provisions 
under our common share repurchase program  we have approximately million remaining availability 
we do not anticipate utilizing any of this availability during strategic business initiatives on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of avis group that were not currently owned by us at a price of per share in cash  or approximately million  including million of transaction costs and expenses 
on november   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of fairfield communities  one of the largest vacation ownership companies in the united states  at per share  or approximately million in the aggregate 
the final acquisition price may increase to a maximum of per share depending upon a formula based on the average trading price of cd common stock over a day trading period prior to the date on which fairfield stockholders meet to approve the transaction 
the consideration is payable in cash or cd common stock  or a combination thereof  at the holder s election 
we are not required  however  to pay more than of the consideration in cash and have the right to substitute cash for any shares of fairfield common stock instead of issuing cd common stock

the purchase price for the possible acquisitions may be paid in cash  through the issuance of cd common stock or other of our securities  borrowings  or a combination thereof 
prior to consummating any such possible acquisition  we will need to  among other things  initiate and complete satisfactorily our due diligence investigations  negotiate the financial and other terms including price and conditions of such acquisitions  obtain appropriate board of directors  regulatory and other necessary consents and approvals  and  if necessary  secure financing 
no assurance can be given with respect to the timing  likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction

recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force released issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets 
eitf issue no 
modifies the accounting for interest income and impairment of beneficial interests in securitization transactions for quarters beginning after march   whereby beneficial interests determined to have an other than temporary impairment are required to be written down to fair value 
we plan to adopt eitf issue no

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated in a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated in a cash flow hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas no 
defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  the changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
as of january   we will record a million million  after tax non cash charge as a cumulative transition adjustment to earnings relating to derivatives not designated as hedges prior to adopting sfas no 
and to derivatives designated in fair value type hedges 
the outcome of pending issues at the fasb and the derivatives implementation group could impact the amount of the cumulative transition adjustment presented herein 
the cumulative effect is based on management s interpretation of the accounting literature as of march as provided for in sfas no

you should consider the areas of risk described above in connection with any forward looking statements that may be made by us 
except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements  to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly interest rate swaps  forward delivery commitments and futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities  debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign currency denominated translational and transactional exposures 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making  or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
our derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges of underlying exposures  as those instruments demonstrate high correlation in relation to the asset or transaction being hedged 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage prepayments  mortgage loans held for sale  and anticipated mortgage production arising from commitments issued and also libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that such interest rates will remain a primary market exposure for the foreseeable future 
our primary foreign currency rate exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations in the british pound sterling 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a primary market exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair value of relocation receivables  equity advances on homes  mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment speeds and discount rates 
in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities  the models also utilize credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgage loans and commitments to fund mortgages forward delivery contracts and options  we use an option adjusted spread oas model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
we also utilize the oas model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumption in an oas model is the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions used in determining fair value 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december  our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis permitted  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  and market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
