item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change of principal business emphasis in november  the company began participating in the commercial real estate lending business as a direct lender through bridge financial corporation bfc or bridge  a wholly owned subsidiary 
during the past three years we have continued to reposition our historical static assets from real estate development and sales into commercial real estate lending 
we have entered the final phase of our plan to dispose of our real estate and mineral assets 
the company currently maintains and plans to continue to maintain a small high quality industrial building portfolio located in the phoenix metropolitan area 
at december  the major portions of unsold real estate were over  acres of our rural lands in northeastern arizona  the seven canyons project  and urban and suburban land in new mexico 
the company continually reviews the best available use of the cash raised from sales of real estate and mineral assets 
evaluation of the strategic alternatives available to the company may result in investment in lines of business in which the company is not currently engaged 
the company is not a party to any binding agreements representing the acquisition of  or investment in  new businesses or lines of business 
we believe that the sale of these assets  for which the realization of value may otherwise be years in the future  and the subsequent acquisition of other assets or enterprises which earn a current return  will be in the best interests of the shareholders 
the strategic alternatives available to the company if it is holding a substantial amount of its net worth in cash should be significant  perhaps allowing the company to participate in sectors that have demonstrated more growth potential than real estate lending 
results of operations the following table summarizes the company s consolidated revenues and earnings for the indicated periods years ended december in thousands  except share data revenue    net income    earnings per share of common stock basic

operating income from property rentals increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily attributable to increases in two items  partially offset by decreases in two items 
we owned five industrial buildings at higher occupancy rates for the entire year of compared to three industrial buildings owned for part of the year in with lower occupancy rates 
these increases were partially offset by an operating loss of approximately  from real estate owned and operating revenue included in from apartments in new mexico before they were sold that year 
revenues from commercial real estate lending increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues as a result of a increase in the loan portfolio in than in the loan portfolio held by the company and recorded in the financial statements increased  even though the size of the managed portfolio decreased 
the decrease in the managed portfolio is primarily due to two items 
in  the company completed a foreclosure on a hotel property  and the company acquired certain land located in arizona from a borrower 
the acquisition was paid for by the extinguishment of indebtedness and cash 
on each loan  the company had a participant 
the participant is now a co owner of the properties with the company  in the same proportion as in the loan participations 
the company s portion of the assets continues to be recorded in investments in joint ventures as it was prior to the acquisitions  but is not included in the managed portfolio 
general and administrative expense decreased  or from  in to  in the decrease is primarily due to decreases in three items

while rental properties provide relatively stable operating results from period to period  our revenues are affected by the nature and timing of sales of property and non strategic assets 
sales of assets are difficult to predict and are generally subject to negotiations and contingencies 
these factors tend to bunch income in particular periods rather than producing a more even pattern throughout the year 
gross margins may vary significantly due to the cost basis of the properties sold in any particular period 
income before income taxes decreased from  in to  in the decrease is primarily attributable to the volume and mix of real estate sales and a decrease in legal costs primarily associated with the settlement of the sedona project litigation in the fourth quarter of these two decreases are partially offset by an increase in interest expense

short term commercial real estate lending segment revenues increased from  in to  in approximately of the increase is due to an increase in lending revenues and approximately is an increase in revenue from real estate owned 
the lending increase is primarily the result of a growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the real estate owned increase is due to two factors 
real estate owned includes residential lots in new mexico and a hotel located in phoenix  arizona 
the residential lots were acquired in from one of our borrowers 
the lots are being sold back to the borrower under a rolling option agreement

approximately  of the increase is due to increased legal fees  primarily attributable to the sedona project litigation and fees associated with the sale of real estate 
approximately  of the increase is due to increased accounting costs  primarily attributable to professional fees related to the company s restatement of its quarterly financial statements and additional audit and tax consulting surrounding the company s sale of several real estate assets 
a portion of the increased accounting costs is due to tax consulting related to improving the company s tax analysis models and systems 
the decrease of approximately  is due to a non recurring excise tax incurred in  but not in  in connection with the termination of the company s defined benefit plan 
included in general administrative expense for and  respectively  is  and  for legal and other professional fees related to the sedona project litigation 
the litigation was settled in november nz corporation page real estate segment income before income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily attributable to the volume and mix of real estate sales partially offset by a decline in operating income from property rentals 
the modest decline in identifiable assets from  in to  in is due to a net increase in assets from the sale of the four apartment complexes in new mexico and the subsequent exchange for industrial buildings in the metropolitan phoenix area  offset by a decrease in assets from the disposition of real estate 
short term commercial real estate lending segment revenues increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues as a result of a larger portfolio in than in additionally  the revenues include approximately  from property sales and operations from real estate owned as a result of foreclosure and repossession of collateral on delinquent loans

liquidity and capital resources the real estate lending business requires large amounts of capital to be an effective competitor in the market 
in addition  the company requires cash for working capital 
we expect to generate cash from the sale of our remaining real estate assets 
cash will also be generated from principal repayments on maturing loans in the company s existing loan portfolio and collections from property rentals 
in addition  the company now uses and intends to continue to use participants or other joint funding sources on certain real estate loans 
further  the company has lines of credit with non bank commercial lenders and a commercial bank from which it can fund loans 
in  operating activities provided  of net cash flows 
operating cash inflows were primarily generated from property sales and cash received from leases 
operating cash flows outflows were primarily used to pay interest  income taxes and other operating activities 
in  investing activities used  of net cash flows 
investing cash inflows were primarily generated from the collections of principal on commercial real estate loans 
investing cash outflows were primarily used for additions to commercial real estate loans and contributions to joint ventures 
the contributions to joint ventures are primarily commercial real estate loans accounted for as a joint venture 
in  financing activities provided  of net cash flows 
financing cash inflows were primarily generated from additional borrowings 
financing cash outflows were primarily used to partially repay outstanding borrowings and repurchase treasury stock 
the company intends to negotiate additional or modified lines of credit  as business circumstances require 
the company s goal in these negotiations will be to improve the effectiveness and cost of available capital and to obtain lines of credit of a size appropriate for the company s expected needs 
a principal outcome of the company s discussions with potential lenders will be to determine how rapidly the company will be able to grow its commercial real estate lending business 
the terms of any new or changed financing arrangement will likely have a material effect upon the company s margins in its lending business and on the size of the managed loan portfolio 
if the company is not successful in negotiating such financing  the principal effect will be slower growth in the company s lending business  with the pace of growth in the near term being determined at least in significant part by the timing of the company s sales of existing real estate assets 
the company currently has a  partially secured line of credit from a commercial bank  of which  is a revolving line for general corporate purposes  and  of which is a back up facility for a letter of assurance the bank has provided to yavapai county  arizona  in connection with development costs for the seven canyons project 
the line bears interest at the prime rate as of december  and expires july  at december  there was an outstanding balance of  as of february  the line had an outstanding balance of  this loan contains financial covenants which require the company to maintain a specified minimum ratio of net notes receivable as defined to the outstanding loan balance  a nz corporation page specified maximum ratio of debt to net worth  and a specified minimum tangible net worth

as amounts are drawn  the line will be secured by certain loan assets of the company 
the line bears interest at day libor plus basis points and expires october  at december  and february  there was no outstanding balance 
this loan contains financial covenants that require bfc to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
as of december   bfc was in compliance with these financial covenants 
the line of credit is guaranteed by the company 
in addition to bank lines  the company may seek qualified joint venture partners to finance large real estate development projects or loans to the extent that the company actually engages in such projects or loans in the future 
the use of joint venture partners provides a source of capital  reduces the company s risk by sharing it with another party  and gives the company access to expertise that it might not otherwise have for particular projects 
inflation  deflation  and changing prices the results of operations may be affected by inflation  deflation  and changing prices 
price changes and market trends in real estate  rental rates  interest rates  oil  gas  and uranium could have significant effects on the company s operations 
while the company does not believe such items have had a material effect on operations and knows of no conditions which would cause the company to believe that such items could have a material effect on results  changes in prevailing interest rates and real estate values could have a significant effect on bfc s real estate lending business 
new accounting standards as of january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no

sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
currently  we do not use derivative instruments nor did we identify any imbedded derivatives in other contracts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 there was no material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition this report contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  and expectations of our future economic performance  taking into account the information currently available to management 
these statements are not statements of historical fact 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results  performance  or financial condition to differ materially from the expectations we express or imply in any forward looking statement 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to those set forth below 
real estate market 
the company will continue to be linked to the real estate market  particularly the markets in california and the southwestern united states 
a downturn in any of those markets could adversely affect the company s performance 
the company expects to generate significant amounts of cash through the sale of several real estate assets 
while the real estate markets are generally healthy in the areas where the company currently owns real estate  there is no assurance that the markets will continue to be favorable over the disposition period of these assets 
the market for some of our rural land located in northeastern arizona is limited  particularly for the portion of land that may not be suitable for inclusion in our recreational lot sales program 
a downturn in nz corporation page the real estate market could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to sell its real estate assets at a profit or at all  and have an adverse impact on the company s ability to attract joint venture funding for any future development or lending projects 
if that were to happen  the company s growth  particularly the growth of bfc  could be restrained due to a lack of capital 
in addition  a downturn in the real estate market could affect the company s real estate lending business 
if bfc finds it necessary to foreclose on properties after a default by a borrower  it is possible that the company would not  particularly in the short term  be able to recover its entire investment in the loan 
also  in the past  downturns in the real estate market have resulted in a higher rate of foreclosures generally 
interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates can have a variety of effects on the company s commercial real estate lending business 
in particular  changes in interest rates affect the volume of loan originations and acquisitions 
the company does not hold any loans for sale  except for the syndications described below 
during periods of declining interest rates  the company typically experiences an increase in demand for loan originations because of increased commercial real estate development activity 
the company intends generally to hold loans that it funds in its loan portfolio  although it may occasionally sell a loan or syndicate its loans to pension funds and other institutional investors 
the company s net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on loans held in its portfolio generally based on long term interest rates and the interest it pays on its borrowings generally based on short term interest rates 
to the extent short term interest rates are lower than long term interest rates  the company generally earns net interest income from the difference  or the spread  during the time the mortgage loans are held by the company 
to the extent this spread narrows  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s net interest income will be affected by borrowing costs other than interest expense associated with its borrowings 
delinquency  foreclosure and other credit risks 
liabilities under representations and warranties 
economic downturns can have a negative impact on a real estate lender s profitability as the frequency of loan defaults tends to increase 
from the time that the company funds the loans it originates  to the time the loan is repaid or is earlier sold by the company  the company is generally at risk for any loan defaults 
if the company sells the loans it originates or sells participations in such loans  the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures passes to the purchaser of the loans 
however  in the ordinary course of business  the company makes certain representations and warranties to the purchasers of loans and to loan participants 
these representations and warranties generally relate to the origination and servicing of loans 
if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of these representations or warranties  the company may become liable for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan 
in such a case  the company may be required to repurchase the loan or the loan participation and bear any subsequent loss on the loan 
loan participations 
bridge financial corporation sometimes retains only a portion of originated loans in its own portfolio and works with a participating lender to place the other portion of the loans in the portfolio of the participating lender 
most of the participations have been with pension funds who manage significantly larger funds than bfc 
the participants typically receive the same interest income and points as does bfc 
bfc normally receives an origination fee and a servicing fee on the participant s portion of the loan 
by participating loans bfc is generally able to originate larger loans than it could originate without participants  but the company typically assumes a subordinate position with respect to repayment of principal in relation to the position of the loan participant 
loan participants and prospective loan participants may change their criteria for participating in loans  they may choose to not participate at all and they may decide to compete with the company in certain markets 
to the extent that loan participants and prospective loan participants change the way in which they have participated in loans  the company may be unable to originate the size of loans it now plans and growth may be slowed 
availability of funding sources 
the company will require substantial capital resources to grow its commercial real estate lending business 
the amount and terms of financing available to the company will have a material effect upon how rapidly and to what level the company will be able to increase its lending activities 
while the company expects to be able to obtain financing as its lending arrangements mature  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
to the extent that the company is not successful in arranging financing  it may have to curtail its loan origination activities 
concentration of business 
the company continues to geographically diversify its loan portfolio  however  a significant portion of the company s commercial lending business is conducted in arizona 
at december   approximately of the nz corporation page company s managed loan portfolio was secured by properties located in arizona 
given the concentration of the company s business in arizona  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations would not be adversely affected to the extent arizona experiences a period of slow or negative economic growth which results in decreased commercial loan originations and or an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults 
competition 
the commercial real estate lending business is highly competitive 
the company competes with other non bank lenders  commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions in every aspect of its lending business  including funding loans and acquiring origination capabilities 
the company competes with financial institutions that have substantially greater financial resources  greater operating efficiencies and longer operating histories than the company 
to the extent that market pricing becomes more aggressive  the company may be unable to achieve its planned level of originations 
ability to enter new markets 
the ability of the company to grow the lending business depends to a significant degree upon management s ability to originate loans in new markets in california and the southwestern united states 
this type of market expansion will require  among other tasks  hiring capable and experienced people  marketing to new markets  additional underwriting procedures for new markets  determining whether to open new offices or service the loans from the central phoenix office  and holding down overhead to keep the new markets cost effective 
failure to adequately perform any or all of these tasks effectively could significantly impair the company s ability to expand into new markets  and could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
control of costs 
cost control is always an important element in achieving profitable operations and is especially important during significant expansions of operations 
management believes that a major factor that will allow the company to effectively compete with other lending institutions in the southwestern united states is its ability to originate loans at lower overall costs than many of its competitors 
the principal cost categories that must be closely managed are capital cost and overhead cost 
the ability of management to control these costs is critical to achieving profitability as it expands into new markets 
dependence on key individual 
r 
randy stolworthy has been the chief architect of the company s transition from a real estate business to a lending business 
the company has no employment agreement with mr 
stolworthy 
if the company were to lose mr 
stolworthy s services for any reason  significant time and money would be expended to try to identify  recruit and employ replacement personnel to continue the transition  with no guarantees that such a person could be found
