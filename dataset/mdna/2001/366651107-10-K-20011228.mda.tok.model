business measures research encompasses products which  on an ongoing basis  highlight industry developments  review new products and technologies  provide quantitative market research  analyze industry trends within a particular technology or market sector and provide comparative analysis of the it operations of organizations 
the company typically enters into annually renewable subscription contracts for research products 
revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term 
consulting revenues  primarily derived from consulting and measurement engagements and strategic advisory services are recognized as work is performed on a contract by contract basis 
events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition 
other revenues includes software licensing fees which are recognized when a signed non cancellable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the company s fees are fixed or determinable 
revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement  typically twelve months 
the company believes the following business measurements are important indicators of future revenues for its significant business segments 
revenue category business measurements research contract value attributable to all subscription research products with ratable revenue recognition 
contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the duration of the contracts 
consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in process consulting  measurement and strategic advisory services engagements 
events deferred events revenue directly relates to symposia  conferences and exhibitions 
contract value is a significant measure of the company s volume of business 
the company s past experience has been that a substantial portion of client companies renew subscription products for an equal or higher level each year 
in addition  the company has been able to increase its multi year contracts to of total contract value at september  from at september  total research contract value decreased to approximately million at september  from million at september  the decrease was due primarily to less favorable economic conditions which have led to constrained it spending  the september th terrorist attacks  which occurred three weeks before the company s fiscal year end and the impact of foreign currency adjustments 
after adjusting for foreign exchange  research contract value was down 
total research deferred revenues of million and million at september  and  respectively  represent unamortized revenues from billed products and services 
deferred revenues do not directly correlate to contract value as of the same date since contract value represents an annualized value of all outstanding contracts without regard to the duration of such contracts  and deferred revenue represents unamortized revenue remaining on all outstanding and billed contracts 
all research contracts are billable upon signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
all research contracts are non cancelable and non refundable  except for government contracts which have a day cancellation clause  but have not produced material cancellations to date 
with the exception of certain government contracts which permit termination  it is the company s policy to record at the time of signing of a contract the entire amount of the contract billable as a fee receivable  which represents a legally enforceable claim  and a corresponding amount as deferred revenue 
for government contracts which permit termination  the company bills the client the full amount billable under the contract but only records a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract 
in addition  the company only records deferred revenue on these contracts when cash is received 
deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were million and million at september  and  respectively 
in addition  at september   the company has billed but not yet collected million of government contracts which permit termination 
accordingly  the company has not recorded the receivable and associated deferred revenue for these contracts 
the company records the commission obligation related to research contracts upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the related revenues are earned 
consulting backlog increased to approximately million at september  from million at september  the increase in backlog reflects primarily the growth in the strategic advisory services engagements 
deferred revenue from events decreased to approximately million at september  from million at september  the decrease was due primarily to less favorable economic conditions and the september th attacks  including the related impacts on clients willingness to travel 
historically  research revenues typically increase in the first quarter of the fiscal year over the immediately preceding quarter primarily due to the increase in contract value at the end of the prior fiscal year 
events revenues have increased similarly due to annual conferences and exhibition events held in the first quarter 
additionally  operating income margin operating income as a percentage of total revenues typically improves in the first quarter of the fiscal year over the immediately preceding quarter due to the increase in research revenue upon which the company is able to further leverage its selling  general and administrative expenses  plus operating income generated from the first quarter symposium and itxpo exhibition events 
although operating income margins have generally not been as high in the remaining quarters  the full year impact of acquisitions and strategic initiatives may result in operating margin trends in the future that are not comparable to historical trends

factors that may affect future results the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the company and its clients are affected by the condition of the general economy 
the following section discusses many  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties 
general economic conditions 
the company s revenues and results of operations are influenced by general economic conditions 
a general economic downturn or a recession  anywhere in the world  could negatively effect demand for the company s products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology related budgets 
such economic downturn may materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations including the ability to achieve continued customer renewals and achieve new contract value  backlog and deferred events revenue 
the recent less favorable economic conditions and the september th terrorist attacks  which occurred three weeks before fiscal year end  have led to constrained it spending and some unwillingness on the part of clients to travel  thereby impacting the events business 
competitive environment 
the company faces competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services  as well as the internal marketing and planning organizations of the company s clients 
the company also competes indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers  including electronic and print media companies 
these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with the company in the future 
in addition  limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which the company competes 
as a result  additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services 
although the company s market share has been increasing  increased competition may result in loss of market share  diminished value in the company s products and services  reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures 
the company may not be successful if it cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis  timely delivery of information  customer service  the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis  and price

technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 
international operations

if any of these arrangements are terminated  the company may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with the company or its new agent 
branding 
the company believes that its gartner brand is critical to the company s efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases 
the company expects to expand its marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase its marketing budget  hire additional marketing and public relations personnel  expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain brand loyalty among clients

as a result  the company s financial results could be materially impacted 
indebtedness 
the company has incurred significant indebtedness 
the associated debt service could impair future operating results 
further  the outstanding debt could limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to the company  which in turn  could restrain the company s ability to expand or enhance products and services  respond to competitive pressures or pursue business opportunities that may arise in the future and involve substantial investments of additional capital

enforcement of the company s intellectual rights

despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the company s intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for the company

in addition  the company has certain limits in purchasing its common stock under the terms of the recapitalization

recently issued accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas were issued 
fas requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  fas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the company does not anticipate that adoption of fas will have any material effect on the company 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in connection with the fas transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the company is required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for companies with fiscal years beginning after march  the company expects to adopt fas in the first quarter ended december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting fas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact on the company s financial statements  specifically whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowing under long term debt which consists of a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and million of convertible subordinated notes see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at september   there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility the interest rate on borrowings is based on libor plus an additional to basis points based on the company s debt to ebitda ratio 
the company believes that an increase or decrease of in the effective interest rate on available borrowings from its senior revolving credit facility  if fully utilized  will not have a material effect on future results of operations 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the convertible subordinated notes  the conversion price as of september  was per share 
the number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes as of september  was million shares with a total market value of million  using the company s september  market price 
commencing on april   the note holder can convert the notes into shares of class a common stock 
although the company has the right to redeem the notes in certain circumstances  including after a conversion election  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient capital on a commercially reasonable basis  or at all  to fund a redemption 
beginning in  the company entered into a series of forward purchase agreements that extended through may to offset the dilutive effect of the company s stock based employee compensation plans 
these agreements were settled quarterly on a net basis in either shares of the company s class a common stock or cash  at the company s option 
during the year ended september   two settlements resulted in the company s issuance of  shares of class a common stock and paying approximately  in cash 
during the quarter ended june   the company reacquired  shares of class a common stock for approximately million through an early termination of the forward purchase agreements 
as of september   the company has no remaining commitments under these forward purchase agreements 
the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its equity investments 
the company invests in equity securities of public companies directly and through si i and si ii 
the company owns of si ii 
si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   the company had equity investments totaling million  including available for sale marketable securities with a fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
the gross unrealized losses of million have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the gross unrealized gains were insignificant 
these investments are inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop 
furthermore  certain of these investments are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market price volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in the company incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of its investments 
the company does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on its investments in equity securities and may incur additional losses related to these investments 
if there were a adverse change in the value of the company s equity portfolio as of september   this would result in a non cash impairment charge of million 
the company faces two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in the company s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar 
since the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is generally the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the company s consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations 
the company has generally not entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
at september   the company had only one outstanding foreign currency forward contract outstanding 
the contract requires the company to sell us dollars and purchase japanese yen 
the contract amount is million  and is for a one year term expiring on september   and contains a forward exchange rate of japanese yen 
the foreign currency forward contract was entered into to offset the foreign exchange effects of the company s japanese yen intercompany payable  which had a value at september  of million 
the forward contract and the intercompany payable are each reflected at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in earnings
