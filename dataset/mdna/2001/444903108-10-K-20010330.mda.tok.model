item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading genomics and biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutic product development and functional analysis of genes using our proprietary technology platform 
we discover  research  develop and intend to commercialize novel compounds for treating and diagnosing human disease based on the identification and study of genes 
we focus our internal product development efforts on therapeutic proteins  antibodies  peptides and fusion proteins and we use collaborations for the development of gene therapy products and small molecule drugs 
we have discovered a large number of genes through our genomics capabilities and have developed a rapidly evolving product pipeline based on our discoveries 
three therapeutic proteins we discovered  mirostipen mpif  repifermin kgf and blys  and one gene therapy product we discovered  vegf  have entered human clinical trials 
we also recently announced the initiation of a phase i human clinical trial with albuferontm  a new albumin alpha interferon fusion protein 
we have a number of additional products in preclinical development 
as part of our collaboration with glaxosmithkline gsk  gsk discovered an enzyme that lowers levels of lipoprotein associated phospholipase a lp pla and is being tested in ongoing human trials 
we have extensive capabilities in gene discovery  intellectual property protection and preclinical and clinical development and have recently established a manufacturing capability for the preparation of our proteins for human studies 
we intend to add sales and marketing and additional manufacturing capabilities as needed 
we have established strategic partnerships with a number of leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage our capabilities and gain access to complementary technologies and sales and marketing infrastructure 
some of these partnerships provide us with research funding and milestone payments  along with royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
we are also entitled to certain co promotion  co development  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and do not anticipate revenues from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years 
through december   we have received million in revenue and million in equity payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements with smithkline beecham now part of glaxosmithkline  payments of million from additional collaboration partners and an aggregate of million from other collaborators  including million from transgene sa  million from pioneer hi bred international  inc  million from pharmacia upjohn company  million from schering plough in addition to certain payments received from schering plough pursuant to our additional collaboration partner agreements  million from f 
hoffmann la roche  million from oravax merieux co 
and merieux oravax snc  and million from medimmune 
pursuant to the terms of such collaboration agreements  we expect to receive license fees and research payments of million in the aggregate over the next year 
see business collaborative arrangements 
to date we have received substantially all our revenue from payments made under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and  to a lesser extent  other agreements 
the glaxosmithkline collaboration agreement and many of our other collaboration agreements will expire in we expect that these collaboration agreements will not be renewed 
we also may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we expect that our revenue sources for at least the next several years may be limited to interest income  payments under various collaboration agreements  payments from the sale of rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and increasing losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
earnings per share have been restated to reflect two two for one stock splits paid in the form of a stock dividend on january  and october  results of operations years ended december  and revenues

expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   excluding the million charge for purchased in process research and development 
the increase resulted primarily from a continued increase in preclinical and clinical research and a full year of operations for our leased process development and manufacturing facility in  compared to  when the facility commenced operations in the second quarter of we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
purchased in process research and development expense of million for the year ended december  relates to the acquisition of principia pharmaceutical corporation on september  this amount represents that portion of the million purchase price allocated to in process research and development 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
patent expenses will continue to increase as additional applications are filed and existing applications are prosecuted in the united states and internationally 
interest income was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances 
our average cash balance increased during as a result of the placement of two convertible subordinated note offerings during  totaling million and a public offering of common stock which raised net proceeds of million 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  due primarily to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes during the first quarter of fiscal partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with previously issued convertible subordinated notes that were converted to equity during the first quarter of fiscal debt conversion expenses of million for the year ended december  relate to the first quarter of fiscal conversion costs of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes into equity 
we converted million of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  substantially all of which was paid in the form of common stock 
in addition  we converted all of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  all of which was paid in cash

as a result of the implementation of sab  the company has recorded a charge of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  retroactive to january  see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the difference in results for the years ended december  and is primarily due to the million  or per share  charge for purchased in process research and development  the million  or per share  of debt conversion expenses  the million  or per share  charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  higher operating expenses  and reduced collaboration partner revenues  offset by higher net interest income 
excluding the impact of the charge for purchased in process research and development  debt conversion expenses  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  our net loss would have been million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenue consisted of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck  the recognition of million from the collaborations with transgene  sa and pharmacia  and million in other revenue 
the revenue consisted of million in annual license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo and merck  million in license fees and research payments from a collaboration with pioneer  the recognition of million from the collaboration with transgene sa  million in license fees from a collaboration with pharmacia  and million in other revenue 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the start of operations for our leased process development and manufacturing facility in  along with a continued increase in preclinical and clinical research 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
interest income was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances 
our average cash balance has increased during as a result of the placement of two convertible subordinated note offerings during  totaling million 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to these two convertible subordinated notes 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the difference in results for the years ended december  and is primarily due to higher operating expenses  reduced collaboration partner revenues  and lower net interest income 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of billion at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in working capital is due to the issuance of million shares of common stock which raised net proceeds of million and also due to the private placement of million in convertible subordinated notes during  partially offset by the net loss generated during the year 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
at december   we had outstanding commitments for construction and equipment purchases totaling approximately million 
we expect that our existing funds  interest income  and committed license fees and research payments from our existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next several years 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs including our preclinical and clinical product development activities  the magnitude of those programs  the ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire  if unused  by the year we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our funds are currently invested in us treasury and government agency obligations and high grade corporate debt securities and commercial paper 
these investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with the emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of low risk us treasury securities and corporate debt having a rating of at least a p the short term nature of these securities  which have an average term of approximately one year  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the net fair value of our short term investments by approximately million  or less than of the aggregate fair value of billion  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are almost always held until maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our corporate debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our us securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates would adversely affect the interest income from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
during september  a privately held company in which we held an equity investment  ciphergen biosystems  inc successfully completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
because ciphergen is now a publicly traded company  we now carry our investment at market value 
as of december   the carrying values of our equity investments in transgene  cambridge antibody technology cat and ciphergen were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our investments in transgene and ciphergen are subject to equity market risk 
our investment in cat is denominated in pounds sterling and is subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk
