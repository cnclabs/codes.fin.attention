the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
overview finet is a financial services holding company 
finet  through it s wholly owned subsidiary monument mortgage  provides both traditional and on line mortgage services to brokers and consumers 
business to business services are provided to brokers and marketed through both traditional means and through its strategic partners 
consumer direct services are marketed through both the internet and various traditional advertising mediums 
monument mortgage is licensed to originate and fund mortgage loans in fifty states and the district of columbia 
finet currently derives all revenues through monument mortgage s activities  which include o the sale of mortgage loans that monument mortgage funds  consisting of the net gain on the sale of loans and servicing rights recognized as the difference between the selling price of the loan and servicing rights  and the carrying value of the loan and servicing rights sold  o fees charged for underwriting and processing loans  consisting of application  documentation  and processing fees paid by the borrower  o interest income generated from loans held for sale by monument mortgage  and o fees charged from monument mortgage s consumer direct brokerage activities  recognized at the time the lender funds the loan  and consisting of the margin added to the lender s loan price 
finet s costs and expenses consist of both fixed and variable expenses and are made up largely of o interest paid by monument mortgage for warehouse credit facilities  o monument mortgage s loan related expenses  consisting of fees paid to third parties for appraisal and credit report services  and reserves for potential loan repurchase and premium recapture obligations  o salaries  commissions and benefits paid to employees of both finet and monument mortgage  o general and administrative expenses such as occupancy costs  office expenses and professional services for both finet and monument mortgage  and o depreciation and amortization expense related principally to finet s facilities  furniture  fixtures  and equipment  as well as goodwill associated with finet s acquisition of lowestrate 
com  inc the mortgage industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations primarily due to a reduced level of home buying activity during the winter months 
loan originations generally increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continue through october 
as a result  finet may report earnings in these calendar quarters that are generally lower than that of the second and third calendar quarters 
in the future  finet s expenses are also likely to vary quarter to quarter based upon these fluctuations in the volume of loans monument mortgage originates 
economic and interest rate cycles also affect the mortgage industry  as loan originations typically fall in rising interest rate environments 
during such periods  refinancing originations decrease as higher interest rates provide reduced economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgages 
on april   finet acquired coastal in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
finet s results of operations and financial position for the fiscal year ended april  have been restated to include coastal s results 
coastal s results for years prior to fiscal have not been included in our consolidated results  as they are not meaningful in assessing historical trends 
on may   finet acquired mical in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
mical s results of operations are included in finet s financial statements since the date of acquisition 
due to significant operating problems and losses at coastal and mical  finet s management elected during fiscal to close both units and discontinue further operations 
impact of our discontinued units mical  coastal and our servicing business in the year finet continued executing the closure of the discontinued mical and coastal units that management elected to discontinue in the last half of fiscal finet incurred significant losses at both mical and coastal subsidiaries during fiscal management also determined that servicing loans would not be a part of the on going operations of monument mortgage and sold the servicing portfolios that had been previously held for sale 
the following table summarizes the impact these discontinued business units had on finet s consolidated operating results for the last three years eight months years ended ended fiscal years ended december december april unaudited revenues   cost of revenues     gross profit loss     other expenses general and administrative      marketing and advertising special charges   depreciation and amortization other total expenses      income loss from operations     other interest expense income loss before income taxes     income tax expense net income loss     results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  at the end of fiscal year april   finet s management decided to change from a fiscal reporting year to a calendar reporting year  thus resulting an eight month reporting year ending december  certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  revenues and originations total loan origination for finet s production units excluding brokered loans is summarized below 
for twelve months ended december variance variance in thousands unaudited business to business    business to consumer    total loan volume    comparative results of operations the following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended december  and and these results expressed as the percentage variance from fiscal year ended to fiscal year ended in thousands 
twelve months ended december variance variance unaudited revenues   cost of revenues    gross margin    operating expenses general and administrative    marketing and advertising    special charges    depreciation and amortization   other   total expenses    loss from operations    other income and expense gain on sale of marketable equity securities other interest income other interest expense loss before income taxes    income tax expense net loss    in substance preferred dividend net loss available to common stockholders    revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the years ended december   to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the impact of the discontinued units revenue in that did not occur in  and secondarily due to the effect of the sale of the servicing portfolio 
servicing revenue gradually decreased during until the entire portfolio was sold  therefore  no servicing income was received during revenues from brokerage fees were also negatively effected due to management s primary focus on developing the business to business unit 
finet believes that revenues will increase through monument mortgage s a planned expansion of higher margin products offered by monument mortgage b lead generation of lower margin products through strategic relationships 
however  there can be no assurances that increased revenues will be achieved 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  compensation costs of production related personnel  one of the primary components of cost of revenues and other origination related costs decreased  or million  from million to million 
gross margin improved million  or to million from million mainly due to a significant decrease in the loan loss allowance 
during  the entire servicing portfolio was sold  thus  additional expenses related to the sale were not incurred during the year ended december  these positive results were slightly offset by the increase in warehouse interest expense that resulted from increased production financed mainly through warehouse lending facilities during the year ended december  operating expenses general and administrative 
personnel costs and other general and administrative costs decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the closure of discontinued business units  resulting in a substantially decreased employee headcount within these units 
marketing and advertising 
marketing expenses decreased million or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  during the year ended december  finet s primary focus was retail operations 
therefore  monument mortgage initiated a number of marketing relationships designed to attract prospective customers 
at the beginning of year  management realigned its strategies and focused instead on wholesale operations  as a result  marketing and advertising expenses decreased 
finet intends to continue to decrease spending on marketing and advertising 
special charges 
special charges decreased million or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the first quarter ended march   finet recorded a  expense related to the purchase of certain loan origination and tracking software and systems that were subsequently determined to be unsuitable 
during the second quarter of  finet recovered  of this amount from the vendor  resulting in a net expense of  during the fourth quarter ended december   finet recorded a non recurring expense of  representing a devalued non interest bearing loan receivable 
at the time of the lowestrate acquisition  finet entered into certain ancillary agreements with the seller of lowestrate  along with a non interest bearing loan  that was secured by shares of finet s common stock 
a reduction in the market price of finet s common stock resulted in this note becoming devalued  therefore  this note was written off as a special charge during the year ended december  special charges of million recorded during the year ended december  relate to the coastal and mical business unit closures and charges of  were to write off the capitalized costs of software that would no longer be used in finet s continuing business strategy 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the twelve months ended december  the increase was due primarily to the amortization of the goodwill associated with the purchase of certain assets and operations of lowestrate 
gain on sale of marketable securities gain on sale of marketable securities increased million or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  finet acquired these marketable securities in october of  and finet sold all of these securities by september  income taxes as of december   finet had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the net operating loss carryforward asset due to the lack of finet s earnings history a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at december  fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues loan volume increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a significant increase in the number of loans funded through finet s mortgage banking subsidiaries  volume attributable to acquired operations  and significant refinancing activity stimulated by relatively low interest rates 
refinancing accounted for of loan volume in fiscal  compared to in fiscal revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the incremental volume of funded loans from mical and increased volumes of originated loans generated by the interloan 
com website  both of which were purchased in the first quarter of fiscal loans originated by mortgage brokers and funded by finet s mortgage banking subsidiaries accounted for million in additional revenues  or of the increase for the year 
loans originated  most of which were funded by lenders other than finet s mortgage banking subsidiaries  accounted for million in additional revenues  or of the increase for the year 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in direct costs associated with increased volumes of funded loans from the purchase of mical  increased indirect production expenses from the purchases of the interloan 
com website and mical  and provisions for losses on mortgages held for sale and receivables 
increased volumes of funded loans accounted for million in additional costs  or of the increase for the year 
indirect production expenses accounted for million in additional costs  or of the increase for the year 
provisions for losses increased by million to million in fiscal from  in fiscal finet records provisions for losses to reflect market valuation allowances on mortgages held for sale and mortgage loans previously sold off balance sheet risk and provisions for doubtful accounts receivable 
finet evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable primarily on a receivable by receivable basis  as accounts receivable is composed of amounts that do not necessarily carry similar risk characteristics  such as amounts heldback by purchasers on sales of mortgage loans and amounts heldback on sales of servicing rights 
additionally  finet maintains communications with such purchasers and others from whom receivables are due and in certain circumstances  determines the allowance necessary based on agreed upon amounts 
finet determines its market valuation allowance relating to mortgages held for sale and mortgages that have been sold primarily on a loan by loan basis 
the allowance is based on factors such as market values  bids received  industry loss experience and finet s prior loss experience  if any  as well as risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
million  or  of the increase in provision for losses was attributable to the provision for doubtful accounts recorded at finet s mical mortgage subsidiary 
mical was acquired by the company in a business combination accounted for as a purchase in may accordingly  the provision for doubtful accounts of mical is included in finet s results of operations only subsequent to the acquisition date only for fiscal  and accounts for the entire increase 
the remaining increase in the provision for losses relates to increased provisions for losses on mortgages held for sale and mortgages previously sold off balance sheet risk 
this increase was attributable primarily to the mical mortgage subsidiary but additionally to provisions for loan losses recorded by the coastal federal mortgage subsidiary 
loans originated at mical and at coastal  acquired in may and april  had risk characteristics and loss recourse provisions that were dissimilar from the risk characteristics and sale recourse provisions of loans originated by other finet subsidiaries prior to the acquisitions of mical and coastal 
gross profit loss gross profit for fiscal decreased by million to a loss of million from a profit of  in fiscal as a result of the increase in our cost of revenues 
operating expenses general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of mical and increased expenses 
marketing and advertising 
marketing and advertising expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from internet advertising expenses 
special charges 
special charges of million were established in fiscal and include million of goodwill writeoff and restructuring charges associated with the discontinuance of the business of mical  a  writedown of purchased software and  to liquidate certain assets and liabilities in connection with the discontinuance of the business of coastal 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in assets acquired with the purchase of mical 
other 
other operating expense for fiscal increased by  or  to million from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from charges recorded to value warrants issued when our convertible debentures were converted to common stock 
other interest expense other interest expense for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of amortization of the imputed interest and debt issuance costs on our convertible subordinated debentures  which were issued in march and may the debt was redeemed in january and the discount has been fully amortized 
income taxes as of april   finet had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
finet s federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at april  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of finet s earnings history 
net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to the purchases of mical and coastal  increased marketing expenses associated with the purchase of interloan 
com  and expenses associated with financing transactions 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues loan volume increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a significant increase in the number of loans funded through finet s mortgage banking subsidiaries and significant refinancing activity stimulated by relatively low interest rates

marketing and advertising 
marketing and advertising expenses for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased advertising expenses associated with the increased level of loan fundings and the introduction of new products 
special charges 
in fiscal  we recorded special charges of million to writeoff intangible assets that we determined would no longer be employed in future operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal increased by  to  from  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to depreciation of fixed assets acquired to support increased business activity and staff expansion 
other

net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and office space in anticipation of growing the business  consulting expenses related to the acquisition of monument in the prior fiscal year  expenses in anticipation of the mical and coastal acquisitions  and intangible asset write downs 
financial condition historically  finet has experienced operating losses and has relied on external sources of debt and equity financing to fund operations to service debt and to make capital investments 
finet s stockholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  stockholders equity decreased primarily due to finet s operating losses incurred in and was partially offset by a million private placement completed during the fourth quarter of and by various warrant and option exercises 
cash decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  cash was used for general operations  to fund some mortgage origination activities by finet s mortgage banking subsidiaries and to make capital investments 
the usage of cash was partially offset by cash received from the private placement offering  the collection of the proceeds on the sale of the servicing portfolio  and  to a lesser extent  from sales of marketable equity securities 
restricted cash decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the reduction represents settlements received on sales of mortgage loans that had not yet been applied to reduce the warehouse line of credit 
subsequent to december   a portion of the warehouse line of credit was paid off with the restricted cash of million 
mortgages held for sale and warehouse borrowings decreased by million and million  respectively  due to intentionally slowing lower margin loan origination  while gearing up to originate a better selection of higher margin loan products 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased as finet completed its spending on professional services relating to the implementation of systems infrastructure required for year preparedness and as marketing expenses substantially decreased 
future improvements in results of operations and financial condition depends on the ability of monument mortgage to significantly increase loan origination volumes  to increase the percentage of higher margin loan products  to become a significant lead generator of lower margin loan products  to achieve highly efficient operations  and to manage warehouse and operating expenses in proportion to loan volume 
finet s financial condition is further dependent on economic conditions such as the general health of the economy and demand for mortgage loans 
there can be no assurances that finet s financial condition or results of operations will improve 
liquidity and capital resources the nature of the mortgage lending business requires monument mortgage to advance cash on a daily basis to fund newly originated loans 
the majority of these funds are provided either through conventional mortgage warehouse lines of credit  through purchase repurchase arrangements  and or through the use of available cash balances 
additional cash resources  obtained primarily through the private placement of finet s common stock are used to fund ongoing expenses such as administration and marketing  to invest in product development  to satisfy debt and other obligations as they come due and to expand the business geographically 
adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding that permit monument mortgage to close and fund mortgage loans are essential 
once the sale of loans is completed and the warehouse line of credit repaid  the resulting increase of capital resources allows monument mortgage to close and fund additional loans 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note borrowing arrangements for additional liquidity and capital resources disclosure on warehouse and other lines of credit 
during the year ended december   operating activities  including general operating expenditures  repayment of warehouse borrowings and funding new loans  used cash of million 
investing activities included investments of million in furniture and fixtures 
finet also received cash of million and million from the sale of its marketable securities and from the sale of mortgage servicing rights  respectively 
financing activities  primarily cash received from the issuance of common stock through private placements  and from option and warrant exercises  provided million during the twelve months ended december  if finet continues to maintain at least the current level of working capital borrowing resources  finet believes that its existing cash balances and funds available through revolving warehouse facilities and purchase repurchase agreements will be sufficient to meet finet s liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
finet does not expect that it will need to arrange for additional sources of capital  however  finet cannot guarantee that it will be able to meet its operational expenses without the need for additional financing  or that it will be able to obtain additional financing if so required 
in the event finet requires  but is unable to obtain  additional financing  finet s growth could slow  and its operations could be adversely affected 
recent developments on february   finet effected a for reverse stock split of its outstanding shares  which had been previously approved by written consent of the majority of its shareholders  in order to meet minimum bid price requirements under the nasdaq smallcap market s listing maintenance criteria 
despite the reverse stock split  finet cannot be certain that it will be able to continue to maintain its listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market and inclusion of finet s common stock on the otc bulletin board  or other similar quotation system  could adversely affect the liquidity and price of finet s common stock 
risk factors that may affect our future performance the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  which  in turn  could cause the price of finet s common stock to decline  resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment 
finet cannot predict which  if any  of these risks may actually occur  or the extent to which any occurrence  circumstance or event will actually affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  and the trading price of finet s common stock 
the loss of any of our key personnel would likely have an adverse effect on finet s business 
finet believes that its future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of senior management and other key personnel  particularly rick cossano  president and chief executive officer  and patrick mackin  chief financial officer and executive vice president 
competition for qualified personnel is fierce in the mortgage industry 
the loss of the services of key employees or delay in recruiting candidates to fill our currently vacant management positions or any other key position which may become vacant could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if finet is unable to attract qualified personnel  its business could suffer 
monument mortgage s future success depends on the ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate additional highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service and professional personnel 
competition for such employees is intense  especially in the e commerce sector  and there is a risk that monument mortgage will not be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
if monument mortgage fails to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service personnel and experienced professionals  finet s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if demand for mortgages decrease  monument mortgage s business could suffer 
demand for mortgages is typically adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown  recession or rising interest rates  declining demand for consumer credit  declining home sales  declining real estate values and decreased ability of borrowers to make loan payments 
these factors tend to decrease the demand for the types of loans originated through monument mortgage 
these changes would likely have a material adverse affect on finet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if monument mortgage is unable to manage growth in the mortgage business  results of operations may not improve 
if monument mortgage is unable to manage the expansion of its business effectively  results of operations and financial condition may not improve and could deteriorate 
to manage the expected growth  monument mortgage will need to improve its mortgage processing  operational and financial systems  information processing capacity  procedures and controls 
monument mortgage may be unable to hire  train  retain or manage necessary personnel  or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
if monument mortgage is unable to differentiate itself from competition in the mortgage banking industry  its business prospects could be harmed 
the residential mortgage loan business is highly competitive and because the barriers to entry are minimal  monument mortgage expects competition to intensify within both the traditional mortgage banking and the internet offered e mortgage market 
monument mortgage currently competes with a variety of other companies offering mortgage services  including o mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions which still originate the vast majority of mortgage loans  such as washington mutual  bank of america and countrywide home loans  inc  o mortgage brokers  o mortgage companies that offer products through on line search engines  such as yahoo and microsoft corporation s home advisor website  and o various on line mortgage brokers  including e loan inc  lendingtree 
com and indymac bank 
many of monument mortgage s mortgage banking and brokerage competitors have longer operating histories or significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
some of monument mortgage s on line competitors are spending substantial funds on mass marketing and branding their mortgage services 
in addition  some of monument mortgage s competitors offer a wider range of services and financial products to customers and have the ability to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities 
as a result  many have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases and can offer more attractive terms to customers  including more aggressive loan pricing policies 
monument mortgage cannot be sure that it will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
if monument mortgage is unable to do so  it will have a material adverse effect on finet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if interest rates rise  monument mortgage s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
rising interest rates generally discourage refinancing of residential mortgages and reduce the number of new home sales 
an increase in interest rates or an adverse change in the residential real estate market or general economic conditions  both of which are outside finet s control  could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of interest rate changes tends to be greater on the market for refinance loans than it is on the market for purchase loans  since refinancing a mortgage loan is voluntary and motivated primarily by the homeowner s desire to lower financing costs  whereas new home purchasers are motivated by a need or desire for a new home 
in the event interest rates significantly increase  borrowers will not have such incentive to refinance  therefore  the number of loans monument mortgage underwrites could be adversely effected 
the value of the loans monument mortgage makes is based  in part  on market interest rates  and monument mortgage s business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if interest rates change rapidly or unexpectedly 
if interest rates rise after monument mortgage fixes a price for a loan but before it sells the loan into the secondary market  the value of that loan will decrease 
if the selling of committed loans is delayed into the secondary market  monument mortgage s interest rate exposure increases and it could incur a loss on the sale 
while monument mortgage uses various hedging strategies to provide some protection against interest rate risks  no hedging strategy can protect monument mortgage completely 
the nature and timing of hedging transactions influences the effectiveness of hedging strategies and poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than decrease risk 
in addition  hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs 
there is a risk that monument mortgage s hedging strategy and the hedges that it makes will not adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and that monument mortgage s hedges will result in losses 
in addition  any increase in interest rates may increase the cost of maintaining monument mortgage s warehouse line of credit and purchase repurchase lines on which monument mortgage greatly depends on to fund the loans it underwrites 
if monument mortgage fails to maintain credit facilities to finance mortgage lending activities  monument mortgage s growth prospects could be severely limited 
to the extent that monument mortgage is unable to access adequate capital to fund loans  monument mortgage may have to curtail or cease its loan funding activities entirely 
this would have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
since monument mortgage is not a depository bank  monument mortgage is dependent upon specialized mortgage credit facilities from other lenders to finance its mortgage lending activities 
in the warehouse line of credit agreement monument mortgage makes numerous representations  warranties and operating and financial covenants 
a material breach by monument mortgage of any of these representations  warranties or covenants could result in the termination of the agreement and an obligation to repay the entire amount outstanding under the agreement 
in the past  monument mortgage has had to obtain waivers from its lender for defaults under the agreement 
at december  monument mortgage was in default under its primary warehouse lending agreement  as it was in violation of certain financial and other covenants 
subsequent to december   the lender waived the defaults  however  monument mortgage cannot assure that it will be able obtain a waiver from its lender of any future defaults  should they occur  or that financing will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all 
if finet is unable to respond to rapid technological changes in e commerce and improve offered products and services  its business could be materially adversely affected 
the internet and e commerce are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render existing technologies and systems obsolete 
there can be no assurances that finet will successfully use new technologies effectively or adapt company websites  technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if finet is unable to license and internally develop leading technologies useful in finet s business  enhance its existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  finet will not remain competitive and the mortgage banking business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if consumers and mortgage broker businesses do not embrace e commerce mortgage financing and sales  monument mortgage s business would be materially adversely affected 
monument mortgage s success partly depends upon the acceptance of on line mortgage financing by consumers  brokers and other real estate service providers 
if the market for electronic mortgage financing fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  finet s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if there are insufficient communications services to support the internet  it could result in slower response times that would adversely affect usage of the internet 
even if use of the internet for e commerce financing gains acceptance  monument mortgage may be unable  for technical or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements in a timely manner  and such products and services and enhancements may not gain widespread market acceptance 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on finet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if monument mortgage has to repurchase loans originated for or sold to investors  finet s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
there is a risk that monument mortgage will not have sufficient funds to repurchase loans upon demand or that such repurchases will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
under agreements with some of monument mortgage s lenders  they may require monument mortgage to repurchase loans that monument mortgage originated for them  or they purchased from monument mortgage  in the event of material misrepresentations by monument mortgage or any inaccuracies found in the borrowers loan documents 
as a result of repurchases  monument mortgage occasionally is required to hold foreclosed residential real estate in inventory until it can be resold 
future foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on monument mortgage s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if interest rates rise and the economy declines  the rate of mortgage loan foreclosures may rise 
depending on the circumstances of the transaction  monument mortgage may or may not be able to sell the property for more than the outstanding loan balance 
as of december   monument mortgage held approximately  aggregate principal amount of loan in foreclosure 
the loss of monument mortgage s relationship with fannie mae  freddie mac or any other significant provider of automated underwriting systems could materially adversely affect finet s results of operations 
monument mortgage depends on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae s desktop underwriter  freddie mac s loan prospector  and gmac rfc s assetwise 
these services help ensure that monument mortgage s mortgage services can be offered efficiently and timely 
monument mortgage currently has an agreement with fannie mae that allows the use of their automated underwriting services and enables monument mortgage to sell them qualified first mortgages 
monument mortgage expects to continue to process a significant portion of its conforming loans using the fannie mae system 
however  monument mortgage s agreements with fannie mae and other mortgage investors can be terminated by either party at any time 
there is a risk that monument mortgage will not remain in good standing with fannie mae and other significant provider of automated underwriting systems and our relationship with them will be terminated 
the termination of monument mortgage s agreement with fannie mae and with other providers of underwriting systems would materially adversely impact monument mortgage s ability to originate loans 
additionally  if the mortgage programs administered by fannie mae and freddie mac or monument mortgage s eligibility to participate in them  were terminated or significantly curtailed  finet s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
monument mortgage pays for its loan operations in part by selling the mortgages that it funds to fannie mae and freddie mac 
monument mortgage s ability to sell loans depends upon the continuation of programs administered by these entities  as well as its continued eligibility to participate in these programs 
monument mortgage also depends upon private mortgage investors  such as gmac rfc  washington mutual bank  credit suisse first boston  and indymac  to purchase loans it funds 
if private investors reduce their purchases of these loans  the market and price for such mortgages will be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
finet may incur additional losses from the discontinued business of coastal and mical mortgage 
in april  finet acquired coastal federal mortgage  and in may  finet also acquired mical mortgage 
finet s results of operations include net losses from the acquisitions of both of these units and from their operating activities 
although these business units were discontinued in april  finet may incur additional losses  which would be included in finet s consolidated results 
finet reported net losses associated with coastal and mical of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
if finet s quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly  the price of finet s common stock is likely to be volatile 
finet s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the following o fluctuations in interest rates  o seasonal or other economic factors affecting demand for mortgages  o changes in monument mortgage s pricing policies or its competitors pricing policies for mortgage origination and processing fees  o the introduction of new mortgage products and services by monument mortgage or its competitors  o the level of consumer interest and confidence in the internet as a means of accessing financial products and services  o any termination or restructuring of agreements with key service providers  and o technical difficulties or service interruptions affecting monument mortgage s websites or operational data processing systems 
fluctuation in finet s quarterly results may cause the price of finet s common stock to be volatile 
accordingly  finet s results for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
finet s operating results may fail to meet management s expectations or those of analysts who follow finet  and any such failure could cause finet s stock price to decline substantially 
if there are interruptions or delays in obtaining appraisal  credit reporting  title searches and other underwriting services from third parties  monument mortgage may experience customer dissatisfaction and difficulties closing loans 
monument mortgage relies on other companies to perform certain aspects of the loan approval process  including appraisals  credit reports and title searches 
if monument mortgage is unsuccessful in securing the timely delivery of these ancillary services  it will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction  and its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the value of the service monument mortgage offers  and thus the ultimate success of monument mortgage s business  are dependent on the ability to secure the timely provision of these ancillary services from third parties 
if monument mortgage fails to comply with extensive federal and state laws regulating the mortgage banking industry  monument mortgage could be subject to penalties  disqualifications  lawsuits or enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on monument mortgage s business 
monument mortgage s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state authorities 
if monument mortgage fails to comply with such regulations  possible consequences could include loss of approved status  demands for indemnification  class action lawsuits  administrative enforcement actions  and other civil and criminal sanctions 
these consequences could have a material adverse effect on monument mortgage s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item business mortgage banking regulation  of annual report on form k for the year ended december  if finet s computer systems fail  finet s business could be materially adversely affected 
any interruption in the availability of monument mortgage s websites  transaction processing systems or network infrastructure could materially adversely affect the business  results of operations and financial condition 
such interruptions could result from events such as fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  computer viruses and electronic breaches 
finet s insurance policies may not adequately compensate for losses that may occur in the event of a failure of the computer systems or other interruptions in finet s or monument mortgage s businesses 
monument mortgage s websites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information  the accuracy and timeliness of which is critical to the mortgage business 
in the past  these systems have experienced periodic interruptions 
any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on the monument mortgage s websites will require expanding and upgrading of its technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
monument mortgage cannot be sure that it will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of the websites  or expand and upgrade the systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
in addition  users depend on third party internet service providers for access to monument mortgage s e commerce tools  and many of these services have experienced significant outages in the past  and users could experience outage delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to monument mortgage s systems 
moreover  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
any of these problems would materially adversely affect finet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if monument mortgage s electronic security devices are breached  finet s business would be materially adversely affected 
if any compromise in monument mortgage s security devices were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on finet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the secure transmission of confidential information through e commerce is critical to monument mortgage s underwriting process  and monument mortgage relies on certain encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information  such as consumers financial statements 
there can be no assurances that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms monument mortgage uses to protect transaction data 
monument mortgage may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet  and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of e commerce in general 
to the extent that monument mortgage s activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  security breaches could damage monument mortgage s reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
there can be no assurances that all of monument mortgage s security measures will prevent security breaches or that a failure to prevent such security breaches will not have a material adverse effect on finet s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if finet s shares are delisted  the liquidity of finet s shares of common stock could be impaired 
if finet fails to meet the nasdaq s continued listing requirements  including  among others  net tangible assets or market capitalization  minimum bid price and various corporate governance requirements  finet s shares could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in such event  any trading in finet s common stock would thereafter be conducted in the over the counter markets in the so called pink sheets or the nasdaq s electronic bulletin board 
consequently  the liquidity of finet s shares could be impaired  not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold  but also through delays in the timing of the transactions  reductions in the number and quality of security analysts and the news media s coverage of finet  and lower prices for its shares than might otherwise be attained 
on august   finet was notified by nasdaq that finet s common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of over the previous consecutive trading days as required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market as set forth in marketplace rule c 
finet was provided calendar days  or until november   to maintain its stock a price of at least for a minimum of consecutive trading days or finet s common stock would be delisted at the opening of business on november  on january   finet was granted a temporary exception from the minimum bid price requirement after finet failed to meet the minimum bid price requirement 
in anticipation of effecting a reverse stock split an exception was granted by the nasdaq smallcap market that was suppose to expire on february  on february   finet effected a for reverse stock split of its outstanding shares  previously approved by written consent of the majority of its shareholders 
despite the reverse stock split  there can be no assurances  that finet will be able to maintain its listing on nasdaq 
delisting from the nasdaq and inclusion of finet s common stock on the otc bulletin board or other similar quotation system could adversely affect the liquidity and price of its stocks if finet s shares of common stock are delisted  finet s shares could become subject to the sec s penny stock rule 
if finet s shares were delisted from nasdaq  they could become subject to rule g under the securities exchange act of  which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers which sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally  individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual incomes exceeding  or  together with their spouses 
for transactions covered by this rule  a broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell finet s shares and may adversely affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell any of the securities acquired in the secondary market 
if finet s shares become subject to this rule  market liquidity for its shares could be severely adversely affected 
if there is a recession  natural disaster or other disruption in the california economy  finet s business could be materially adversely affected 
finet is particularly vulnerable to recessions and conditions affecting the california economy 
of the loans monument mortgage originated and or funded in the year ended december   were for properties located in california 
no other state represented more than of its closed loans during such period 
while monument mortgage expects to expand its business in other states  a concentration of loans in california is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
there have been times in the past  most recently in and  when the california economy suffered a recession more severe than the rest of the country 
if such a recession were to occur again  finet s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  california historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters  such as earthquakes and mudslides  which are not typically covered by standard hazard insurance policies 
these natural disasters often result in increased loan delinquencies or defaults that could adversely effect monument mortgage s  and therefore finet s  business  results of operations and financial condition
