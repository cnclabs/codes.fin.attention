chicago express also provides commuter passenger service between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis  milwaukee  des moines  dayton  grand rapids  madison and south bend 
ata also provides charter service throughout the world to independent tour operators  specialty charter customers and the us military 
the company generated operating income of million  and a net loss of million  for the year ended december  profitability in was severely impacted by fuel prices  which averaged nearly more per gallon than in  and the company s fleet  which is generally older and less fuel efficient 
both the lockheed l and the boeing aircraft operate with three engines  compared to more fuel efficient new aircraft that are powered by two more technologically advanced engines 
in may  the company placed an order for new boeing aircraft and ten new boeing aircraft 
these aircraft will be equipped with boeing s latest technology and equipment  and are significantly more fuel efficient than the company s current three engine aging aircraft 
delivery of the new aircraft is scheduled to begin in may and to be substantially completed by december results of operations in cents per asm the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated oper ating revenues and expenses expressed as cents per asm

during  chicago express operated nine seat jetstream aircraft 
during the first three quarters of  chicago express replaced the jetstream aircraft with nine seat saab b aircraft 
as of september   all jetstream aircraft had been removed from revenue service 
b a departure is a single takeoff and landing operated by a single aircraft between an origin city and a destination city 
c block hours for any aircraft represent the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the origin city boarding ramp to the moment it comes to rest at the destination city boarding ramp 
d revenue passenger miles rpms represent the number of seats occupied by revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
rpms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity actually sold by the company 
e available seat miles asms represent the number of seats available for sale to revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
asms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity offered for sale by the company  whether sold or not 
f passenger load factor is the percentage derived by dividing rpms by asms 
passenger load factor is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because incremental passengers normally provide incremental revenue and profitability when seats are sold individually 
in the case of commercial charter and military government charter  load factor is less relevant because the company sells an entire aircraft instead of individual seats 
since both costs and revenues are largely fixed for these types of charter flights  changes in load factor have less impact on business unit profitability 
consolidated load factors and scheduled service load factors for the company are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but load factors for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
g passengers enplaned are the number of revenue passengers who occupied seats on the company s flights 
this measure is also referred to as passengers boarded 
h revenue per asm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as rasm 
rasm measures the company s unit revenue using total available seat capacity 
in the case of scheduled service  rasm is a measure of the combined impact of load factor and yield see j below for the definition of yield 
i cost per asm expressed in cents is total operating expense divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as casm 
casm measures the company s unit cost using total available seat capacity 
j revenue per rpm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total rpms 
this measure is also referred to as yield 
yield is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because yield is a measure of the average price paid by customers purchasing individual seats 
yield is less relevant to the commercial charter and military government charter businesses because the entire aircraft is sold at one time for one price 
consolidated yields and scheduled service yields are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but yields for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
operating revenues total operating revenues in increased to billion from billion in this increase was due to a million increase in scheduled service revenues  a million increase in military government charter revenues and a million increase in ground package revenues  offset by a million decrease in other revenues and a million decrease in commercial charter revenues

in april  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of chicago express airlines  inc  which then operated seat jetstream propeller aircraft between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis  milwaukee  des moines  dayton  grand rapids  lansing and madison 
chicago express began service to south bend  indiana  in october  and ceased flying to lansing  michigan  in november in the first three quarters of  chicago express completed the replacement of nine seat jetstream aircraft with nine seat saab b aircraft 
all jetstream aircraft were removed from revenue service by september   and are currently being returned to the lessors 
the company anticipates that its chicago midway operation will represent an increasing proportion of its scheduled service business in and beyond 
the company operated peak daily jet and commuter departures from chicago midway in  as compared to in  and served destinations on a nonstop basis in  as compared to nonstop destinations served in in order to accommodate the growth in jet departures in the existing terminal  in october chicago express established a remote boarding operation at chicago midway airport with shuttle bus service between the remote location and the main terminal 
this change has allowed the company to convert the former chicago express gate to a jet departure gate  which will permit further expansion of jet departures in the current concourse facilities 
the company presently expects to occupy jet gates and one commuter aircraft gate on the new chicago midway airport concourses 
eight of the gates which the company will occupy are expected to open in late and five additional gates are expected to be available for use by the company in the company is currently investing in new passenger processing technology for use in the new terminal and expects to occupy ticketing and passenger check in space in the newly constructed chicago midway terminal in the first week of march in addition  the company has begun construction of a fis facility at chicago midway  from which it plans to commence nonstop international services in late due to the importance of chicago midway to the company s scheduled service route network  the initial deliveries of new aircraft are expected to be used primarily in the chicago midway hub 
the company s hawaii service accounted for of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures in  as compared to and  respectively  in the company provided nonstop service in both years from los angeles  phoenix and san francisco to both honolulu and maui  with connecting service between honolulu and maui 
the majority of seats in these markets are sold to independent tour operators  while the company distributes the remaining seats through its normal scheduled service channels 
the company s indianapolis service accounted for of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures in  as compared to and  respectively  in in both years  the company operated nonstop to cancun  ft

myers  las vegas  los angeles service was discontinued as of august  orlando  st 
petersburg and sarasota 
the company has served indianapolis for years through the ambassadair travel club and through scheduled service since the company continuously evaluates the profitability of its scheduled service markets and expects to adjust its schedule and flight frequencies from time to time 
the company  in cooperation with a tour operator partner  began nonstop service to hawaii from chicago o hare international airport and new york s john f 
kennedy international airport in december of commercial charter revenues 
the company s commercial charter revenues are derived principally from independent tour operators and specialty charter customers 
the company s commercial charter product provides full service air transportation to customer designated destinations throughout the world 
commercial charter revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues in as compared to in during the last several years  the company has deployed additional aircraft into its rapidly growing scheduled service markets  reducing the availability of aircraft capacity for commercial and military government charter flying 
the company has addressed its seat capacity limitations in the commercial and military government charter businesses through the acquisition of long range lockheed l aircraft 
although lockheed l maintenance procedures and cockpit design are similar to the company s fleet of lockheed l and aircraft  they differ operationally in that their to hour range permits them to operate nonstop to parts of asia  south america and central and eastern europe using an all coach seating configuration preferred by the us military and most of the company s commercial charter customers 
the deployment of these aircraft into the company s fleet has increased the available seat capacity for the commercial and military government charter business units in addition to opening new long range market opportunities 
the company also uses several of these aircraft for scheduled service to and from hawaii 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the commercial charter operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h rasm less fuel escalation l see footnotes b through h on pages and l commercial charter contracts generally provide that the tour operator will reimburse the company for certain fuel cost increases  which  when earned  are accounted for as additional revenue 
a separate rasm calculation  excluding the impact of fuel reimbursements  is provided as a separate measure of unit revenue changes 
the company operates in two principal components of the commercial charter business  known as track charter and specialty charter 
the larger track charter business component is generally comprised of low frequency but repetitive domestic and international flights between city pairs  which support high passenger load factors and are marketed through tour operators  providing value priced and convenient nonstop service to vacation destinations for the leisure traveler 
since track charter resembles scheduled service in terms of its repetitive flying patterns between fixed city pairs  it allows the company to achieve reasonable levels of crew and aircraft utilization although less than for scheduled service  and provides the company with meaningful protection from some fuel price increases through the use of fuel escalation reimbursement clauses in tour operator contracts 
track charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in specialty charter is a product that is designed to meet the unique requirements of a customer and is a business characterized by lower frequency of operation and by greater variation in city pairs served than the track charter business 
specialty charter includes such diverse contracts as flying university alumni to football games  transporting political candidates on campaign trips and moving nasa space shuttle ground crews to alternate landing sites 
the company also operates trips in an all first class configuration for certain corporate and high end leisure clients 
although lower utilization of crews and aircraft and infrequent service to specialty destinations often result in higher average operating costs  the company has determined that the revenue premium earned by meeting special customer requirements more than compensates for these increased costs 
the diversity of the company s three fleet types also permits the company to meet a customer s particular needs by choosing the aircraft type that provides the most economical solution for those requirements 
specialty charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in military government charter revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the military government charter operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h rasm less fuel escalation m see footnotes b through h on pages and m military government reimbursements to the company are calculated based upon a cost plus formula  including an assumed average fuel price for each contract year 
if actual fuel prices differ from the contract rate  revenues are adjusted up or down to neutralize the impact of the change on the company 
a separate rasm calculation is provided  excluding the impact of the fuel price adjustments 
the company participates in two related military government charter programs known as fixed award and short term expansion 
pursuant to the us military s fixed award system  each participating airline is awarded certain mobilization value points based upon the number and type of aircraft made available by that airline for military flying 
in order to increase the number of points awarded  the company has traditionally participated in contractor teaming arrangements with other airlines 
under these arrangements  the team has a greater likelihood of receiving fixed award business and  to the extent that the award includes passenger transport  the opportunity for the company to operate this flying is enhanced since the company represents a majority of the passenger transport capacity of its team 
as part of its participation in this teaming arrangement  the company pays a commission to the team  which passes that revenue on to all team members based upon their mobilization value points 
all airlines participating in the fixed award business contract annually with the us military from october to the following september for each contract year  reimbursement rates are determined for aircraft types and mission categories based upon operating cost data submitted by the participating airlines 
these contracts generally are not subject to renegotiation once they become effective 
short term expansion business is awarded by the us military first on a pro rata basis to those carriers who have been provided fixed award business and then to any other carrier with aircraft availability 
short term expansion flying is generally offered to airlines on very short notice 
the overall amount of military flying that the company performs in any one year is dependent upon several factors  including i the percentage of mobilization value points represented by the company s team as compared to total mobilization value points of all providers of military service  ii the percentage of passenger capacity of the company with respect to its own team  iii the amount of fixed award and expansion flying required by the us military in each contract year  and iv the availability of the company s aircraft to accept and fly expansion awards 
under its current teaming arrangement  the company expects its military government charter revenues to decrease to approximately million for the contract year ending september this represents a decrease from million earned in the contract year ending september ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental  cruise and other accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company traditionally marketed these ground packages to its ambassadair travel club members and to its scheduled service passengers through its ata vacations subsidiary 
however  since the acquisition of new tour operator businesses in the detroit area in  the travel charter and key tours brands in detroit have accounted for a significant portion of the company s ground package sales 
the company s ambassadair travel club offers tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members annually 
ata leisure corp 
offers numerous ground accommodations to the general public in many areas of the united states 
these packages are marketed through travel agents  as well as directly by the company 
in  ground package revenues increased to million  as compared to million in the number of ground packages sold and the average revenue earned by the company for a ground package sale are a function of the seasonal mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered and general competitive conditions in the company s markets  all of which factors can change from period to period 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of certain affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled  charter and ground package operations of the company 
other revenues decreased to million in  as compared to million in operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related local  state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million from million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by approximately between and this growth was most significant in categories of employees that are influenced directly by flight activity  such as flight crews and maintenance staff 
beginning in may  the company replaced its contracted ground handler at its busiest airport  chicago midway  with its own ramp employees 
although this contributed to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits  the company experienced a corresponding reduction in handling  landing and navigation fees 
some further employment growth in was also provided to improve customer service in targeted areas by increasing customer service staff  such as at airport ticket counters  in reservations facilities and in other staff groups primarily involved in delivering services to the company s customers 
staff increases also occurred for chicago express as a result of increased passengers boarded due to the conversion from seat to seat aircraft in the first nine months of the company was also adversely affected by a significant increase in employee benefit costs in  as compared to these increases in salaries  wages and benefits costs were partially offset by the elimination of employee incentive awards in in  the company expensed million in accrued incentive awards while no incentive awards were earned in fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company consumed more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations between and  which resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million between periods 
jet fuel consumption increased primarily due to the increased number of block hours of jet flying operations between periods 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  an increase of between years 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed increased by as compared to  resulting in an increase in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between periods 
the company contacts with most commercial charter customers  the us military  and with certain bulk seat purchasers to provide for fuel escalation revenue  which partially offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
in  the company recognized million in fuel escalation revenue  as compared to million recognized in the company implemented a fuel hedge program beginning in the third quarter of this program currently consists of swap agreements for heating oil 
the company uses heating oil swaps to hedge its jet fuel risk because heating oil trades publicly on an exchange and is a refined oil product like jet fuel 
heating oil and jet fuel also demonstrate a strong price correlation 
as of december   the company has entered into swap agreements for approximately million gallons of heating oil for future delivery between january and september  which represents approximately of total expected fuel consumption for that period 
the company expects that high prices for jet fuel will continue to negatively impact its profitability in future quarters 
the company expects to begin generating significant fuel consumption savings  however  as it introduces its new fleet of boeing and aircraft between and the twin engine boeing aircraft are expected to burn fewer gallons per block hour than the company s three engine boeing aircraft 
the company estimates that  as compared to the actual fuel burn of its boeing fleet in  had that flying been done by a fleet of boeing aircraft  fuel consumption savings would have been approximately million at fuel prices prevailing in future fuel consumption savings will vary according to the actual price of jet fuel  and the company will not realize the full benefit of this higher fuel efficiency until the fleet transition is completed in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation reflects the periodic expensing of the recorded cost of owned airframes and engines  leasehold improvements and rotable parts for all fleet types  together with other property and equipment owned by the company 
amortization is primarily the periodic expensing of capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all fleet types on a units of production basis using aircraft flight hours and cycles landings as the units of measure 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in  as compared to million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes  engines and leasehold improvements increased million in  as compared to the company added four owned l s  to the company s fleet from late through the company also purchased seven hushkits for aircraft and two spare engines for the l s late in through the company also increased its investment in rotable parts  furniture and fixtures  and computer hardware and software  and increased its provision for amortization of inventory obsolescence and debt issue costs between years 
these changes resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of million in  as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in  as compared to  after including amortization of related manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the increase in total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods for the lockheed l fleet  since such expense varies with that activity  and partly due to the completion of more engine and airframe overhauls in for the boeing and lockheed l fleets 
rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  thirteen of which were delivered new from the manufacturer since late  are starting to generate engine and airframe overhaul expense 
this resulted in a million increase in amortization costs between periods 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these early engine failures increased million in  as compared to when these early engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
the current depreciable life of assets related to the l and aircraft assumes a common retirement date for the fleet of december  with continuously increasing repair costs and the fuel inefficiency of this fleet  the company has begun re evaluating this decision 
the company is considering retiring each l and aircraft prior to its next scheduled heavy maintenance check 
to ensure the correct economic decision  the company is performing an extensive analysis of expected revenue generation and operating cost of each aircraft in this fleet 
as of december   this analysis is not yet complete 
two aircraft in the fleet are scheduled for heavy maintenance checks in the first quarter of these aircraft cannot be operated past these dates unless the necessary scheduled heavy maintenance is performed 
as of december   the company is uncertain whether this required maintenance will be performed or whether these two aircraft will be retired 
the net book value of these two aircraft less anticipated salvage value  as of december  was approximately million 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security  cargo and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
where the company uses its own employees to perform ground handling functions  the resulting cost appears within salaries  wages and benefits 
air navigation fees are incurred when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased by to million in as compared to million in the total number of system wide jet departures between and increased by to  from  the lower rate of growth in handling costs in  as compared to the growth in departures  was partly due to the implementation of self handling on the ramp at chicago midway airport beginning in may  which was done with third party contractors during all of a corresponding increase in salaries  wages benefits attributable to self handling was experienced during the remainder of aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for increased to million from million in the company accepted delivery of six boeing aircraft from the manufacturer two in the fourth quarter of  two in june and two in november  adding million to aircraft rentals expense in  as compared to chicago express aircraft rentals increased by million in as compared to  due to the replacement of seat jetstream aircraft with seat saab b aircraft 
the company also incurred million in higher rentals in  as compared to  due to the lease of spare engines to support the boeing and lockheed l fleets 
the company purchased boeing aircraft between the first quarter of and fourth quarter of  which had previously been financed through operating leases  resulting in a decrease in aircraft rentals of million between periods 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for maintenance activities and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
aircraft maintenance  materials repair expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company performed a total of maintenance checks on its fleet during as compared to in the cost of materials consumed and components repaired in association with such checks and other maintenance activity increased by million between and the company recognized an increase in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs of million in  as compared to  due to the consolidation of the results of its wholly owned subsidiary  chicago express 
the results of operation for chicago express were consolidated with the company beginning in may crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel consists primarily of the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crewmembers incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate company flights throughout the world 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in as compared to million in positioning and hotel costs increased significantly in due primarily to the substantial increase in military departures in  as compared to military flights often operate to and from points remote from the company s crew bases  thus requiring significant positioning expenditures for cockpit and cabin crews on other airlines 
also  due to heavy airline industry load factors in  the company paid higher average fares to position crews 
average hotel costs are higher for military operations since hotel rates at international locations generally exceed domestic us hotel rates 
ground package cost 
ground package cost is incurred by the company with hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors who provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and ata leisure corp 
atalc customers 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in ground package costs increased in proportion to the increase in ground package revenues 
passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the costs of onboard meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and in flight movie headsets sold  and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service increased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced an increase of approximately in the average unit cost of catering each passenger between and  primarily because in there were relatively more military passengers in the company s business mix  who are provided a more expensive catering product due to military catering specifications and the longer average duration of these flights 
this resulted in a price and business mix increase of million in catering expense in  as compared to total jet passengers boarded  however  increased between years  resulting in approximately million in higher volume related catering expenses between the same sets of comparative periods 
in  as compared to  the company experienced increased departure delays over minutes of 
these irregular operations resulted in higher costs to handle inconvenienced passengers and misconnected baggage 
in  as compared to  such costs were million higher 
commissions 
the company incurs commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of vacation packages and single seats on scheduled service 
in addition  the company incurs commissions to secure some commercial and military government charter business 
commissions expense stayed constant at million between and the company incurred higher military commissions expense of million in  as compared to  which is consistent with growth in military revenues between years 
these increases were largely offset by decreases in scheduled service commissions paid of million due to an industry reduction in travel agency commission from to effective in the fourth quarter of other selling expenses 
other selling expenses comprise primarily fees paid to computer reservation systems crs for scheduled service bookings  credit card discount expenses incurred when selling single seats and ground packages to customers using credit cards for payment  and toll free telephone services provided to single seat and vacation package customers who contact the company directly to book reservations 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of this increase in resulted from an increase in crs fees 
this increase resulted partially from the growth in single seat sales volumes between periods and because of an increase in rates charged by crs systems for improved booking functionality 
credit card discount expense increased million as compared to  primarily due to higher volumes of scheduled service tickets sold using credit cards as form of payment 
toll free telephone services decreased by million in  as compared to  due to billing rate reductions secured from related vendors 
advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company routinely incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of air and ground packages 
such expenses were higher in the spring and summer months of  as advertising support was provided for the introduction of scheduled service to the new destinations of boston  seattle  washington  dc and minneapolis st 
paul 
advertising also increased due to increased marketing emphasis on commuter and florida markets in facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals include the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in growth in facilities costs between periods was primarily attributable to the need to provide facilities at airport locations to support new scheduled service destinations and expanded services at existing destinations 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in the purchase by atalc of charter air services from airlines other than the company was million less in than in due to the increased utilization of the company s own aircraft for atalc charter programs 
in  the company incurred million in chicago express code share expenses  which were not incurred during any period in other expenses included in this category increased in as a general rule with the increase in the company s flight activity 
expenses increasing year over year included flight simulator rentals  professional fees  insurance and supplies 
the company also incurred higher costs associated with irregular flight operations in  as compared to interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to changes in the company s capital structure resulting from the sale in december of million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
interest expense of million was recorded in  applicable to these notes  which was not incurred in the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  as compared to million in  when less cash was available for such investment 
other income 
other income decreased to million in  as compared to million in the company holds a membership interest in the sita foundation sita  an organization that provides data communication services to the airline industry 
sita s primary asset is its ownership in equant nv equant 
in february and december  sita sold a portion of its interest in equant in a secondary public offering and distributed the pro rata proceeds to certain of its members including the company that elected to participate in the offering 
the company recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of and a similar gain of million in the fourth quarter of income tax expense 
in  the company recorded million in income tax credits applicable to million of pre tax loss for that period  while in income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million 
the effective tax rate applicable to credits in was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in income tax expense in both sets of comparative periods was affected by the permanent non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of a percentage of certain amounts paid for crew per diem in and in 
the effect of this and other permanent differences on the effective income tax rate for financial accounting purposes is to increase the effective rate as amounts of pre tax income decrease and to decrease tax credit otherwise applicable to pre tax losses

operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by approximately in  as compared to  in order to appropriately staff the company s growth between periods

the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  an increase of between years 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed increased by as compared to  resulting in an increase in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years

changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the increase in total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods for the boeing and lockheed l fleets since such expense varies with that activity  and partly due to the completion of more engine and airframe overhauls between periods for these fleet types 
rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  nine of which were delivered new from the manufacturer between late and late  are not presently generating any engine or airframe overhaul expense since the initial post delivery overhauls for these aircraft are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs decreased million in  as compared to when these early engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense

many of these departures were to destinations with significantly higher handling costs and landing fees  and proportionately more such departures were made by wide body l aircraft  which incur higher handling and landing costs per departure 
these price and departure mix variances resulted in million more handling and landing costs in than in the company incurred approximately million in higher deicing costs in  as compared with  attributable to the impact of more winter weather on flight operations in than in additionally  the company recorded approximately million in higher cargo handling expenses in  as compared to  due to the acquisition of tg shown associates  inc in january aircraft rentals
