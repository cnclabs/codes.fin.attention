jabil is one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to electronics oems in the communications  computer  peripherals  automotive and consumer products industries 
while operating income and net income decreased in fiscal year  jabil has historically experienced substantial growth in net revenue  operating income and net income 
this growth  as well as the growth of the overall ems industry  has been driven by the increasing number of electronics oems who are outsourcing their manufacturing requirements 
we anticipate that this industry trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from oem customers 
we recognize revenue  net of product return and warranty costs  typically at the time of product shipment 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory adjustments 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of a component based on the costs of materials in that product and a component based on the labor and manufacturing overhead allocation to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor costs and manufacturing overhead for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low volume production  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years  through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in research and development of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expense of these research and development activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated financial statements 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
substantially all of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united sates are denominated in local currencies 
we occasionally hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts  the amount and cost of which have not been material 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
we continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into a business sale agreement with marconi plc marconi to acquire certain operations of its communications division located in the united states  england  italy and germany 
on june   we consummated the english and italian portions of the acquisition and modified certain terms of the transaction 
the acquisition price of the english and italian portions was approximately million and is being accounted for under the purchase accounting method 
the acquisition is anticipated to result in intangible assets  including goodwill  of approximately million  based on management s preliminary valuation 
the allocation of the acquisition price will be based on appraisals and final analysis of management 
the acquired assets were used by marconi to manufacture printed circuit board assemblies for their communications division 
simultaneous with the closings  we entered into a product supply agreement to continue to produce both existing and new products for marconi in new product introduction  printed circuit board assembly  as well as repair of access  optical transmission and broadband switching products 
on september   the company completed the portion of the transaction related to the united states and we anticipate completing the german portion of the acquisition during fiscal the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition 
see factors affecting future results we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fas statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company plans to early adopt statements and beginning in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending august  see note and to the consolidated financial statements 
statement will require upon adoption of statement  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized intangibles of approximately million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  the company has not completed its analysis of the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during this fiscal year  we completed greenfield expansions in brussels  belgium  tiszaujvaros  hungary and chihuahua  mexico 
the hungarian facility is approximately  square feet and began production in the fall of in chihuahua  two  square foot facilities were constructed to add capacity in mexico 
we also completed expansions of existing manufacturing sites in north america and opened an additional jabil global services facility in brussels  belgium 
the ems industry has experienced rapid growth over the past several years as an increasing number of oems have outsourced their manufacturing requirements 
oems are turning to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost  achieve accelerated time to market and time to volume production  access advanced design and manufacturing technologies  improve inventory management and purchasing power  reduce their capital investment in manufacturing facilities  and achieve parallel manufacturing of the same product throughout the world 
we believe that further growth opportunities exist for ems providers to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets

our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to a increase in production of communications products  a increase in production of consumer products and a increase in production of peripheral products 
these increases were offset by a decrease in production of computer products due to softening demand in that sector 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of revenue for fiscal the increase in foreign source revenue was attributable to increased production in our international locations  primarily in our mexican  malaysian and hungarian facilities  and from incremental revenue resulting from the marconi acquisitions in england and italy during the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year reflecting a higher content of material based revenue as well as relatively lower levels of capacity utilization than in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in staffing and related departmental expenses at all of our locations along with increases in information systems staff to support the expansion of our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year as a result of the establishment of a new design center located in our michigan facility as well as expanded services in other locations 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase is attributable to the amortization of the goodwill arising from the marconi acquisition during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements will change the way we account for amortization of goodwill in future periods by requiring us to no longer amortize goodwill 
we will also be required to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
we are currently reviewing this statement to determine the impact its adoption will have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow

in fiscal year  our effective tax rate decreased to from in fiscal year the effective tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations 
our international operations have been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in malaysia  china and hungary 
such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to comply

gives effect to a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record on march  and on february  liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations from the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings  private placement debt  borrowings on a revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations 
in may  we issued a total of million  year  convertible subordinated notes at par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes mature on may  and pay interest semiannually on may and november each note is convertible at any time after the date of original issuance and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date by the holder at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on may in the years   and at par plus accrued interest 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock valued at of its market price 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after may  at of principal plus accrued interest 
the net proceeds from the offering are anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions 
a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the initial marconi acquisition closing 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
at august  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and short term investments  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  an accounts receivable securitization program and proceeds from the convertible notes issuance 
we have committed line of credit facilities in place with a syndicate of banks that provide up to million of working capital borrowing capacity  million of which is provided for under a three year facility 
the remaining million is provided for under a separate day agreement 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of august  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended august  was million 
this consisted primarily of million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization and million of decreases in inventory  offset by million of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million of decreases in taxes payable 
the decreases in inventory and accounts payable were due to reduced levels of business during the second half of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we experienced levels of reduced demand from many of our customers in response to the general economic downturn 
inventory levels and purchases were decreased in line with new levels of expected demand 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended august  consisted of our capital expenditures of million for construction and equipment worldwide and cash paid of million in the acquisition of certain assets of marconi plc  net of million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
in the early part of fiscal  capital expenditures were made to complete the construction of our greenfield facilities in tiszaujvaros  hungary and chihuahua  mexico as well as to expand our existing facilities in north america 
purchases of manufacturing and computer equipment were made to support our ongoing business throughout the year 
despite the economic downturn experienced in the last half of fiscal  we continue to invest in capital assets necessary to support both our existing business levels and our expected future capacity needs 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended august  resulted primarily from million in net proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes  million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan and million of proceeds from grants received from the scottish government  offset in part by the repayment of an installment of principal on our private placement debt 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements over the past several years  we have experienced significant growth 
as a result  we have used cash to finance our working capital needs 
in the event that we experience similar growth in the future  we may need to finance such growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
during the quarter ended november   we filed a shelf registration statement registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future from time to time to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
in august  we effectively increased the amount of unissued securities under our shelf registration statement to billion 
the may offering of million in convertible notes and the june offering of million shares of our common stock was made pursuant to that registration statement 
in august  we established a million account receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks with an expiration date in august  which was later extended to november we renewed the facility with a new funding capacity of million in november there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at august  interest is payable based on designated commercial paper rates plus agreed upon margins 
in may  the company also established a day  million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at august  we believe that during fiscal year  our capital expenditures will exceed million  principally for machinery  equipment  facilities and related expenses 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings  and funds provided by operations  will be more than adequate to fund these capital expenditure and working capital requirements for fiscal consummating any significant amount of additional acquisition opportunities  which we regularly explore  would increase our capital needs and  possibly  result in our need to increase our borrowings and access to public and private debt and equities markets 
see factors affecting future results we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
factors affecting future results our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the level and timing of customer orders the composition of the costs of sales between materials and labor and manufacturing overhead price competition our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product the degree of automation used in our assembly process the efficiencies achieved by us in managing inventories and fixed assets fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results 
because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   our four largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and customers accounted for over of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   cisco systems  inc and dell computer corporation  accounted for approximately and of our net revenue  respectively 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers whose industries have experienced rapid technological change  short product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 
most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity 
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products our customers attempts to manage their inventory electronic design changes changes in our customers manufacturing strategy acquisitions of or consolidations among customers recessionary conditions in customers industries due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
in addition  the current business environment resulting from uncertainties relating to terrorist activities and economic recession has made planning even more complex 
a business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
we compete with numerous providers of electronic manufacturing services  including our current or potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally 
the electronic manufacturing services business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including celestica  inc  flextronics international  sanmina corporation  sci systems  inc and solectron corporation 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  electronic manufacturing services 
most of our competitors have international operations and some have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  and marketing resources than us 
we also face potential competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of outsourcing 
see business competition 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our profitability could decline 
we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any delay in integrating our new information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs 
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in eleven of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location 
we are in the process of installing this system in our remaining plants which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these new information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions that are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and possible adverse tax and accounting effects 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  and unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations 
we have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from oem s 
in these acquisitions  the divesting oem will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror 
therefore  the competition for these acquisitions is intense 
in addition  certain oem s may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other oem s 
if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities  our growth could be adversely impacted 
our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks  including our ability to meet volume  product quality  timeliness and pricing requirements  and our ability to achieve the oem s expected cost reduction 
in addition  when acquiring manufacturing operations  we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules 
accordingly  in these circumstances  we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues 
we may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements 
as a result of these and other risks  these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits 
substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced significant levels of short term interruption of our operations  and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components procurement 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
we derived over of our revenues from international operations in fiscal year we currently operate outside the united states in brussels  belgium  contagem  brazil  dan shui  panyu  and shenzhen  china  coventry and liverpool  england  sheung shui  hong kong  tiszaujvaros  hungary  dublin  ireland  bergamo and marcianise  italy  penang  malaysia  tokyo  japan  chihuahua and guadalajara  mexico  and livingston  scotland 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our us income taxes in addition  several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  the loss of which could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees 
failure to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise could harm our results of operations 
the market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
we are continually evaluating the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide manufacturing services which meet our customers changing needs  maintain technological leadership  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
we cannot assure you that our process development efforts will be successful 
see business technology and research and development 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
certain of our existing stockholders have significant control 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean beneficially owns 
as a result  our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
our stock price may be volatile due to factors beyond our control 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in the contract manufacturing  communications  computer peripherals  personal computer  automotive or consumer products industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law may discourage certain takeover transactions 
the corporation law of the state of delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may  in effect  discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place 
we recently adopted a stockholder rights agreement  which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire jabil in a transaction that our board of directors opposes 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock  or could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facilities at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
as of august   we did not have outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we also have funding costs associated with the asset backed securitization 
costs are in part based on commercial paper rates 
as of august   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the asset backed securitization 
an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rate is determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk sensitive financial instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
financial instruments include cash equivalents  which are available for immediate withdrawal 
long term debt instruments are subject to a fixed interest rate and maturity schedule 
short term interest rate changes can impact interest expense on our variable rate credit facility and asset backed securitization  however  no amounts were outstanding on either of the facilities as of august  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and factors affecting future results we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations  and an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition
