liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was approximately million 
management continues to believe that the real estate market is overvalued and accordingly recent acquisitions have been limited to those select properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that the available working capital along with the million of availability on the revolving credit facility discussed below  puts it in an opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio as attractive long term opportunities become available 
the company s portfolio of available for sale securities had a fair market value of approximately million at december   reflecting pretax unrealized holding gains of approximately million 
included in these marketable securities was approximately million of common stock in a publicly traded company for which the board chairman and another director of the company are directors 
effective december   the company entered into a credit agreement with three banks which provides for both a million revolving credit facility revolver and a million term loan term loan 
each of the three banks participates in the revolver while only one of the banks is a participant in the term loan 
under the revolver  the company will be provided with eligibility based upon the sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of unencumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at  ii the lesser of million or of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of unencumbered eligible hotel properties  as defined  capitalized at  iii the lesser of million or of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of encumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at and iv the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
at december   eligibility under the revolver was million  based upon the above terms 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  including minimum consolidated equity  interest coverage  debt service coverage and capital expenditures other than for real estate 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the credit agreement also contains provisions which allow the banks to perfect a security interest in certain operating and real estate assets in the event of a default  as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolver  at the company s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate or at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the revolver expires on december  at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
the term loan bears interest at day libor plus at december  and is payable in quarterly installments of  with the final payment due on september  at december   there was approximately million outstanding on the term loan 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement the swap to effectively convert its floating rate term loan to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future expense 
under the swap  the company agreed to exchange with the counterparty a commercial bank the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
the fair value of the swap and changes in the fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the financial statements 
the differential to be paid or received on the swap is recognized over the term of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and filed an action against certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred in these matters 
settlements have been reached with all carriers in this matter 
see note  contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this matter 
the current liabilities of the company have historically exceeded its current assets principally due to the financing of the purchase of long term assets utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgage obligations without the corresponding current asset for such properties 
future financial statements may reflect current liabilities in excess of current assets 
management is confident that through cash flow generated from operations  together with borrowings available under the revolving credit facility discussed below and the sale of select assets  all obligations will be satisfied as they come due 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and accordingly current year purchases in excess of par value have reduced retained earnings 
during  the company purchased and retired  shares of the company s common stock for approximately  future repurchases of the company s common stock will also reduce retained earnings by amounts in excess of the par value 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that future operational cash needs and the cash required to repurchase the company s common stock will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  equity securities  ongoing operations and borrowings under the revolver 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans will come from existing funds  borrowings under the revolver  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
funds of the company in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally in the management of its interest rate exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in both common and preferred equity issues 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general levels of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company s available for sale and trading securities consist of us investments in both common and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and self amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties 
the company s term loan has a variable rate but is effectively hedged by an interest rate swap agreement  whose notional amount matches the principal balance of the variable rate debt it hedges 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as the european  south american and asian markets 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of the company s receivables are denominated in french francs and are exposed to changes in exchange rates with the us dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against the french franc  the value of the nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens the functional currency amount of sales increases 
overall  the company is a net receiver of french francs and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar but is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to the french franc 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commodities principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metals purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact materials pricing 
the company is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  it does enter into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally do not exceed twelve months which tend to minimize short term currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results  however  could be significantly affected by fluctuations in metals pricing 
the following is a tabular presentation of quantitative market risks at december principal notional amount by expected maturity fair there value dollars in thousands after total assets available for sale securities    trading securities    notes receivable    average interest rate liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate libor interest rate derivative financial instruments related to variable rate debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable  average pay rate average receive rate business trends total revenues were million versus million during operating income during this period was million versus million in  an increase of million or 
net income was million or per basic share in versus million or per basic share in  representing a increase in earnings per basic share over the prior year 
real estate operations continue to contribute to the company s strong financial performance 
operating income generated from this segment during was million on revenues of million 
the long term nature of the company s property leases as well as continued mortgage amortization continues to provide the solid financial base for these results 
the company s engineered products segment posted a increase in operating profit as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales from this segment of million or over levels 
these results reflect management s continued commitment to grow this segment and pursue new sales opportunities  including new geographical markets for its existing products and new applications for its core technologies
