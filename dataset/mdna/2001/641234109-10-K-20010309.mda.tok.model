business environment domestic equity markets suffered widespread losses in  as technology stocks suffered a dramatic decline and investors grew nervous about signs of a slowing economy 
the standard poor s s p index  which has become heavily weighted toward the technology sector  turned in its first negative performance in ten years  dropping 
profit warnings from a number of companies sparked heavy selling during the fourth quarter  particularly among technology shares  which drove the nasdaq composite to a loss for international stock markets did not escape the fallout  as the morgan stanley capital international europe  australasia  far east index fell in as investors sought a safe haven  the fixed income markets rallied strongly in the latter part of the lehman brothers aggregate bond index returned for the year 
the bond market s healthy returns were powered in large part by the us treasury department s decision to buy back its own bonds  in reaction to the shrinking federal deficit 
the treasury s actions helped to drive treasury bond yields to two year lows 
the yield on the year us treasury bond ended the year at 
concerns remain over the us economy s prospects 
corporate earnings growth has slowed dramatically  and consumer confidence has slipped as well 
these indicators of an economic slowdown prompted the federal reserve board  which had been tightening credit all through  to change course abruptly in january  cutting interest rates by a full percentage point in two steps 
the stock market also remains highly volatile 
overall  the price to earnings p e ratio for the s p index fell back to at december   a significant drop from its record setting peak of at year end nonetheless  a p e ratio of is still historically high  and may indicate further volatility ahead 
in this environment  we remain confident that our diversified family of investment products and services will help us weather turbulent markets 
despite the erratic securities markets of  we increased our assets under management by to billion 
notably  the value style of investing is returning to favor  as the s p barra value index outperformed the s p barra growth index in for the first time in seven years 
while we offer all styles of investing  we believe our longstanding expertise in value investing will serve us well in a difficult market environment 
we also believe that the difficult conditions of could convince more investors both individual and institutional of the inherent value  over the long term  in seeking professional advice and guidance for the management of their money 
general our revenues are recorded in the business segments in which they are earned 
we derive our revenues primarily from fees for investment advisory and administrative services provided to our private asset management  mutual fund  institutional and wrap fee clients 
investment advisory and administrative fees that we earn are generally based on the total market value and composition of assets under management 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and client asset additions and withdrawals have a direct effect on our net revenues and net income 
our fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on actively managed equity accounts and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management accounts 
through our broker dealer  neuberger berman  llc  we earn commissions by executing equity securities transactions for private asset management  mutual fund and institutional clients as well as for third parties in professional investor clearing services and research sales transactions 
the majority of our commissions are earned from transactions for private asset management clients 
our commissions may fluctuate based on general market conditions 
also  through neuberger berman  llc  we earn clearance fees for the execution of securities transactions for various introducing brokers 
we generate additional income by managing cash balances available as a result of our broker dealer activities 
the three principal areas from which we generate net interest income are treasury management managing overnight cash balances  securities lending activities and client cash and margin balances 
we evaluate these activities by focusing on net interest income 
net interest income fluctuates based on general market conditions  prevailing interest rates and the amount of client cash and margin balances 
our operating expenses include direct expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits  information technology and rent and occupancy  and indirect expenses  such as general and administrative  research  execution and clearance expenses 
direct expenses are charged to the business segment in which they are incurred while indirect expenses are allocated to each business segment based upon various methodologies determined by management 
our largest operating expense is employee compensation and benefits  the most significant component being variable compensation for portfolio managers and sales personnel  which is based largely on commissions and advisory fees 
historically  because we had operated as a partnership  substantially all payments to our principals were accounted for as distributions from principals capital and not recorded as compensation expense 
on october   the principals of neuberger berman  llc and the shareholders of neuberger berman management inc exchanged their ownership interests for million shares of our common stock the exchange 
on october   we completed our ipo 
in that offering  we sold million shares of common stock and received net proceeds after expenses of approximately million 
in addition  certain of our stockholders who received our common stock in the exchange sold  shares of that stock in the ipo 
we did not receive the proceeds from the sale of that stock 
in connection with our ipo  we incurred pre tax reorganization and ipo charges totaling approximately million the reorganization and ipo charges 
the reorganization and ipo charges were principally comprised of an initial  irrevocable non cash contribution of common stock to our employee defined contribution stock incentive plan the stock incentive plan of million  a cash contribution to the neuberger berman foundation of million and severance and other charges of million 
to allow for a more consistent analysis of expenses  these reorganization and ipo charges have not been directly considered in the discussion of operating results 
prior to the exchange  neuberger berman  llc did not pay united states federal and state taxes because  as a limited liability company  it was treated as a partnership for tax purposes  and our principals were taxed on their proportionate share of neuberger berman  llc s taxable income or loss 
neuberger berman management inc  as an s corporation  also did not pay united states federal taxes prior to the exchange  but was subject to certain state and local taxes  and its shareholders were responsible for their own federal income taxes 
effective with the exchange  we became subject to federal  state and local income taxes and we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
results of operations our business is divided functionally into three major business segments private asset management  mutual fund and institutional and professional securities services 
our private asset management segment provides customized investment management services for high net worth individuals  families and smaller institutions 
the investment advisory and administrative services that we provide through our mutual fund and institutional segment include the management of the neuberger berman family of mutual funds  investment management of institutional separate account products and broker advised products wrap accounts 
our professional securities services segment provides trade execution  clearing  custody  margin financing  portfolio reporting and trust services  as well as consulting advice 
a fourth segment  corporate  was introduced during the fourth quarter of to reflect certain corporate results that were previously allocated primarily to our professional securities services segment 
prior periods have been revised to conform with this presentation 
each of our business segments represents a grouping of financial activities and products with similar characteristics

liquidity and capital resources our investment advisory business does not require us to maintain significant capital balances 
however  as a result of our broker dealer activities  our statements of financial condition include higher levels of assets and liabilities than is typical for an investment adviser of our size 
our broker dealer activities provide financing  trade execution  clearing and custody services for clients of the private asset management  mutual fund and institutional and professional securities services segments 
our financial condition is highly liquid with the significant majority of our assets readily convertible to cash 
our receivables from and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations represent either current open transactions that settle within a few days or the activity of securities lending that is collateralized and normally can be closed out within a few days 
our receivables from and payables to clients arise in the normal course of business in connection with cash and margin securities transactions 
these client receivables are secured by securities held as collateral 
our cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change from to is primarily attributable to a net increase in receivables from brokers and dealers resulting from stock lending activities 
we expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will continue to serve as the principal source of working capital in our near future 
our cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in is due to the acquisition of the private asset management business of delta capital management llc and an increase in capital expenditures for furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
our cash flows used in financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to the net effect from capital distributions and common stock issuance in related to the ipo 
it is our policy to monitor and evaluate continuously the adequacy of our capital 
we have consistently maintained net capital in excess of the regulatory requirements for broker dealers prescribed by the sec and other regulatory authorities 
at december   our regulatory net capital exceeded the minimum requirement by approximately million 
the rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the sec for certain withdrawals of capital 
in addition  the debt covenants related to neuberger berman  llc s million outstanding subordinated note include certain covenants that limit the percentage by which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of subordinated liabilities exceed total regulatory capital and impose a dollar amount below which total ownership equity cannot fall 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing committed and uncommitted lines of credit will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated capital requirements and debt and other obligations as they come due 
on october   our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the acquired shares may be used for corporate purposes  including stock option awards and shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plans 
as of december    shares had been repurchased for approximately million 
the source of the funds for these purchases was internally generated 
on january   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock 
the additional authorization has the same provisions as the initial authorization with respect to how and when we can repurchase our common stock 
looking ahead during the year ending december   we intend to carry on our strategic plan to grow our asset management business 
we plan to continue to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the high net worth market by utilizing our expanded national sales force and by aggressively pursuing additional investment management teams 
in addition to adding investment management teams  we will continue to evaluate  where appropriate  strategic acquisitions of  or joint ventures with  companies that would add new product and services offerings  investment capabilities or distribution channels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our risk management policies and procedures have been established to identify  monitor and manage risk continuously 
the major types of risk that we face include credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations 
in order to mitigate risk  our policy is to monitor the credit standing of our clients and maintain collateral to support margin loans to our clients 
a significant portion of our revenues is based upon the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  or client withdrawals of assets under management  may cause our revenues and income to decline 
interest rate risk is the possibility of a loss in the value of financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
our primary exposure to interest rate risk arises from our interest earning assets mainly securities purchased under agreements to resell and receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and funding sources bank loans  subordinated liabilities and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations 
equity price risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of absolute and relative price movements  price volatility or changes in liquidity  over which we have no control 
our market making activities expose our capital to potential equity price risk 
to mitigate this risk  we impose strict investment limits on both the trading desk and individual traders 
moreover  our monthly average net long position for our market making activities was million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december
