the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on january  this new accounting standard requires companies to carry all derivative instruments  including certain embedded derivatives  in the statement of financial condition at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
the company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain liabilities 
this is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap or treasury lock collar 
for financial reporting purposes  the gain or loss on the effective portion of the interest rate hedge is recorded as a component of equity  which becomes reclassified into earnings along with payments on the hedged liability 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in january  the company recorded a net transition adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income and either an unrealized gain or loss on hedges at that time which did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations

funds from operations the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and statements of funds from operations amounts in thousands  except per share and op unit amounts year year year ended ended ended net income    adjustments allocation to minority interests operating partnership    depreciation on real estate assets    extraordinary items  loss on investment in technology segment  net gain on sales of real estate    ffo before preferred distributions    preferred distributions    ffo available to common shares and op units basic    ffo available to common shares and op units diluted    ffo per share and op unit basic ffo per share and op unit diluted weighted average common shares and op units outstanding basic    weighted average common shares and op units outstanding diluted    includes   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the company s share of depreciation from unconsolidated properties 
excludes  for the year ended december  related to the minority interests share of depreciation from partially owned properties 
represents the company s portion of losses related to its investment in broadband residential  inc 
these expenses have been added back to operations for the determination of ffo 
the effect of including this expense in ffo would be for the year ended december  for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and extraordinary items 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit recommended definition 
nareit modified this definition effective january  nevertheless  this modification had no impact upon the company s calculation of ffo for either the current or prior periods presented 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies and may differ as a result of differences between the company s and other real estate company s accounting policies for replacement type items and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s future earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating properties  financing activities and investing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions and other cash requirements 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company has total outstanding debt of approximately billion at december   of which approximately million  or is floating rate debt  including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements 
if market rates of interest on the company s floating rate debt increase by basis points a increase  the increase in interest expense on the company s floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on the company s floating rate debt decrease by basis points a decrease  the decrease in interest expense on the company s floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates and equity prices on the company s financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
