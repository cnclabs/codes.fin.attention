item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company s primary business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits and other borrowed funds in loans  mortgage backed securities  us government securities and other securities 
the company originates commercial  consumer  and mortgage loans for investment  and mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market 
mortgage loan sales are made from mortgage loans held in the company s portfolio designated as being held for sale or originated for sale during the period 
the company s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans  and to a lesser extent  dividends and interest on its investments and mortgage backed securities  fees and loan servicing income 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
the company s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and non interest income including loan sale activities  loan servicing income  and revenue from the trust company and agency operations 
the company s non interest expense consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  federal deposit insurance premiums  advertising and business promotion  data processing expense  and other expenses 
results of operations of the company are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities

results of operations overview net income for the year ended march  was million  or diluted earnings per share eps  compared to million  or diluted eps for the year ended march  and million  or diluted eps for the year ended march  pre tax income increased million  or  to million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  the net result of increases in net interest income of million  non interest income of million and non interest expense of million 
pre tax income increased  or  to million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  the net result of a million increase in net interest income  a million decrease in non interest income  and a  increase in non interest expense 
growth in eps was caused by the growth in net income and a reduction in outstanding shares of the company s stock primarily as a result of stock repurchases 
net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   following an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended march  the net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march   following an increase of basis points from for the year ended march   while the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march   following an decrease of five basis points from for the year ended march  net interest income before provision for loan losses represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income before provision for loan losses also depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on each 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company at fiscal year end and for fiscal years  and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from the best available daily or monthly data  which management believes approximates the average balances computed on a daily basis

the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated on a proportional basis between changes in rate and volume

to the extent the company experiences further increases in the overall balance of its loan portfolio or increases its concentrations of loans which bear a higher degree of risk than one to four family loans  the company anticipates further increases in its allowance for loan losses through continued provisions for loan losses 
while management of the company believes that the current level of its allowance for loan losses is sufficient based on information currently available at this time  no assurances can be made that future events  conditions or regulatory directives will not result in increased provisions for loan losses or additions to the company s allowance for loan losses which may adversely affect net income

non interest income non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   following a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended march  the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to an increase of million in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans  net  and increases in trust fee income of million  insurance commission income of  and service charges on deposit accounts of  partially offset by decreases in loan servicing income of  and other non interest income of  the improvement in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans reflected more favorable secondary market conditions  partially offset by a decrease in the origination of saleable fixed rate mortgages  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in trust fee income was due to the first full year of operations of the trust company  which opened in february the increase in insurance commission income was due primarily to additional business resulting from the purchase of two insurance agencies by the agency in march the decrease in loan servicing income was due primarily to a decline in the company s loans serviced for others during fiscal year  and a  reduction in the valuation reserve for mortgage servicing rights during fiscal year the decreases in other non interest income were due primarily to reductions in the fair value of investments in certain employee benefit plans 
the decrease during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to a million decrease in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans  net  partially offset by a  increase of earnings on boli  a  increase in service charges  a  increase in the unrealized gain loss on trading securities  and a  increase in insurance commissions 
the decrease in gain loss on sale of mortgage loans is due to lower volume of saleable mortgages and unfavorable secondary market conditions during fiscal year non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march   following an increase of  or  from million for year ended march  the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits of million  office occupancy and equipment of  and data processing of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in advertising and business promotion of  deposit insurance premiums of  and other non interest expense of  the higher overall level of expenses reflected costs associated with the company s new retail banking and business banking offices in downtown providence  rhode island  both of which opened in early fiscal year  the expansion of agency operations  the first full year of trust company operations  and the net impact of increases in the cost of certain employee benefit plans 
the increase during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to a  increase in compensation and benefits  a  increase in office occupancy and equipment  a  increase in advertising and business promotion due to the introduction of online banking  and a  increase in data processing due to increased online processing charges 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in deposit insurance premiums and a  decrease in other non interest expense 
the decrease in other non interest expense was primarily the result of lower costs for telephone  postage  and supplies due to decreased loan origination activity 
income taxes income tax expense increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   following a decrease of  or  from million for the year ended march  these changes were due primarily to the changes in pre tax income  and the company s implementation of certain tax strategies during the year ended march  overall  the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended march   compared to for the year ended march  and for the year ended march  financial condition overview total assets were billion at march   an increase of million  or  from billion at march   following an increase of million  or  from billion at march  the growth during fiscal year was primarily attributable to increases in loans receivable  net of million and mortgage loans held for sale of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in mortgage backed securities available for sale 
balance sheet growth was primarily funded by increases of million in deposit balances and million in fhlb advances and other borrowings during fiscal year the growth during fiscal year was primarily attributable to increases in mortgage backed securities available for sale of million and loans receivable  net of million  partially offset by decreases in mortgage loans held for sale of million and cash and cash equivalents of million

the decline during fiscal year was primarily attributable to two stock repurchase programs  the payment of four quarterly dividends to shareholders  and a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale  net of tax

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company s most liquid assets are cash  short term investments  mortgage loans held for sale  investments in trading securities  investment securities available for sale  and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash  short term investments  mortgage loans held for sale  investments in trading securities  investment securities available for sale  and mortgage backed securities available for sale totaled million  or of total assets 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including a million fhlb secured line of credit  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
at march   the company had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and other borrowings  and an additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million including a million line of credit 
during year end  the company used fhlb advances and other borrowings to fund asset growth  along with an increase in deposits  and may continue to do so in the future  depending on market conditions  the pricing of deposit products  and the pricing of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
at march   the company had commitments to originate loans and unused outstanding lines of credit and undistributed balances of construction loans totaling million 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate of deposit accounts scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
the company expects that it will retain a majority of maturing certificate accounts 
the company plans to open a new banking office in middletown  rhode island in the latter part of fiscal year  bringing total banking offices to sixteen 
the company continues to consider sites for new banking offices and loan origination centers in or adjacent to its market area 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  consider expanding its market share and or market area through the acquisition of assets or other banking institutions and may consider acquisitions of other types of financial services companies 
the company completed its sixth stock repurchase program and initiated its seventh stock repurchase program in fiscal year  which reduced outstanding legal shares in the company to  from the  shares originally issued 
the company also paid one dividend and three dividends to stockholders during the fiscal year the establishment of additional banking offices  loan origination centers  trust service operations  mergers and acquisitions  and additional capital management strategies by the company would result in additional capital expenditures and other associated costs which the company has not yet estimated

the liquidation account will be reduced to the extent that such account holders reduce their qualifying deposits 
in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the bank  each such account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account 
the bank is not permitted to declare or pay dividends on its capital stock  or repurchase any of its outstanding stock  if the effect thereof would cause its stockholders equity to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account or applicable regulatory capital requirements 
the balance of the liquidation account at march  was approximately million 
market risk and management of interest rate risk the principal market risk affecting the company is interest rate risk 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board of directors approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the company s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets on a monthly basis and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company has primarily utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate and shorter term generally ten years or less fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans  selling in the secondary market longer term  fixed rate mortgage loans originated while generally retaining the servicing rights on such loans  and investing primarily in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and short term fixed rate cmos 
in addition  the company engaged in two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional principal amount of million to synthetically lengthen its liability maturities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at march   the company s cumulative one year interest rate gap the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year as a percentage of total assets was a positive 
accordingly  during a period of falling interest rates  the company s interest earning assets would be expected to reprice downward at a faster rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which  consequently  may negatively affect the company s net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  the company s interest earning assets would be expected to reprice upward at a faster rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which  consequently  may positively affect the company s net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at march  which  based upon certain assumptions  are anticipated by the company to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at march   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of maturities  contractual amortization  and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
annual market prepayment rates for one to four family and multi family mortgage loans  and mortgage backed securities are assumed to range from to for adjustable rates and to for fixed rates  respectively 
cofi floating rate cmos and adjustable rate mbs are assumed to fully reprice over a two year period based on projected index changes and principal repayments under a constant interest rate scenario 
money market deposit accounts and negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts are assumed to reprice evenly over a three year period  while regular savings accounts are viewed as composed of two equally weighted components a longer term core deposit that reprices evenly over a thirty year term  and a more active secondary tier that reprices evenly over three years 
in the money putable fhlb advances where the company is short the put option were repriced at their put dates while out of the money putable fhlb advances were repriced at their contractual maturities 
these assumptions may or may not be indicative of actual prepayment and withdrawals experienced by the company 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the actual repricing dates of various assets and liabilities are subject to customer discretion and competitive and other pressures and  therefore  actual experience may vary from that indicated 
the following table shows the estimated gap position of the company at march  more than more than more than more than more months months to months to year to years to than total or less months year years years years amount dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments investment securities   loans receivable        mortgage backed securities        stock in fhlb boston   total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities money market accounts      savings accounts        now accounts      certificate accounts       ira and keogh accounts       fhlb advances and other borrowings        total interest bearing liabilities        interest rate swaps pay fixed    receive floating    interest rate gap after swaps        cumulative interest rate gap       cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at march  cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets at march  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities at march  cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at march  cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets at march  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities at march  includes total loans receivable and mortgage loans held for sale including non performing loans  net of deferred loan origination costs  undisbursed proceeds of construction mortgages in process  and allowance for loan losses 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which generates estimates of the change in the company s net interest income nii and net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the estimated market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots produces a similar analysis for the bank using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report  the results of which may vary from the company s internal model primarily due to differences in assumptions utilized between the company s internal model and the ots model  including estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit renewal rates 
the following table sets forth the company s estimated npv and npv ratios as of march  and  as calculated by the company 
march  march  change in estimated npv estimated npv interest rates net sensitivity net sensitivity in basis portfolio npv board in basis portfolio npv in basis points value ratio limits points value ratio points dollars in thousands unchanged   as in the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented incorporates an assumption that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured  and that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the term to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to  and do not  provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income 
during fiscal year end  the company continued to follow its practice of selling certain fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans while generally retaining the servicing rights of such loans 
in conjunction with this mortgage banking activity  the company uses forward contracts in order to reduce exposure to interest rate risk 
the amount of forward coverage of the pipeline of mortgages is managed on a day to day basis by an operating officer  within board approved policy guidelines  based on the company s assessment of the general direction of interest rates and levels of mortgage origination activity 
asset quality delinquencies and classified assets 
reports listing all delinquent accounts are generated and reviewed by management on a monthly basis and the board of directors performs a monthly review of all loans or lending relationships delinquent days or more and all real estate owned reo 
the procedures taken by the company with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan  term and cause of delinquency and whether the borrower is habitually delinquent 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the company takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
the company generally sends the borrower a written notice of non payment after the loan is first past due 
the company s guidelines provide that telephone  written correspondence and or face to face contact will be attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of repayment 
when contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure  the company will attempt to obtain full payment  offer to provide budget and finance counseling services  work out a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure or  in some instances  accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
in the event payment is not then received or the loan is not otherwise satisfied  additional letters and telephone calls are generally made 
if the loan is still not brought current or satisfied and it becomes necessary for the company to take legal action  which typically occurs after a loan is days or more delinquent  the company will commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure and  if purchased by the company  becomes reo 
federal regulations and the company s credit risk review policy require that the company utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
the company has incorporated the ots internal asset classifications as a part of its credit monitoring system 
the company currently classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the credit weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
when an insured institution classifies one or more assets  or portions thereof  as substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish a general valuation allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies one or more assets  or portions thereof  as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and that management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
although management believes that  based on information currently available to it at this time  its allowance for loan losses is adequate  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary 
the company s credit risk review committee reviews and classifies the company s assets on a quarterly basis and the board of directors reviews the reports on a quarterly basis 
the company classifies assets in accordance with the management guidelines described above 
at march   the company had million of loans designated as substandard 
as of march   the company had loans totaling million designated as special mention 
these loans are designated as special mention because of inherent weaknesses that currently exist  but might be correctable in a twelve month cycle 
accordingly  they require additional monitoring

impaired loans 
impaired loans are commercial and commercial real estate loans for which it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the definition of impaired loans is not the same as the definition of non accrual loans  although the two categories overlap 
non accrual loans include impaired loans and are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when collectibility of principal or interest is uncertain or payments of principal or interest have been contractually past due days 
the company may choose to place a loan on non accrual status due to payment delinquency or uncertain collectibility  while not classifying the loan as impaired  if i it is probable that the company will collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or ii the loan is not a commercial or a commercial real estate loan 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value 
the amount of impairment for these types of impaired loans is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan  using the original contractual interest rate  and its recorded value  or  in the case of collateralized loans  the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loan 
when foreclosure is probable  impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
residential mortgage and consumer loans are measured for impairment collectively 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and insignificant shortfalls in payment amounts generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed

during fiscal year end  the average recorded value of impaired loans was  for these loans   of interest income was recognized while  of interest income would have been recognized under the original terms 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance is based on management s ongoing review of the existing loan portfolio and current market conditions  as well as the volume and mix of new originations 
management s methodology to estimate loss exposure inherent in the portfolio also includes analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired  allowance allocations for various loan types based on payment status or loss experience  and an unallocated allowance that is maintained based on management s assessment of many factors including trends in loan delinquencies and charge offs  current type  mix and balance of the portfolio  performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms  and the perceived risk in the relatively new and rapidly growing commercial loan portfolio 
in addition  the ots and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
as of march   the company s allowance for loan losses was of total loans receivable and of total non performing loans as compared to and  respectively  as of march  non accrual loans totaled million at both march  and march  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at march  as compared to million at march  the increase in the allowance of  reflects management s assessment of the loan portfolio and was based upon the growth of higher credit risk components of the portfolio 
the company will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as conditions dictate 
while management believes the company s allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio at march   no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses
