oil prices began to improve in the first half of after reaching a decade low of in the fourth quarter of the eight quarters since then have resulted in sequential increases reaching an average high of per barrel in the fourth quarter of the recent recovery in oil prices is primarily the result of an increase in worldwide energy consumption and an agreement between certain major oil producers to limit worldwide oil production 
there can be no assurances that these producers will comply with the self imposed limitations on oil production  or that the improvement in oil prices will stabilize or continue 
the improvement in oil and gas prices has resulted in a worldwide increase in rig activity of in  with a substantial portion of the improvement in north america us and canada 
the international market  which has languished behind the recovery in north america  was up in rig activity in international rig activity was significantly up in the second half of the year up over the first half as latin america  europe  and the far east all showed significant improvement 
the improved oil and gas prices and related increase in rig activity had a significant impact on the company s results of operations as operating profit excluding transaction costs and write offs was up in compared to  increasing from million to million 
the increase in activity favorably impacted the company s services oriented businesses  as tubular services and drilling services revenue increased and in over  respectively 
in addition  the company s drilling equipment sales group reported an increase in new orders of in over  and was recently awarded a million dollar rig order from maersk hyundai heavy industries for the construction of a new harsh environment jack up rig

factors affecting future operating results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  the capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  the level of pipeline construction and maintenance expenditures  and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the prevailing and expected market prices for oil and natural gas 
such prices are impacted by  among other factors  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production of non opec countries  worldwide demand for oil and gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  availability of new leases and concessions  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
no assurance can be given as to the level of future oil and gas industry activity or demand for the company s services and products 
the company s foreign operations  which include significant operations in canada  europe  the far east  the middle east and latin america  are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the company operates have adopted policies or are subject to governmental policies giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of such policies  the company relies on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the company and such government owned petroleum companies 
although the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from nationalistic policies  political instability  economic instability or currency restrictions  there can be no assurance that such a problem will not arise in the future 
the company s solids control  inspection and coating services routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes 
the company is subject to numerous local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the containment and disposal of materials  pursuant to which the company has been required to incur compliance and clean up costs  which were not substantial in   and compliance with environmental laws and regulations due to currently unknown circumstances or developments  however  could result in substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s recent growth in revenues and profitability has been the result of its aggressive acquisition program 
the company s future operating results will be impacted by the company s ability to identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities  consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company has historically managed its exposure to interest changes by using a combination of fixed rate debt  variable rate debt  interest swap and collar agreements in its total debt portfolio 
as of december   the company had no interest rate swap or collar agreements outstanding 
at december   the company had million of outstanding debt 
fixed rate debt included million of senior notes net of discounts at a fixed interest rate of 
with respect to foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses natural hedges to minimize the effect of rate fluctuations 
when natural hedges are not sufficient  generally it is the company s policy to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant transactions for periods consistent with the underlying risk 
the company had no forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes
