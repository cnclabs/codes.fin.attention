overview in  bronner slosberg humphrey co 
was formed to provide direct marketing and promotion services 
in  strategic interactive group  an internet professional services firm  was formed to provide end to end internet business solutions to corporate clients 
between and  strategic interactive group and bronner slosberg humphrey co 
operated as two separate entities under common control 
by january  strategic interactive group had grown so large and the two companies had become so interrelated that the two businesses were merged into a single entity following a recapitalization by a private equity investor and several of our existing shareholders 
the purpose of the recapitalization was to combine the entities  realign the ownership of the combined entities with those senior employees who would most actively lead our future growth  establish an equity based incentive program to motivate our current and future employees and enhance our ability to make strategic investments in our people and services 
as a result of a reorganization transaction implemented in connection with our initial public offering in march  digitas inc became the holding company 
business operations our revenue is generated from providing professional services to our clients 
we expect that our revenue will continue to be driven primarily by the number and scope of our client engagements 
we focus on large scale  long term  strategic relationships with a select group of clients 
for  our three largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenue and our largest client accounted for approximately of our revenue 
historically  we have offered our services to clients primarily on a time and materials basis 
for these engagements  we recognize revenue as services are provided based on actual costs incurred 
as our client relationships have grown  we have increasingly entered into broad contracts under which we deliver our services based on mutually agreed upon scopes of work 
these contracts generally include estimates on total fees that clients will be charged for the year 
for these contracts  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
additionally  some of our contracts include a discretionary bonus provision whereby we get additional compensation based on our performance as evaluated by our clients 
we recognize bonus revenue in the period we are informed that the bonus has been awarded 
most of our contracts allow us to invoice our clients on a pro rata basis for our services 
we incur significant reimbursable costs  such as on line media buying and production costs  on behalf of our clients 
in accordance with the client agreements  there is not a markup on reimbursable costs and the client s approval is required prior to digitas incurring them 
revenue does not include reimbursable costs 
professional services costs consist of professional salaries  payroll taxes and benefits for our professional staff plus other non reimbursable costs directly attributable to servicing our clients 
in addition to the compensation of employees engaged in the delivery of professional services  professional salaries include compensation for selling and management by our senior account managers and most of our executives 
we expect that per capita professional services costs will increase over time due primarily to wage increases 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of administrative and executive compensation  recruiting  professional fees  rent and office expenses 
in  we expect to continue to make significant expenditures for recruiting and training as we continue to expand our operations 
we have incurred significant costs to expand our operations internationally 
we believe that a key source of our growth will be servicing existing clients on a worldwide basis  as well as attracting new clients in international markets 
stock based compensation before the recapitalization consisted of annual distributions and increases in the value of stock appreciation rights resulting from the pending acquisition of the company 
stock based compensation after the recapitalization consisted primarily of non cash compensation arising from stock options granted to employees at exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock  the repurchase of stock options from an employee and shares of common stock sold to members of the board of directors at a price below the estimated fair value 
in connection with the recapitalization we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
this amount  which represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired  is being amortized over two to seven years 
we were taxed as an s corporation until january when we terminated our s corporation election and became subject to federal taxation 
no provision or liability for federal taxes is reflected for periods prior to for the periods prior to  we have recorded provisions  tax assets and liabilities for massachusetts and various states where we do business that have a limited state corporate income and excise tax

revenue for increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase was due to growth in revenue from new clients of approximately and existing clients of approximately 
this increase in revenue was due to an increase in demand for results oriented marketing and technology related services

other expense  net  for consisted primarily of interest expense on our long term borrowings related to the recapitalization in january provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for increased by million to million from million for the effective income tax rate is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates due primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets

risks factors and important factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this form k 
this form k contains forward looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements on page one 
risks related to our business the loss of even one significant client or any significant reduction in the use of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we derive a significant portion of our revenues from large scale engagements for a limited number of clients 
most of these relationships  including that with our largest client  are terminable by the client without penalty on days prior written notice 
our relationships with our second and third largest clients are terminable without prior notice 
the loss of any major client or any significant reduction in the use of our services could dramatically reduce our revenues 
for  our three largest clients  american express  general motors and morgan stanley  collectively accounted for approximately of our revenues  and our largest client  american express  accounted for approximately of our revenues 
the loss of any of these clients or any significant reduction in the use of our services could significantly reduce our revenue and have a negative impact on our operating results and reputation in our market 
our failure to meet our clients expectations could result in negative publicity and losses and could subject us to liability for the services we provide the average dollar amount of our client engagements has grown significantly while the time frame for delivering our services has generally decreased 
as clients have dedicated more money and resources to our engagements with them  their expectations have also increased 
as our client engagements become larger and more complex and are required to be completed in a shorter time frame  we face increased management challenges and greater risk of mistakes 
many of the services we provide are critical to the operations of our clients businesses 
any failure on our part to deliver these services in accordance with our clients expectations could result in o additional expenditures to correct the problem  o adverse client reactions  o negative publicity  o delayed or lost client revenues  and o claims against us 
while our agreements with clients often limit our liability to damages arising from our rendering of services  we cannot assure you that these provisions will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability 
although we carry general liability insurance coverage  our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
failure to manage our growth may impact our operating results we expect to continue to rapidly grow our business 
the expansion of our business and customer base has placed  and will continue to place  increased demands on our management  operating systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
if not managed effectively  these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to our existing clients 
in addition  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations 
consequently  in order to manage our growth effectively  we may be required to increase expenditures to expand  train and manage our employee base  improve our management  financial and information systems and controls  or make other capital expenditures 
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting  forecasting and other process control issues presented by rapid expansion 
if we are not successful in creating a worldwide network of offices  we may jeopardize our relationships with existing clients and limit our ability to attract new clients increasingly  our clients are insisting that their customer solution service providers be able to handle assignments on a worldwide basis 
failure to grow and scale a worldwide network of offices may jeopardize our existing client relationships and limit our ability to attract new clients 
currently  we possess london  brussels  hong kong and miami offices to serve the european  asian and latin american markets 
in addition  we also need to deepen and broaden our expertise in dealing with worldwide assignments by hiring more senior executives with multi national technology  marketing and customer relationship management expertise 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may result in a reduction in our revenues and operating results our ability to succeed depends on the continued investment of our current and future clients in the services we offer 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may cause some of our current and future clients to reduce or eliminate their budgets for our services 
furthermore  the reduction in client budgets may intensify competition and further increase pressure for us to reduce the fees we charge our clients 
an economic recession or downturn in the united states or abroad may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to reduced prices for our stock our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
however  if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following o variability in market demand for our services  o timing and amount of client bonus payments  o length of the sales cycle associated with our service offerings  o unanticipated variations in the size  budget  number or progress toward completion of our engagements  o unanticipated termination of a major engagement  a client s decision not to proceed with an engagement we anticipated or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major client engagements  o efficiency with which we utilize our employees  including our ability to transition employees from completed engagements to new engagements  o our ability to manage our operating costs  a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter  o changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  o timing and cost of new office expansions  o our ability to manage future growth  and o costs of attracting and training skilled personnel 
some of these factors are within our control while others are outside of our control 
our planned international operations may be expensive and may not succeed we have expanded and expect to continue to expand our international operations 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our services outside of north america and the united kingdom 
development of such skills may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  especially due to language barriers  cultural differences  currency exchange risks and the fact that the internet infrastructure in foreign countries may be less advanced than in the united states 
in addition  we will have to attract and retain experienced management and employees  and we may be unable to do so 
moreover  international operations are subject to a variety of additional risks that could seriously harm our financial condition and operating results 
these risks include the following o the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  o political and economic instability  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  o the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws and regulations  o currency issues  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o the conversion to the euro by all countries of the european union by year end  o tariffs  trade barriers and other import and export restrictions including restrictions on the import and export of sensitive technologies  and o seasonal reductions in business activity in parts of the world  such as during the summer months in europe 
we must maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition to remain competitive we believe that establishing and maintaining name recognition and a good reputation is critical to attracting and expanding our targeted client base as well as attracting and retaining qualified employees 
we also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase due to the growing number of services providers in our industry 
if our reputation is damaged or if we are unable to establish name recognition  we may become less competitive or lose our market share 
in addition  our name could be associated with any business difficulties of our clients 
as a result  the difficulties or failure of one of our clients could damage our reputation and name and make it difficult for us to compete for new business 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel  including david kenny and michael ward 
this dependence is particularly important to our business because personal relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
in addition  if any of our key personnel join a competitor or form a competing company  some of our clients might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
furthermore  other companies seeking to develop in house business capabilities may hire away some of our key personnel 
our business will be negatively affected if we do not keep up with rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and changing client requirements our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and changing client needs 
accordingly  our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner 
among the most important challenges facing us is the need to o effectively use leading technologies  o continue to develop our strategic and technical expertise  o influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  o enhance our current service offerings  and o develop new services that meet changing customer needs 
our success depends on increased adoption of new technologies as a means of conducting business our future success depends heavily on the acceptance and use of new technologies as a means for conducting business 
if e commerce does not continue to grow  or grows more slowly than expected  our growth would decline and our business would be seriously harmed 
customers and businesses may reject e commerce for a number of reasons  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o delays in the development of enabling technologies and performance improvements  o delays in the development of security and authentication technology necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information  and o failure of companies to meet their customers expectations in delivering goods and services via e commerce 
our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  if we cannot effectively compete  our revenue may decline our industry is relatively new and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify even further as our industry evolves 
some of our competitors have more clients  greater brand or name recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements 
they may also develop and promote their products and services more effectively than we do 
there are relatively low barriers to entry into our industry 
in addition  we have no patented technology and limited other proprietary rights that would preclude or inhibit competitors from providing services similar to ours 
as a result  new and unknown market entrants pose a threat to our business 
current or future competitors may also develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price  which could affect our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish corporate relationships among themselves or other third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or any new competitors 
actual and perceived conflicts of interest may restrict us in obtaining new clients actual and perceived conflicts of interest are inherent in our industry 
we sometimes decline to accept potential clients because of actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our existing clients 
in addition  potential clients may choose not to retain us for reasons of actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
many of our clients compete in industries where only a limited number of companies gain meaningful market share 
as a result  if we decide not to perform services for a particular client s competitors  or if potential clients choose not to retain us because of actual or perceived conflicts and our client fails to capture a significant portion of its market  we are unlikely to receive future revenue in that particular industry 
potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  adversely affect our operating results and dilute shareholder value we may acquire other businesses in the future  which may complicate our management tasks 
we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to do so could result in our inability to retain the management  key personnel  employees and clients of the acquired business 
such integration efforts also may distract our management from servicing existing clients 
our failure to manage future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our shareholders could be diluted if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available to us  and which may dilute the ownership interests of current investors we may need to raise additional funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to otherwise support our business and implement our strategy 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to o open new offices  o create additional market specific business units  o enhance our infrastructure  o hire  train and retain employees  o keep up with technological advances  o respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  or o pursue acquisition opportunities 
our failure to do any of these things could restrict our growth  hinder our ability to compete and seriously harm our financial condition 
additionally  if we are able to raise additional funds through equity financings  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
we have a history of reported net losses and there can be no assurance that we will soon report net income we have experienced substantial net losses for the three years ended december  these losses have been attributable to charges for stock based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets 
we expect to continue to report large charges for these items over the next five years under current accounting standards 
our anticipated revenue growth may not compensate for these charges and we may not achieve profitability during this time period 
risks related to the securities markets our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
since we completed our initial public offering in march  the market price for our common stock has been as high as per share and as low as per share 
additionally  the stock market in general  and the market for internet related stocks in particular  has been highly volatile and has been characterized by significant decreases in market prices during the latter portion of this volatility often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to o our perceived prospects  o variations in our operating results and our achievement of key business targets  o changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates  o differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  o announcements of new contracts or service offerings by us or our competitors  o market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors  and o general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters as of march   our executive officers  directors and shareholders collectively owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these shareholders have the power to control the election of our directors  and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of our shareholders  including any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  without the consent of these shareholders  we cannot enter into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other shareholders 
also  third parties could be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire digitas at a price per share that is above the then current market price 
risks related to legal uncertainty we may be subject to lawsuits as a result of our attempts to hire qualified people some companies have adopted a strategy of suing or threatening to sue former employees and their new employers 
as we hire new employees from our current or potential competitors we may become a party to one or more lawsuits involving the former employment of one of our employees 
any future litigation against us or our employees  regardless of the outcome  may result in substantial costs and expenses to us and may divert management s attention away from the operation of our business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
if any party asserts a claim against us relating to proprietary technology or information  we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states so  as our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
changes in government regulation of the internet and other emerging technologies could adversely affect our business to date  government regulations have not materially restricted the use of the internet and other emerging technologies by our clients in their markets 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to such technologies may change 
new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impact us directly or indirectly by preventing our clients from delivering products or services over technology based distribution channels 
new state  federal and foreign laws and regulations may be adopted regarding any of the following issues o user privacy  o the pricing and taxation of goods and services offered over the internet  o the content of web sites  o consumer protection  and o the characteristics and quality of products and services offered 
any new legislation could inhibit the increased use of the internet and emerging technologies as commercial mediums which in turn would decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance 
we may become subject to claims regarding foreign laws and regulations that could subject us to increased expenses because we plan to expand our international operations and because many of our current clients have international operations  we may be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions for violations of their laws 
these laws may change  or new  more restrictive laws may be enacted in the future 
international litigation is often expensive and time consuming and could distract our management s attention away from the operation of our business 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and by laws may make a takeover more difficult provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt which is opposed by our management and board of directors 
public shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
in our certificate of incorporation we also have a staggered board of directors which makes it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public shareholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors
