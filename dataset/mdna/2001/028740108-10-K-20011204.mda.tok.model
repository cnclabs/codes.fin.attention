in addition  the company produces and sells sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generant used in automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron tm  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
the perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron tm facilities are located on the company s property in southern utah and the chemicals produced and sold at these facilities collectively represent the company s specialty chemicals operating segment 
the company s other lines of business include the development of real estate in nevada and the production of environmental protection equipment  including waste water and seawater treatment systems 
upon consummation of the acquisition in  the company effectively became the sole north american producer of ap 
sales and operating revenues 
sales of the company s perchlorate chemical products  consisting almost entirely of ap sales  accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in general  demand for ap is driven by a relatively small number of dod and nasa contractors 
as a result  any one individual ap customer usually accounts for a significant portion of the revenues of the company 
for example  alliant accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
sodium azide sales accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
autoliv  the company s principal sodium azide customer  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of halotron tm amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in fiscal  sales of halotron tm increased approximately as compared to fiscal  continuing its recent growth pattern 
halotron tm is designed to replace halon based fire extinguishing systems 
accordingly  demand for halotron tm depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of consumers to switch from halon based systems  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations 
real estate and related sales amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that the company is unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales or recognition of the equity in earnings of real estate ventures 
environmental protection equipment sales accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
cost of sales 
the principal elements comprising the company s cost of sales are depreciation and amortization  raw materials  electric power  labor  manufacturing overhead and the basis in real estate sold 
the major raw materials used by the company in its production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  nitrous oxide and hcfc significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if the company is unable to pass along such increases to its customers 
during the first six months of fiscal  the company purchased greater quantities of certain raw materials because of excessive power costs see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
prices paid by the company for raw materials have historically been relatively stable  although the company has recently experienced cost increases on certain raw materials  particularly on hcfc and those requiring substantial energy costs to produce 
all the raw materials used in the company s manufacturing processes have been available in commercial quantities  and the company has had no difficulty obtaining necessary raw materials 
a substantial portion of the total cash costs of operating the company s specialty chemical plants  consisting mostly of labor and overhead  are largely fixed in nature 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
operating expenses in the fiscal years  and include approximately million  million and million  respectively  in costs related to the investigation and evaluation of the trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company is unable to determine the extent to which similar costs will be incurred in the future 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were approximately and during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company established a deferred tax valuation allowance 
in fiscal  the company released its deferred tax valuation allowance and recognized approximately million in net deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
net income 
although the company s net income and diluted net income per common share have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others i as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company  the company may incur material legal and other costs associated with certain litigation and contingencies  ii the timing of real estate sales and equity in the earnings of real estate ventures is not predictable  iii the recognition of revenues from environmental protection equipment orders not accounted for as long term contracts depends upon orders generated and the timing of shipment of the equipment  iv weighted average common and common equivalent shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income loss per common share are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the market price of the company s common stock due to outstanding warrants and options  v the results of periodic reviews of impairment issues  vi the ability to pass on increases in raw material costs  including electric power costs  to customers  and vii the magnitude  pricing and timing of ap  sodium azide  halotron tm  and environmental protection equipment sales in the future is uncertain 
see forward looking statements risk factors below 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  sales and operating revenues 
sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was principally attributable to lower specialty chemicals sales 
perchlorate chemical and sodium azide sales decreased approximately million due to lower volumes 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in halotron tm sales of approximately million 
the increase in halotron tm sales results principally from the company s increased penetration into the clean gas fire extinguishing markets both domestically and internationally 
in march  the company received notification from thiokol of a change in the fiscal purchase order for ap that resulted in a decrease of approximately million pounds of ap from million pounds of ap 
the company submitted a price adjustment claim under the change order and  in september  negotiated and settled the claim which resulted in a million payment from thiokol 
sales volume levels for ap declined from approximately million pounds in fiscal to approximately million pounds in fiscal ap sales volumes in fiscal were approximately million pounds 
the recent weakness in sales volumes is primarily attributable to lower requirements for applications in certain commercial space launch vehicles used primarily in satellite launches  particularly telecommunication satellites 
in addition  purchases of ap for use in the solid rocket motors for the space shuttle  as evidenced by the change order referred to above  have declined as a result of existing excess inventory levels 
the company believes that such excess should be reduced over the next few years considering the number of shuttle flights planned for the construction and servicing of the international space station 
the company also understands that existing plans call for significant ap requirements over the next several years for use in the minuteman program 
although the company has not yet experienced a specific increase in defense related orders  the tragic events on september   in new york city and washington dc and the united states of america s declared war on terrorism  may result in increased orders for ap used in certain defense programs 
accordingly  the company estimates that the north american demand for ap could increase to an annual level of between million and million pounds over the next few years  although there can be no assurance given with respect to these estimates 
the company has no ability to influence north american demand for ap 
the company experienced a decrease in sodium azide sales volumes in fiscal as compared to fiscal although the company expects the worldwide demand for airbag systems to increase  the level of demand for sodium azide will depend upon the penetration of competing inflator technologies that are not based upon the use of sodium azide 
based principally upon market information received from inflator manufacturers  the company expects sodium azide use to continue to decline and that inflators using sodium azide will be phased out over some period of time 
real estate sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to an increase in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as of october   this segment had no significant backlog  although the company is actively bidding on a number of projects 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales to sales was principally attributable to decreased depreciation expense associated with the company s sodium azide operations  as a result of the impairment charge in fiscal discussed below 
in addition  because of the settlement and curtailment arrangement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  net power costs were approximately million less in fiscal as compared to normalized historical annual amounts 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal operating expenses during the fiscal years ended and include approximately million and million  respectively  in costs associated with the investigation and evaluation of trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
segment operating income 
operating income of the company s operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the increases in operating income in the company s specialty chemicals industry segment was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of million recognized in fiscal the increase in operating income of the company s real estate segment was principally due to better margins on land sales 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to lower average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal principally as a result of lower average debt balances 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  sales and operating revenues 
sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to decreased specialty chemicals and real estate sales 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in environmental protection equipment sales 
specialty chemicals sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in perchlorate sales of million and a decrease in sodium azide sales of million 
the decrease in perchlorate sales was attributable to the reduced sales volumes discussed above 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in halotron tm sales 
halotron sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in halotron tm sales results principally from the company s increased penetration into the clean gas fire extinguishing agent market 
the company experienced a decrease in sodium azide sales volume in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due principally to the declining market usage referred to above 
as a result of these market conditions  in fiscal the company recognized an impairment charge of approximately million relating to fixed assets used in the production of sodium azide 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
real estate sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal due to a decrease in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to lower specialty chemical sales volumes perchlorates and sodium azide 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of the company s operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the decrease in operating income of the specialty chemicals segment was attributable to the decrease in perchlorate and sodium azide sales and the impairment charge of million discussed above 
the increase in operating income of the environmental protection equipment segment was primarily due to an increase in sales and an unusual charge recognized in fiscal in the amount of approximately million associated with certain warranty items 
the decrease in operating income of the real estate segment was attributable to a decrease in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in the increase was principally due to higher average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the company s repurchase of approximately million in principal amount of notes during fiscal inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  general inflation may have an effect on gross profit in the future as certain of the company s agreements with ap and sodium azide customers require fixed prices  although certain of such agreements contain escalation features that should somewhat insulate the company from increases in costs associated with inflation 
as discussed above  the company recently experienced significant increases in certain raw material costs and power costs  although the company believes that such increases are not specifically related to the effects of general inflation 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements of the company  in march  the company sold notes in the principal amount of million  acquired certain assets from kerr mcgee for a cash purchase price of million and paid million to repurchase the remaining million principal amount outstanding of the azide notes 
since the original issuance of the notes  the company has repurchased and retired approximately million in principal amount of notes and incurred extraordinary losses on these debt extinguishments of approximately million 
no notes were repurchased in fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of its operations  including debt related payments 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for ap  sodium azide and halotron tm  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate principally to specialty chemicals segment capital improvement projects 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during the three year period ended september   the company made debt related payments of approximately million  repurchased million in common stock and issued million in common stock as a result of the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the company may but it is not obligated to continue to repurchase its common stock but is limited in its ability to use cash to repurchase stock by certain covenants contained in the indenture governing the notes 
under the terms of the indenture  in december  the company expects to make an offer to purchase approximately million in principal amount of notes at  or at a cost of approximately million 
the offer will remain open for twenty business days 
during the three year period ended september   the company received cash of approximately million from its ventana canyon joint venture 
the company currently anticipates that cash returns of invested capital and equity in earnings will continue through the conclusion of the project  currently projected to be near the end of calendar as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company  the company has incurred legal and other costs  and it may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
any such costs  to the extent borne by the company and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company is currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs or the period of time over which such costs will be incurred
