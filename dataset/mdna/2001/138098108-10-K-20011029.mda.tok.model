during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar decreased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affects the company s results of operations because the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
such currency fluctuations also result in a corresponding change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in canadian dollars 
under the canadian revolving credit facility  carsen has a  united states dollars foreign currency hedging facility which is available to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on purchases of inventories 
at october   carsen had commitments for foreign currency forward contracts all of which are outstanding under the previous carsen credit facility aggregating  united states dollars  to hedge against possible declines in the value of the canadian dollar which would otherwise result in higher inventory costs 
such contracts represent a portion of the canadian subsidiary s projected purchases of inventories during october the weighted average exchange rate of the forward contracts open at october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
effective august   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges  and recognition of gains and losses is deferred within other comprehensive income until settlement of the underlying commitments 
realized gains and losses are recorded within cost of sales upon settlement 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on operations  however  it resulted in a  gain being recorded in other comprehensive income 
during fiscal  this entire gain of  was included in income 
additionally  the fair value of the company s derivatives was  at july   which resulted in the recording of an unrealized gain of  during fiscal for purposes of translating the balance sheet  at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar decreased by approximately compared to the value of the united states dollar 
as a result  at july   the negative cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment was increased by  to  compared to  at july   thereby further decreasing stockholders equity 
the company believes that its current cash position  anticipated cash flows from continuing operations and the funds available under the new revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon the current level of operations  including the operations of minntech

the valuation allowance related to the company s nols will be reversed in connection with the purchase price allocation for the minntech acquisition  based upon an assessment of the combined companies expected future results of operations 
in addition  the company and its canadian subsidiary cannot file consolidated tax returns  for canadian or united states income tax purposes 
therefore  the company s us nols cannot be utilized to reduce canadian federal or provincial income taxes payable by the canadian subsidiary on its taxable income 
this has resulted in the payment of income taxes by the company in canada  notwithstanding nol s utilized  or net losses sustained  by the company in the united states 
inflation has not significantly impacted the company s operations
