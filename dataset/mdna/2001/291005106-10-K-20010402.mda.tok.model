item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we completed our initial public offering and began our expansion strategy 
through  we focused on rapidly expanding our operations in order to assemble a portfolio of assisted living communities with a critical mass of capacity 
we pursued an aggressive acquisition and development strategy during that time  acquiring and developing communities in  acquiring and developing communities in  and developing communities in having achieved our initial growth objective  in and continuing in  we have substantially reduced our pace of acquisition and development activities to concentrate on improving community performance through both occupancy and revenue per occupied unit 
in  we focused our operational efforts on increasing occupancy 
during  average occupancy increased percentage points between and to an average occupancy of in our consolidated portfolio of buildings 
revenue per unit increased or per unit to  as of december  due to the success of our occupancy focus in  we shifted our operational concentration on improvement in revenue per unit in we implemented a rate enhancement program that yielded a increase or per unit to  in our consolidated portfolio over results 
additionally  we sacrificed less than percentage point in average occupancy to from in our total operated portfolio  comprised of all managed communities  experienced a similar improvement in revenue per unit 
our rate enhancement program yielded an increase of or per unit to  in our total operated portfolio over results 
additionally  our consolidated portfolio community operating margin defined as community revenues less community operations improved percentage points to in  compared to in additionally  we experienced an increase in average occupancy of to in from in and community operating margin for our total operated portfolio improved percentage points to in from in the following table presents a summary of our community interests

in november  we sold all our minority interest in alert care 
included in our consolidated portfolio of communities 
includes one community that we do not manage 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe generally that only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
inflation or other circumstances that adversely affect seniors ability to pay for assisted living services could therefore have an adverse effect on our business 
all sources of revenue other than residents private resources constitute less than of our total revenues 
we have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses resulted from a number of factors  including 
occupancy levels at our communities that were lower for longer periods than we originally anticipated  
financing costs that we incurred as a result of multiple financing and refinancing transactions  and 
administrative and corporate expenses that we increased to facilitate our growth 
during  we decided to reduce acquisition and development activities and dispose of select communities that had been operating at a loss 
we believe that slowing our acquisition and development activities has enabled us to use our resources more efficiently and increase our focus on enhancing community operations

total operating revenues increased million to million for from million in  representing a increase 
within total operating revenues  community revenue including other service fees increased million to million in from million in the first quarter of  however  includes approximately million of community revenue from communities known as the march communities  more fully discussed under meditrust transactions that were transferred at the end of the quarter to a related party investor group under agreements pursuant to which we continue to manage them 
accordingly  the first quarter of includes only management fees from these communities and no community revenue 
excluding the march communities  revenues increased million or from to  primarily as a result of a increase in revenue per unit an increase of per unit to  per unit at december  and the addition of six communities during  partially offset by the disposition of a skilled nursing facility 
management fee revenue decreased  to million in from million in in  we were not able to recognize fees earned from our management of communities known as the december communities  more fully discussed under meditrust transactions where the management agreements require us to fund cash operating deficits  while in we recognized million in management fee revenue from these communities 
this was partially offset by an increase of  in management fees from the march communities from million to million  the addition of several new management agreements and the generally improving performance of our portfolio of managed communities 
community operations 
community operating expenses decreased million to million for from for  representing a decrease 
as a percentage of total operating revenues  community operations decreased to for compared to for the first quarter of  however  includes approximately million of community operating expenses from the march communities  with no comparable offset in excluding the march communities  community operating expenses increased million or from to  primarily as a result of the addition of six new buildings to our consolidated portfolio  slightly offset by the disposition of one skilled nursing facility 
excluding the march communities  our operating margin  which we compute as community operating revenues less community operating expenses  increased to in from in  as our community operating revenues increased faster than our community operating expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for compared to for the increase of general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues is due  in part  to transferring our interest in the march communities 
the overall increase of million is primarily attributable to settlement and legal costs of the corio mediation see item legal proceedings and additional costs associated with increased professional liability insurance deductibles 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expenses remained constant at for both and this marginal increase is principally the result of six community acquisitions in  partially offset by the disposition of one skilled nursing facility 
rent 
rent expense decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the transfer of the march communities that converted to management agreements as discussed in total operating revenues above 
these communities accounted for million in rent expense for  partially offset by additional rent generation from six community acquisitions and normal increases in rent obligations from our existing portfolio 
rent as a percentage of revenues was for both and interest expense  net of interest income 
interest expense  net of interest income increased to million for from million for  representing an increase 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense remained at for both and the increase is primarily attributable to generally increasing mortgage interest expense associated with our variable rate debt  as well as the addition of six consolidated communities in early in addition  total debt increased approximately million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  impairment of investment securities 
during  we did not have an impairment of investment securities

the amount for the year includes a deficit funding obligation of million arising from our management of both the december and march communities in which we are responsible for cash operating deficits for such communities  write offs of million relating to receivables and capitalized development transaction costs that do not have future realizable value  losses of  associated with our investment in senior healthcare partners  llc  and other items aggregating million 
the amount for the year includes gain of million arising from a litigation settlement  gain of  from the sale of a canadian subsidiary  deficit funding obligation of million arising from our management of the december communities described above  and other items aggregating  extraordinary item 
we recognized extraordinary losses of approximately  in and none in our extraordinary loss resulted from the write off of loan fees and other related costs in conjunction with the refinancing of several of our mortgage financed communities 
comparison of years ended december  and total operating revenues 
total operating revenues decreased million to million for  from million for  representing a decrease 
at december  and at march   we transferred our interests in a total of owned and leased communities to others but continued to manage them under three year management agreements with rights of first refusal or options to acquire them in the future 
as a result  we now receive management fees from these communities rather than the revenues arising from their operations 
for  these communities were responsible for million in operating revenue while generating million in management fees for the same period in this decrease in revenue was partially offset  however  by generally increasing levels of occupancy throughout our consolidated communities 
average occupancy of the consolidated communities we owned and leased for rose to compared to for the owned and leased communities in the equivalent period  an increase of percentage points 
community operating expenses 
community operating expenses decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease 
as a percentage of total operating revenues  community operations decreased to for compared to for this reduction is primarily the result of the transfer of of our previously leased and owned communities to management agreements  as discussed in total operating revenues above 
these communities were responsible for million of community operating expenses as owned and leased communities in  because and were managed communities during and the nine months ended december   respectively  we were no longer responsible for their operating expenses 
this decrease was partially offset  however  by increased variable costs resulting from the significant occupancy gains in our communities and by increased sales and marketing costs 
our community operating margin  which we compute as community revenues less community operating expenses  has increased to for compared to for this improvement is  in part  because the communities that we transferred to management agreements generally experienced lower margins than our communities as a whole and  in part  because of cost control measures that we instituted in that affected our remaining owned and leased communities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for compared to for the increase of general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues is due  in part  to the shift from community revenues to management fees in the transfer of the communities referred to above 
the overall increase of million is attributable to greater personnel costs to support our increasing number of communities as well as increased marketing costs to enhance occupancy 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to for as compared to for rent 
rent expense decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the transfer of of our previously leased operating communities to management agreements as discussed above 
these communities accounted for million in rent expense for we leased an average of communities in  compared to an average of in rent as a percentage of revenues was and for and  respectively 
interest expense  net of interest income 
interest expense  net of interest income nominally changed to million for from million for  representing an increase of less than one percent 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense increased to for as compared to for this increase is primarily the result of an increase in mortgage interest expense due to the refinancing of several properties during the change in percentage of revenue is primarily the result of our decrease in revenues from the transfer of of our communities as discussed above 
in addition  total debt increased approximately million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  impairment of investment securities 
impairment of investment securities was million for in  we wrote down our investment in arv assisted living  inc  as we concluded the decline in the fair market value of this investment was other than temporary 
other  net 
other  net decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  other  net  decreased to in from in the million decrease results from the recognition of our portion of operating losses from two of our communities  gains realized on the sale of investment securities  and the disposition of communities in which did not occur in extraordinary item 
we recognized an extraordinary loss of  for  resulting from the write off of loan fees and other related costs in conjunction with the refinancing of several of our mortgage financed communities 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in  we recognized the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million related to the early adoption of statement of position sop  reporting on costs of start up activities  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization be expensed as incurred 
same community comparison we operated communities on a comparable basis during both the three months ended december  and the following table sets forth a comparison of same community results of operations  excluding general and administrative expenses  for the three months ended december  and three months ended december  dollar percentage change change in thousands revenue    community operating expense   community operating income    depreciation and amortization   rent   operating income    interest expense  net   other expense  net net income loss   the same communities represented million or of our total operating revenue for the quarter ended december  same community revenues increased million or to million for the three months ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in this increase in revenue is attributable to our shift from acquisitions to improving community operating performance through revenue per occupied unit 
for the quarter ended december  occupancy decreased to from for the quarter ended december  however  average monthly revenue per occupied unit increased to  for the quarter ended december  compared to  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended december   we generated operating income of million compared to an operating income of million for the comparable period in  an improvement of million or 
for the full years and  we operated communities on a comparable basis 
the following table sets forth a comparison of these same community results of operations  excluding general and administrative expenses for these two years 
year ended december  dollar percentage change change in thousands revenue    community operating expense    community operating income    depreciation and amortization   rent   operating income    interest expense  net   other expense  net net income   these same communities represented million or of our total operating revenue for same community revenues increased million or to million for compared to million for this increase in revenue is attributable to our shift from acquisitions to improving community operating performance through revenue per occupied unit 
for both and  occupancy remained constant at 
however  average monthly revenue per occupied unit increased to  for compared to  for for  we generated operating income of million and a net income of million  compared to operating income of million and net income of million for  an improvement of million or in operating income and an improvement of million or in net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the year ended december  cash decreased million to million as of december  net cash used by operating activities was million  which resulted from our net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  the decrease in other receivables and our accrued deficit funding obligation to fund the december and march communities more fully discussed under meditrust transactions 
net cash from investing was  this was derived from the release of million of restricted cash proceeds from the issuance of our series b preferred stock  offset by acquisitions of property and equipment  including one newly acquired community  and cash contributions to senior healthcare partners  llc for our equity investment 
net cash used by financing activities was  this was primarily attributable to repurchasing  shares of our common stock through public market transactions at an aggregate cost of million  payment of preferred dividends of million  and repayments of long term debt of million  offset by proceeds from long term debt in the community acquisitions denoted above of million and net proceeds from short term borrowings of  we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception  including net losses in excess of million in each of and to date  we have been unable to stabilize operations and occupancy at levels that would generate positive cash flow and  therefore  are dependent on third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations 
in addition  as of december   our working capital deficit was approximately million  due in part to million of mortgage debt that matures on april  we have been in discussions with the lender regarding an extension of the debt s maturity  or restructure and although we believe the issue will be resolved with the lender  there has been no agreement reached at this time and has no alternative commitment for refinancing 
if we are unable to extend the maturity of this debt  the lender could declare the entire amount immediately due and payable at maturity and could begin foreclosure proceedings with respect to the ten assisted living properties that secure this debt 
in addition  many of our remaining debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
such cross default provisions affect assisted living properties owned or leased by us 
accordingly  the inability to extend the debt due in april could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition if any other lender or lessor notifies us that we are in default under any debt instrument or lease 
the foregoing factors raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are pursuing several initiatives to mitigate this doubt  including on going discussions regarding extension of the debt due in april 
additionally  we will conduct advance discussions with other lenders and lessors that may be affected by cross default provisions  and take further steps to stabilize operations at positive cash flow levels including implementing rate increases and pursuing additional programs to increase occupancy  and if necessary  the sale of selected assets 
impact of inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
it could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on our senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
as a result  our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
we manage this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   our variable rate borrowings totaled million 
if market interest rates average more in than they did in  our interest expense and net loss would increase by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december  and do not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment nor does it consider possible actions that management could take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
