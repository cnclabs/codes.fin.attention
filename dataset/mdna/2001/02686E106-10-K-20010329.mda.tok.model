the mortgage base decreased as a result of mortgage dispositions with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million  representing an approximate decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the total mortgage portfolio since march asset management fees decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in the mortgage base

asset management fees decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in the mortgage base 
interest expense to affiliate decreased for as compared to  as a result of a decrease in interest payable to an affiliate of the partnership  american insured mortgage investors aim  on the debenture  as discussed below 
in  interest was due to aim for nine months 
in  no interest was due 
the debenture was redeemed on january  gains on mortgage dispositions decreased for as compared to as a result of gains recognized on seven mortgage prepayments in versus gains recognized on ten mortgage prepayments and one assignment  as discussed below  in losses were recognized on four mortgage prepayments in versus a loss recognized on one mortgage prepayment in during  the assignment proceeds of the mortgage on portervillage i apartments were received in the form of a debenture 
the debenture  with a face value of  was issued to the partnership  with interest payable semi annually on january and july in january  net proceeds of approximately million were received upon redemption of these debentures 
since the mortgage on portervillage i apartments was owned by the partnership and by aim  approximately million of the debenture proceeds was paid to aim liquidity and capital resources on october   criimi mae  the parent of the general partner  and criimi mae management  inc  an affiliate of criimi mae and provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code 
such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse effects to the partnership 
for example  as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner or to the general partner of cmslp  the partnership s sub advisor  without approval from the bankruptcy court 
even though this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
on november   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland  in greenbelt  maryland the bankruptcy court confirmed criimi mae s and criimi mae management  inc s third amended joint plan of reorganization as amended and supplemented by praecipes filed with the bankruptcy court on july  and  and november   the plan 
criimi mae is working to complete the debt documentation  evidencing the secured financings to be provided by the unsecured creditors  and merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc and german american capital corporation collectively the new debt documents 
on march   the bankruptcy court approved an extension of the date by which the plan must be effective to april  the official committee of unsecured creditors had previously filed its own plan of reorganization and proposed disclosure statement  but has asked the bankruptcy court  subject to completion of mutually acceptable debt documentation  to defer consideration of its plan and proposed disclosure statement 
there can be no assurance at this time that criimi mae will be able to complete the new debt documents and effectuate the plan by april  the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payment receipts or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance on insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in mortgage investment income  as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages  a decrease in net debenture proceeds  as discussed previously  and a decrease in the receipt of mortgage principal from scheduled payments 
net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to due to an increase in the amount of distributions paid to partners in versus cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the reduction in mortgage investment income  as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased in as compared to this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in proceeds received from the disposition of mortgages  as discussed previously
