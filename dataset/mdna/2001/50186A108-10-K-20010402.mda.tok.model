accordingly  operating results of lynch interactive corporation have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the statement of operations

interactive s net sales were million for the year ended december   and million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively

the customer can use this amount for future orders and  if not utilized  will be forfeited to lynch systems 
included in the backlog at december   is a million order for large glass press machines at lynch systems 
in connection with this order  lynch systems has obtained a substantial credit facility to protect advances by the customer and for working capital 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
working capital was therefore million as compared to million at december  cash used in operating activities was approximately million in compared to approximately million used in operations in capital expenditures were million in and million in overall capital expenditures are expected to be approximately higher than the level with the increases primarily at lynch systems and m tron 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under various credit facilities at the subsidiaries to fund such capital expenditure plans 
at december   total debt was million  which was million less than the million at the end of the reduction in debt is primarily due to principal repayments and the repurchase of debt by spinnaker which yielded a gain to the company of million after income tax provision and minority interest 
debt at year end included million of fixed interest rate debt  at an average interest rate of  and million of variable interest rate debt at an average interest rate of

also in january of  m tron amended its line of credit agreement with its bank to increase the line from million to million

payments of principal and interest are subject to restrictions contained in  and in any event are junior and subordinate in right of payment to  the payment of indebtedness outstanding under the spinnaker credit facility and senior notes 
the warren note matures on january   however  it can be prepaid earlier 
since  the board of directors of lynch has authorized the repurchase of  common shares 
at december   lynch s remaining authorization is to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
in  there were no shares purchased for treasury 
lynch corporation has had an active acquisition program and has generally financed each acquisition with a significant component of debt 
this acquisition debt contains restrictions on the amount of readily available funds that can be transferred to the parent company from its subsidiaries 
as the result of acquisitions  lynch consolidated and spinnaker have relatively high debt to equity ratios 
in addition  spinnaker s financial position has also been adversely affected by the continuation of depressed business conditions in the coating business 
the company has a need for resources to fund the operations of the holding company and future growth 
there currently is no credit facility in place at the lynch corporate level  and the company from time to time considers various long and short term financing arrangements 
in january  lynch received a cash dividend of million from m tron the company is exploring all options with respect to spinnaker  including liquifying and monetizing its investment  and is searching for ways to provide the company with a more financially visible investment with respect to m tron 
in the fall of  m tron filed a registration statement with respect to a rights offering to the company s shareholders 
the offering was delayed until market conditions are more favorable 
the company will continue to evaluate the situation but there is no assurance that any transaction will be implemented 
in march   the company completed the previously announced sale of  shares of its common stock to its chairman at per share  or million 
these funds are available for general corporate purposes 
the board of directors has adopted a policy of not paying cash dividends  a policy which is reviewed annually 
this policy takes into account the long term growth objectives of the company  especially its acquisition program  shareholders desire for capital appreciation of their holdings and the current tax law disincentives for corporate dividend distributions 
accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments and restricted cash 
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company generally maintains the majority of its debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a fixed long term basis or  on a limited basis  entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended in by sfas accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
the new standards require that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are required to be recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge criteria are set 
these standards became effective for the company beginning january  the company has determined the effect of this new standard  with the only impact being the value of the warrants obtained through the sale of central products 
at december   the warrants were valued at approximately 
million fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and were recorded at that value 
accordingly  spinnaker recognized a loss of million after a write down of these warrants to fair value during at december   approximately million  or of the company s long term debt and notes payable bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s and interest expense would have changed by 
million and 
million  respectively 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  investments  trade accounts receivable  and derivatives 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are located throughout the country and the company s policy is designed to limit exposure to any one institution 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the company s investment strategy 
other than certain accounts receivable  the company does not require collateral on these financial instruments 
in relation to export sales  the company requires letters of credit supporting a significant portion of the sales price prior to production to limit exposure to credit risk 
certain subsidiaries and business segments have credit sales to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at a level that management believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses 
the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of companies acquired goodwill is being amortized over amoritization periods ranging from twenty to forty years 
management continues to believe the methods and periods are appropriate see note to consolidated financial statements 
prospective information certain subsidiaries and business segments of the company sell to industries that are subject to cyclical economic changes 
any downturns in the economic environment as it appears  we are now experiencing would have financial impact on the company and its consolidated subsidiaries and may cause the reported financial information herein not to be indicative of future operating results  financial condition or cash flows
