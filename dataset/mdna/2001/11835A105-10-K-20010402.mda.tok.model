during  the company sold eight of its leasehold interests in hotel properties which resulted in gains of approximately million 
the operating profit contribution from these properties was not significant 
the company s balance sheet at december  included a deferred tax asset of  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the company during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
as a result of significant operating losses incurred in the fourth quarter of and the necessity to recognize significant asset impairment provisions see below  management elected to establish a valuation allowance for the full amount of the company s deferred tax assets 
this resulted in the recognition in the fourth quarter of of a net income tax charge of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources the company experienced quite significant revenue declines in versus and see results of operations below 
excluding revenues from hotel sales  the most significant portion of these declines occurred in the fourth quarter 
total revenues in the fourth quarter of were approximately million or less than in the same period in as a result of these declines  management increased the number of hotel properties being marketed for sale 
in  the company had placed five hotel properties for sale 
during  the company placed an additional properties for sale 
as previously discussed  several of these hotel sales were completed in and and as of december   the company had owned or leased properties classified as held for sale 
four of these properties were sold during the first quarter of and two others are presently under contract for sale 
management expects net proceeds from property sales to aggregate million to million 
the company has  outstanding on its bank line of credit which must be repaid on or prior to july  additionally  the company s current portion of notes payable at december  included mortgage notes which mature in secured by three hotel properties 
one of these properties was sold in and another is presently under contract for sale 
management expects to sell the third property prior to its note maturity or to negotiate an extension of the note s due date 
management further expects that proceeds from these and other property sales and from positive operating cash flows generated during spring and summer months will be sufficient to satisfy the line of credit obligation 
the company has suspended payment of preferred stock dividends and has negotiated deferrals of certain note payable obligations 
also  the company has terminated all but  of future development commitments 
management believes that these actions coupled with the proceeds from hotel sales and changes made in its hotel management operations see below will provide adequate liquidity for the company s operations for at least the next eighteen months 
results of operations the company conducts recurring operations in three segments of the limited service hotel industry hotel franchising  hotel management  and hotel operations 
the company generates additional revenues and results of operations from hotel development activities 
hotel franchising involves the selling and servicing of rights and licenses comprising the country hearth inn lodging system 
revenues include initial fees and continuing royalty  marketing and reservation fees from company owned and leased hotels and from unaffiliated customers 
continuing fees are based on each franchised hotel s room revenues 
hotel management involves the oversight of day to day hotel operations and accounting for limited service and some full service hotels 
revenues include continuing fees from company owned and leased hotels and from unaffiliated customers 
continuing fees are based on each managed hotel s revenues 
hotel operations involves the operations of company owned and leased hotels 
revenues are generated from unaffiliated hotel guests 
hotel operations also includes the company s share equity method of unconsolidated partnerships which also operate hotels and the minority interests share of consolidated entities results which are included in hotel operations 
hotel development involves the development and construction or purchase of existing hotel properties and subsequent sale thereof along with related activities such as servicing notes receivable generated from sales 
corporate activities are generally administrative and also include all interest income and expense which does not specifically relate to other segment operations 
franchise and management fees are charged to company owned and leased hotels at the same rates as charged to unaffiliated customers and are eliminated in consolidation 
hotel franchising segment hotel franchising revenues and income before taxes amounted to  and  respectively  in   and  respectively  in  and  and  respectively  in the results include termination fees of  from the orlando hotel sale transaction 
the remaining increases in revenues and profits are attributable to the previously discussed increases in the number of country hearth inns opened in   and revenues also include fees from company owned or leased hotels of  in   in  and  in management s continued goal is the expansion of the country hearth inn chain due to the higher profit margins on incremental franchise revenues as compared to the other operating segments 
hotel management segment hotel management revenues and income loss before taxes amounted to  and  respectively  in   and  respectively  in  and  and  respectively  in the results include termination fees of  from the orlando hotel sale transaction 
the remaining increases in revenues are attributable to the previously discussed increases in the number of properties managed 
revenues also include fees from company owned or leased hotels of  in   in  and  in the largest increase in recurring  non eliminating revenues in occurred in the hotel management segment 
this was attributable to a significant increase in the number of hotels managed for unaffiliated third parties 
excluding the effect of the orlando termination fees  third party management fees increased over  in versus unfortunately  hotel management operating expenses increased by more than  the incremental costs mostly payroll of servicing the additional third party management contracts exceeded the incremental revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed most of the key personnel involved in its hotel management segment and moved its hotel management operations to its corporate office in atlanta  georgia 
the hotel accounting function remains in prospect  ohio 
management is hopeful that this change will result in more efficient hotel management operations and that the performance of both third party owned hotels and company owned and leased properties will be improved 
hotel operations segment hotel revenues amounted to  in   in  and  in hotel earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rent ebitdar declined from  in to  in and to  in as previously discussed  the company had purchased and sold numerous properties during and the changes specified above are mostly attributable to those transactions 
the declines are mostly attributable to certain specific hotels as identified below 
revenues from the company s orlando florida hotel decreased  in primarily as a result of its impending destruction in january the company recognized  less revenues in from its daytona  florida hotel due to its sale in september the company recognized  less revenues in from its unit texas properties primarily as a result of the sale of one of these properties in early  the third  and final  of these texas properties was sold in the company s hotels in norcross and dalton  georgia experienced revenue declines of  in  both of these properties are included in the portfolio of held for sale properties 
other decreases resulting from and property sales are offset by and property additions from construction and acquisitions 
also  the company recognized a loss of  in its hotel operations segment relating to a joint venture investment which sold a hotel in  that investment will no longer impact the company s operations 
revenues  ebitdar  and income before taxes from the company s owned and leased rural gold properties increased in primarily as a result of property additions 
revenue per available room revpar at these hotels which were open for all of and increased slightly in the aggregate 
overall revpar declined slightly as a result of the newly opened properties still being in their ramp up stages 
management continues to believe in the rural gold concept and intends to commit additional resources  when available  to its growth 
management viewed hotel operations as a less profitable  but necessary  segment to support development and franchising activities 
growth of the country hearth inn brand has been partially effected through development activities which result in hotel ownership 
until hotel properties are eventually sold  the operations of the hotels impact the results of the company 
margins on hotel revenues are not considered to be as potentially profitable as the fee based segments franchising and management 
however  in order to grow the fee based segments  the company has had to invest in hotel operations assets 
note that owned and leased hotel operations contributed  in   in  and  in  to the fee based segments 
management no longer believes that development activities which result in hotel or leasehold ownership will be necessary to enhance the growth of the fee based segments 
partially as a source for capital and partially as a change in strategy  the company is presently offering many of its hotel properties for sale and does not plan to make additional development investments other than those presently committed 
other non segment related items other non segment related expenses in such as non mortgage related interest expense and corporate expenses were comparable to and and in line with management expectations 
development related revenues in primarily consisted of gains on property sales of  these gains resulted from the orlando hotel sale and the sale of leasehold interests previously discussed 
results included gains of  from the leasehold sales 
investment income increased from  in to  in primarily as a result of the notes receivable generated from the leasehold sales 
investment income in decreased as a result of paydowns on such note balances 
the year end note receivable balance increased as a result of the daytona hotel sale 
other income in  and amounted to   and  respectively 
the amount includes a  nonrecurring item 
changes in interest expense and depreciation expense are directly related to changes in owned hotel properties 
all company owned hotels are encumbered by mortgage obligations  most of which are fixed rate 
the company uses consistent straight line depreciation methods for all owned hotels which results in depreciation expense recognition consistent with hotel ownership changes 
an exception to this is that depreciation expense is not recognized on properties held for sale 
due to the significant number of properties which were classified as held for sale at the end of  depreciation expense is expected to be much less in property and leasehold interests held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
fair value of property and leasehold interests held for sale has been estimated by management based upon current market information 
at the date on which a decision is made to dispose of a property or leasehold interest  any amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value less cost to sell is reported as a provision for impairment 
during and  the company recorded provisions for impairment of  and  respectively  relating to its properties held for sale 
the company recorded an additional  provision for impairment in relating to two host leases because the lender has initiated foreclosure activities against host on two of the properties 
in  the company recognized an income tax benefit of  resulting primarily from a decrease in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company recognized income tax expense in of  which was approximately equal to of pretax income 
the company recognized income tax expense of  in as a result of the previously discussed increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance

effect of new accounting pronouncements on december   the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the staff s expressed intent in this bulletin was not to change current guidance  but rather to clarify existing guidance summarizing certain of the sec staff s reviews in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to revenue recognition circumstances 
sab no 
reiterated four criteria for revenue recognition persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services are rendered  the seller s price to purchase is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company implemented sab no 
 as required  in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december  the revenue recognition criteria in sab no 
were consistent with the company s existing revenue recognition policies and  as a result  the implementation of sab no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   the company adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial statements as the company had no derivative instruments as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company s obligations included variable rate mortgage notes and a line of credit bank note with aggregate principal balances of  which mature at various dates through the company is exposed to the market risk of significant increases in future interest rates 
each incremental point in the prime interest rate would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  per year 
this risk is somewhat mitigated in that inflationary increases in interest rates would theoretically result in increases in average hotel room rates 
also  significant increases in interest rates would have a dampening effect on additions of competitive hotels in the company s markets 
at december   the company s unrestricted investment securities included equity securities valued at  the company is exposed to the risk that such securities will become worthless 
the company s restricted investment securities also include equity securities 
such restricted securities comprise the assets of the company s deferred compensation plan and changes in the value of such securities have no net impact on the company s earnings 
the ultimate collection of the company s notes receivable is subject to various credit risks 
net notes receivable at december  amounted to  and consisted of notes  most of which were collateralized by or related to various hotel assets 
also  certain of these notes relate to leasehold interests in hotel properties for which the company remains contingently liable for future rent payments 
the collection of such notes receivable and the potential financial exposure for contingent rents is determinant on the ability of other hotel operators to satisfy these obligations 
their ability to satisfy such obligations is subject to many risks  including economic conditions affecting the hotel industry  their ability to effectively manage their hotel assets  new competition  and other factors
