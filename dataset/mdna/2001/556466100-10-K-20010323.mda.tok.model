additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements is contained in the company s sec reports  including the report on form k for the year ended december  overview since our inception in  we have developed  marketed  licensed and supported comprehensive enterprise application solutions for small and midsize manufacturers engaged in engineer to order  make to order  assemble to order  make to stock and mixed styles of production 
our principal product  mademanage enterprise edition mademanage  provides fully integrated solutions for all of the business processes used by manufacturers  from selling and design  through manufacturing and distribution 
this comprehensive enterprise application suite includes applications in enterprise resource planning erp  customer relationship management crm  supply chain management scm and business intelligence bi 
it also incorporates web based applications including mmvip  which offers manufacturing companies a range of collaborative opportunities with their customers  sales channels and suppliers  and mmexpert  which provides our customers with internet resources including support services hours per day  seven days a week  cyber consulting and virtual education courses 
during  we acquired bridgeware  inc  a company that offers advance planning and scheduling software  for a combination of cash and common stock totaling million 
mademanage is sold in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
in january  we entered into a distributor relationship with front technologies  inc  to sell  market and support our product in europe 
front technologies  inc  was recently acquired by ncr corporation 
the impact of this acquisition on our european sales activity has not yet been determined 
currently  approximately of our revenues are derived from customers in the united states 
our revenues are derived from software licenses  services and hardware 
software revenues are generated from licensing software to new customers  and from current customers increasing the number of licensed users and licensing new applications 
we recognize revenue from software license fees and hardware upon shipment to the customer following execution of a sales agreement 
services revenues are generated from annual fees paid by customers to receive support services and software upgrades and also from implementation  education and consulting services 
support is typically purchased as part of the initial sales agreement and is renewable annually 
support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
services revenues from implementation  education and consulting services are generally included in the initial agreement 
we recognize revenue from these services as they are performed 
beginning in  virtual and classroom education courses are offered via timelearn  a subscription based education program  which is accessible through the mmexpert web site 
subscription revenues from mmexpress and mmvip are also reflected in services revenues and are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
hardware revenues are generated primarily from the sale of bar coding and data collection equipment used in connection with mademanage and constitute a relatively small component of total revenues 
software revenues for a particular quarter depend substantially on orders received and products shipped in that quarter 
furthermore  large orders may be significant to operating income in the quarter in which the corresponding revenue is recognized 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our statements of operations for the periods indicated

total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in total revenues increased by million  or  in from million in the increase in was driven by increases in software and services revenues  while the increase in was primarily due to an increase in services revenues 
we have not historically recognized significant annual revenues from any single customer 
although revenues increased year over year in and  we believe we were adversely affected by the industry wide trend of delays in new business system purchases  as evidenced by the decrease in the number of new system orders year over year in and the slow down  which began around the middle of and continued through the first half of  was due in part to year impacts on buying decisions 
we also believe manufacturers were experiencing some confusion regarding e commerce solutions  which further delayed buying decisions 
see business environment and risk factors year market dynamics for a description of year market dynamics and potential revenue impact 
software revenues 
software license revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in and decreased by million  or  in from million in software license revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in software revenues in was attributed to an increase in the average order size  which offset the decrease in the number of license transactions 
the decrease in software revenues in compared to was mainly due to a lower volume of license transactions and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average contract size 
services revenues 
services revenues increased by  or  to million in from million in and increased by million  or  in from million in services revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increases in services revenues were largely due to support fees from an expanding user base 
however  while other services revenues increased in due to greater utilization by customers of our expanded consulting  customization and education offerings  these revenues decreased in as a result of the decrease in the number of new system orders 
hardware revenues 
hardware revenues in were substantially flat compared to at million and increased by  or  in from  in hardware revenues constituted  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the hardware equipment sold was bar coding and data collection equipment necessary to utilize certain features of mademanage 
although the number of new system orders decreased  hardware revenues remained flat in and even increased in due to increased demand for this equipment as a result of continued expansion of the number of customers using our software 
subscription revenues 
subscription revenues from mmexpress  which was introduced mid  totaled  for the year 
there were no revenues from mmvip  which was launched in the third quarter however  more than customers were signed up for mmvip services by the end of the year 
subscription revenues are included in services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
international revenues 
international revenues totaled  in for software  hardware and support and represented of total revenues 
costs of revenues costs of software revenues 
costs of software revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of software revenues  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit percentages in and were due to a greater proportion of software revenues generated from third party products 
additionally  royalties associated with the upgrade of mademanage to the microsoft sql server database were introduced in the third quarter and are reflected in costs of software revenues 
write down and amortization of purchased technology 
in august  we acquired bridgeware  inc  which gave rise to the purchased technology asset 
during the third quarter  we decided to accelerate development of an integrated multi level planning suite that will largely replace the acquired technology 
that decision resulted in an impairment of the purchased technology asset  which was written down to its net realizable value 
the non cash write down and amortization of purchased technology in was million as compared to amortization of  and  in and  respectively 
see operating expenses acquired in process technology for comparative pro forma results of operations excluding the acquired in process technology charge and the write down and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of bridgeware 
costs of services revenues 
costs of services revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting in gross profits of  and of services revenues  respectively 
the gross profit percentages continue to increase as services and support revenues increase with our expanding customer base 
at the same time  staffing levels  which were increased in to accommodate the growing customer base  remained relatively flat in due to operating efficiencies 
costs of hardware revenues 
costs of hardware revenues totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
gross profits from hardware were  and of hardware revenues in  and  respectively 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in and were primarily due to increased i staffing for sales and marketing  ii marketing activities  including promotional activities  iii travel expenses related to sales and marketing efforts  iv costs associated with starting up the international sales effort and v costs associated with marketing mmexpress and mmvip with substantially no offsetting revenues 
product development expenses 
product development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we did not capitalize any software development costs during these years  since the capitalizable portion was not significant 
product development expense increases in were related to i enhancements to existing products and development of new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers  ii an expanded quality assurance organization to increase customer satisfaction and iii the full year impact of the bridgeware development workforce  which was acquired in august in  we were able to continue progress in the aforementioned areas while at the same time containing costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in expenses in resulted primarily from additional costs incurred to support the growth of operations 
this enhanced infrastructure was also adequate to support the level of growth in  resulting in moderate expense increases in write down and amortization of goodwill 
in august  we recorded purchased technology and related goodwill associated with the acquisition of our bridgeware subsidiary 
during the third quarter  we decided to accelerate development of an integrated multi level planning suite that will largely replace the acquired technology 
that decision resulted in an impairment of the purchased technology asset and related goodwill  which were written down to their net realizable value 
the non cash write down and amortization of goodwill in was  as compared to amortization of  and  in and  respectively 
see operating expenses acquired in process technology for comparative pro forma results of operations excluding the acquired in process technology charge and the write down and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of bridgeware 
acquired in process technology 
this charge of million in was a result of the amounts assigned to in process technology in connection with the acquisition of bridgeware 
on a pro forma basis  exclusive of the bridgeware acquisition charge for in process technology and write down and amortization of intangible assets  results of operations would be comparatively reported as follows 
results excluding the acquired in process technology charge and the write down and amortization of intangible assets related to the bridgeware acquisition year ended december  in thousands  except per share data total revenues    operating income loss    net income loss   per share amounts basic net income loss per share average number of shares    diluted net income loss per share average number of shares    intangible assets include purchased technology  assembled workforce and goodwill recorded in connection with the bridgeware acquisition 
other income  net other income  net was   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
other income  net principally reflects interest earned on the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering  which was completed in december income tax provision benefit the income tax provision benefit effective rate was  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the write down and amortization of goodwill and the acquired in process technology charge  the income tax provision benefit effective rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the write down and amortization of goodwill and the acquired in process technology charge are not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through equity capital  including the initial public offering of common stock in december  debt and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the net change in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was a reduction of million  million and  in  and  respectively 
purchases of computer equipment and office furniture aggregated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  in  we generated million of cash flows from operations and used million in connection with the acquisition of our bridgeware subsidiary 
at december   we had working capital of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the average accounts receivable days outstanding was days at december   and days as of december  the increase in the average accounts receivable days outstanding was primarily driven by increases in average order size  support renewals and deferred revenues 
deferred revenue increased to million at december   from million at december  deferred revenue principally relates to support agreements or contracted services  and the current portion of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized in revenue during the next twelve months 
deferred revenue increased primarily as a result of high support renewal rates from the installed base of customers and from sales of new systems that contain support and service components  which are recognized on a straight line basis over the support period or when the service is delivered 
we have a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank that expires on april   borrowings under which bear interest at the prime rate at december  
loans under the revolving credit agreement are limited to million 
we have not borrowed under the revolving line of credit 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and credit commitments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through year the year issue relates to whether computer systems are able to properly recognize and process information relating to dates in and after the year prior to january   significant uncertainty existed in the software industry concerning the potential consequences that might have occurred from the failure of software to adequately address the year issue 
we have not encountered any year compliance issues relating to our currently developed and actively marketed software products or with our internal computer information system and non computer systems 
we expensed all costs related to preparation for year issues 
the total costs of evaluation and compliance were not material 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
consistent with the requirements to implement sab no later than the fourth quarter for fiscal years beginning after december   we adopted the provisions of sab and the resulting impact was immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business environment and risk factors in addition to other information contained in this report  the following factors could affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from those achieved in the past or expressed in our forward looking statements 
fluctuations of quarterly operating results  seasonality we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
a substantial portion of our software license revenues in each quarter is from licenses signed and product shipped in that quarter  and such revenues historically have been recorded largely in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of revenues mostly in the last week of that third month 
accordingly  our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and delays in closings of sales near the end of a quarter or product delivery could cause quarterly revenues and  to a greater degree  net income to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
in addition  we have experienced a seasonal pattern in our operating results  with the fourth quarter typically having the highest total revenues and operating income and the first quarter having historically reported lower revenues and operating income compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year 
other factors  many of which are beyond our control  that may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results include the size of individual orders  the timing of product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  competition and pricing in the manufacturing software industry  market acceptance of new products  reduction in demand for existing products  the shortening of product life cycles as a result of new product introductions by us or our competitors  product quality problems  personnel changes  conditions or events in the manufacturing industry  and general economic conditions 
the sales cycle for mademanage typically ranges from three to nine months 
however  license signing may be delayed for a number of reasons outside of our control 
since software is generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without significant backlog 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition can cause a significant fluctuation in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
in addition  we may increase operating expenses in anticipation of continued growth and to fund expanded product development efforts 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
year market dynamics we believe the year phenomenon reduced demand for enterprise business systems in and we believe that in certain customers and potential customers were engaged in testing and correcting year system problems  and such customers may have chosen to defer system investments during  negatively impacting our revenues 
additionally  each customer s evaluation of its year compliance with other internal systems potentially lengthened the sales cycle 
in contrast  sales may have been increased due to customers need to address their business system requirements in conjunction with year system issues 
product and market concentration our revenues are currently derived from licenses of mademanage  including optional modules and third party software  and related support  services and hardware 
in the near term  mademanage and related services are expected to continue to account for substantially all of our revenues 
accordingly  any event that adversely affects the sale of mademanage  such as competition from other products  significant quality problems  incompatibility with third party hardware or software products  negative publicity or evaluation  reduced market acceptance of  or obsolescence of the hardware platforms on  or software environments in which mademanage operates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends substantially upon the software expenditures of small and midsize manufacturers  which in part depend upon the demand for such manufacturers products 
an economic slow down or other adverse event affecting manufacturing industries in the united states could impact such demand  causing manufacturers in our target market to curtail or postpone capital expenditures for business information systems 
any adverse change in the amount or timing of software expenditures by our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party technologies mademanage uses a variety of third party technologies  including operating systems  tools and other applications developed and supported by microsoft corporation microsoft 
there can be no assurance that microsoft will continue to support the operating systems  tools and other applications utilized by mademanage or that they will continue to be widely accepted in our target market 
mademanage relies heavily on microsoft visual studio and microsoft sql server  and there can be no assurance that microsoft will not discontinue or otherwise fail to support visual studio or sql server or any of its components 
in addition  we use a number of other programming tools and applications  including activex  ole  odbc  oledb  msmq  site server and internet information server 
we sublicense various third party products  including microsoft visual foxpro  microsoft sql server  microsoft project  products from powerway  best software  ads inc  interact commerce and frx  and bar code hardware and software 
there can be no assurance that these third party vendors will continue to support these technologies or that these technologies will retain their level of acceptance among manufacturers in our target market 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and rapid technological change our growth and future financial performance depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications and to develop and introduce new applications to incorporate technological advances that satisfy customer requirements or expectations 
as a result of the complexities inherent in product development  there can be no assurance that either improvements to mademanage or applications that we develop in the future will be delivered on a timely basis or ultimately accepted in the market 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological development or end user requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could damage our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internet and potential for subscription revenue business model we believe the internet is changing the way businesses operate and therefore the software needs of customers 
we believe customers will increasingly require e business applications and software solutions that will enable them to engage in commerce or service over the internet 
if we are unable to respond to emerging industry standards and technological changes  we may not be able to deliver products and services that meet our customers changing needs 
if we are not successful in addressing these changing needs  our products may become obsolete and our financial results may be materially and adversely impacted 
furthermore  advances in internet and e commerce applications may lead the enterprise business system market to rapid acceptance of application service provider asp  a hosted method of delivering business system solutions 
the asp method of delivery uses a subscription revenue model  and although subscriptions could improve predictability of future revenue  it delays revenue recognition and cash collections as compared to the current method 
therefore  if there is a rapid change to the asp business model  our near term financial results and financial position may be materially and adversely impacted 
dependence on key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees  including members of senior management 
no employee is subject to an employment contract 
our ability to implement business strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to attract  on a timely basis  and retain skilled personnel  especially sales  service  support and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we compete for such personnel with numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the key employees or the failure to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth  international expansion we have experienced growth in our domestic business and operations 
while we have managed this growth to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively do so in the future 
our ability to manage growth successfully is contingent on a number of factors including our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems and to motivate and effectively manage employees 
we have begun to distribute mademanage in international markets  primarily the united kingdom 
we have no significant experience in international markets  and there can be no assurance that such expansion can be successfully accomplished or that mademanage will be successfully adapted or accepted in the international markets 
additionally  we rely extensively on our distributor in the united kingdom  front technologies  inc  to sell and service the united kingdom market place 
front technologies  inc  was recently acquired by ncr corporation 
the impact of this acquisition has not yet been determined 
if front technologies  inc  is unable or unsuccessful in promoting  selling and servicing mademanage  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
at present  our international plans include only canada and the united kingdom 
risks associated with acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment market coverage  enhance technological capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to our ability to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations 
insufficient customer commitment to obtain the benefits of mademanage  customers must commit resources to implement and manage the product and to train their employees in the use of the product 
the failure of customers to commit sufficient resources to those tasks or to carry them out effectively could result in customer dissatisfaction with mademanage 
if a significant number of customers became dissatisfied  our reputation could be tarnished and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition the business management applications software market is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product offerings and other market activities 
we face competition from a variety of software vendors  including application software vendors  software tool vendors and relational database management system vendors 
a number of companies offer products that are directed at the market for business management systems 
the technologies we use to develop mademanage are generally available and widely known and include technologies developed by microsoft 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products based on the same technology upon which mademanage is based 
our competitors include a large number of international  national and regional software and system vendors  many of which are public companies 
several large technology companies have recently expanded into the business management systems market by acquiring established vendors in the market 
additionally  several software companies that have traditionally marketed business management systems to larger manufacturers have announced initiatives to market business management systems to small and midsize manufacturers 
compared to us  many of the existing competitors  as well as a number of potential competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and a larger installed base of customers 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not offer or develop products that are superior to mademanage or that achieve greater market acceptance 
if such competition were to result in significant price declines or loss of market share for mademanage  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected 
relationships with value added resellers we distribute our software products through a direct sales force and a network of value added resellers vars 
a significant portion of licenses of mademanage sold to new customers is sold by vars 
if some or all of the vars reduce their efforts to sell mademanage  promote competing products or terminate their relationships with us  our business  financial condition and results of operation would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  vars frequently develop strong relationships with their customers  so if vars criticize us or our products to their customers  our reputation could be damaged  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  we rely extensively on our distributor in the united kingdom  front technologies  inc  to sell and service the united kingdom market place 
front technologies  inc  was recently acquired by ncr corporation 
the impact of this acquisition has not yet been determined 
if front technologies  inc  is unable or unsuccessful in promoting  selling and servicing mademanage  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
product liability and lack of insurance we market  sell and support software products used by manufacturers to manage their business operations and to store substantially all of their operational data 
software programs as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors  despite testing  which are discovered only after the product has been installed and used by customers 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or future releases of our software or that any such errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products 
a customer could be required to cease operations temporarily and some or all of its key operational data could be lost or damaged if its information systems fail as the result of human error  mechanical difficulties or quality problems in mademanage or third party technologies utilized by mademanage 
we have insurance covering product liability or damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions  however there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate 
a claim against us  if successful and of a sufficient magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on proprietary rights  risk of infringement we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop products incorporating technology that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we have a united states patent for software related to materials requirements planning regeneration and patent applications pending for software included in mademanage related to a navigational interface and an e commerce hosting approach for the enterprise 
however  we have no other patents or patent applications pending  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
in the event that we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that our technology infringes on the intellectual property of third parties  that we would prevail against any such claims or that a licensing agreement will be available on reasonable terms in the event of an unfavorable ruling on any such claim 
any such claim  with or without merit  would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial control by single shareholder as of march   hambrecht quist h q and its affiliates  as a group  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  h q and its affiliates will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
concentration of stock ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
effect of antitakeover provisions our amended and restated articles of incorporation the articles authorize the board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  up to two million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as the board of directors may determine in its sole discretion 
the mademanage systems  inc  stock option plan the option plan provides that  unless the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors decides to the contrary  all outstanding options vest and become immediately exercisable upon a merger or similar transaction 
in addition  certain provisions of indiana law could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control 
further  certain provisions of indiana law impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions 
the foregoing provisions could discourage an attempt by a third party to acquire a controlling interest without the approval of management even if such third party were willing to purchase shares of common stock at a premium over its then market price 
possible volatility of stock price the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new applications by us or our competitors  the failure of earnings to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  as well as other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price of many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
shares eligible for future sale the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  of which  shares of common stock are restricted shares  which are subject to volume and other limitations of rule and rule restrictions under the securities act 
as of march   there were  options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share under the company s stock option plans  of which options to purchase  shares of common stock were then vested and exercisable 
at march   we had reserved  shares of common stock for future grant under the option plan 
we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under the mademanage systems  inc  employee stock purchase plan the stock purchase plan 
as of march    shares have been issued under the stock purchase plan 
we have filed registration statements registering shares of common stock issued pursuant to the mademanage systems  inc  stock option plan and stock purchase plan on january  accordingly  shares issued pursuant to these plans will be saleable in the public market upon issuance  subject to certain restrictions 
absence of dividends we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  for the development of our business 
investment risk despite the high credit ratings on our cash equivalents and investments  there is no assurance such agencies will not default on their obligations which could result in losses of principal and accrued interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we transact limited business in various foreign currencies  primarily in the british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
we do not have any significant receivables or obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not have any foreign currency swaps or derivatives  and we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange risk
