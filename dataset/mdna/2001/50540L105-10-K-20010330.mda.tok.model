the insurance underwriting services market continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing and on the integration of additional services such as paramedical services or connectivity 
labone continues to maintain its market leadership by providing quality products and services at competitive prices 
prices may continue to decline during due to competitive pressures 
this trend may have a material impact on earnings from operations 
effective november   labone acquired world wide health services  inc and world wide health services of new jersey  a provider of specimen collection and paramedical examination services to life and health insurers 
these subsidiaries are operated under the name examone world wide examone and included in the insurance services division of labone 
the paramedical industry is a low gross margin industry 
a substantial percentage of the revenue from a specimen collection is paid back to the contracted phlebotomist or physician 
as the revenue from examone grows as a percentage of total labone revenue  its lower gross margins will add to the total profitability of labone but will reduce the average gross profit margin percentage 
in the healthcare division  the company continued its trend of growth through the lab card program  aggressive marketing to the physician community and new managed care agreements 
the lab card program now has more than million members 
in  the program added its largest client to date  coventry health care formerly principal life insurance company 
the program continued to expand through new members as well as increased participation from existing members

managed care organizations and the physicians who are under their contracts continue to choose labone for its high quality testing  disease management data capabilities  and responsive customer service and support 
in addition to its urine drug testing  the sat division of labone has introduced the intercept drug testing service  a laboratory based service that identifies commonly used illicit drugs in oral fluid samples 
the oral fluid collection avoids the process of collecting and handling of urine samples which has been criticized for being invasive  demeaning and expensive 
the collection with the intercept device is directly observable and efficient 
labone markets this new service to employers nationwide 
a specific bad debt risk exposure exists in the sat division 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with one of its largest sat clients whereby the company exchanged its trade receivable from the sat client for a short term note receivable 
in conjunction with the exchange  the company obtained additional guarantees and more favorable terms under a related services agreement with the sat client

there may be an adverse and material financial effect on the company in the event of default on this agreement by the sat client

the company has estimated the exposure based on historical information and expected collection rates  and has reserved an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s new facility was financed through the city of lenexa  kansas  with industrial revenue bonds

the company paid million  including transaction costs  to complete the merger and purchase million shares of labone stock 
the minority million shares of former labone stock were exchanged on a one for one basis for the combined company stock 
the transaction was recorded under purchase accounting and resulted in million in goodwill which is being amortized over years 
interest on the industrial revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of the company s new facility is based on a taxable seven day variable rate which  including letter of credit and remarketing fees  is approximately as of march  the bonds mature over the next nine years in increments of million per year plus interest

the financial impact resulting from paying additional bank fees is considered immaterial
