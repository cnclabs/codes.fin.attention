item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  markets  sells and supports comprehensive delivery and management software that enables effective and efficient deployment and management of enterprise applications  including those designed for microsoft windows r operating systems and unix r operating systems 
the company s application servers product line  which comprises the largest source of the company s revenue  primarily consists of the metaframe tm products and related options 
the metaframe products  which began shipping in the second quarter of  permit organizations to deploy and manage applications without regard to location  network connection or type of client hardware platforms 
on may   the company and microsoft entered into a license  development and marketing agreement  as amended the development agreement  which provides for the licensing to microsoft of certain of the company s multi user software enhancements to microsoft s windows nt server and for the cooperation between the parties for the development of certain future multi user versions of microsoft windows nt server  terminal server edition and microsoft windows collectively  windows server operating systems 
the development agreement also provides for each party to develop its own enhancements to the jointly developed products  which may provide access to windows server operating systems base platforms from a wide variety of computing devices 
in june  the company released its metaframe product  a company developed enhancement that implements the independent computing architecture ica r on the windows server operating systems 
in addition  microsoft and the company have agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote the use of windows server operating systems based multi user software and the company s ica protocol 
pursuant to the terms of the development agreement  in may  the company received million as a non refundable royalty payment for engineering and support services to be rendered by the company 
under the terms of the development agreement  as amended  the company received additional payments totaling million 
no additional payments are due pursuant to the development agreement 
as a result of the development agreement  the company continues to support the microsoft windows nt platform  but the metaframe products and later releases no longer directly incorporate windows nt technology 
for example  the company s metaframe for unix products enable the deployment and management of applications designed for unix operating systems such as sun solaris  hp ux  or ibm aix collectively  unix operating systems 
the company plans to continue developing enhancements to its metaframe products and expects that these products and associated options will constitute a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
revenue is recognized when earned 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations  software revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment of the software product only if no significant company obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
the initial fee of million relating to the development agreement is being recognized ratably over the five year term of the contract  which began in may the additional million received pursuant to the development agreement  as amended  is being recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract  effective april in the case of non cancelable product licensing arrangements under which certain original equipment manufacturers oems have software reproduction rights  initial recognition of revenue also requires delivery and customer acceptance of the product master or first copy 
subsequent recognition of revenues is based upon reported royalties from the oems 
revenue from packaged product sales to distributors and resellers is recorded when related products are shipped 
the company also distributes software through electronic licensing 
these revenues are recognized when the customer is provided with the activation keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software pursuant to an agreement or purchase order 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products  post contract customer support pcs  and or other services  the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company sells software and pcs separately and vsoe is determined by the price charged when each element is sold separately 
product returns and sales allowances  including stock rotations  are estimated and provided for at the time of sale 
non recurring engineering fees are recognized ratably as the work is performed 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are performed 
service and subscription revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades are based on the price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically twelve to twenty four months 
service revenues are included in net revenues on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the company adopted the provisions of sab in october sab does not supersede the software industry specific revenue recognition guidance  but provides current interpretations of software revenue recognition requirements 
the adoption of sab did not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has acquired and licensed technology related to its strategic objectives 
in february  june  july and july  the company completed the acquisitions of insignia solutions  plc for approximately million  apm limited for approximately million  vdonet corporation limited for approximately million  and viewsoft  inc for approximately million  respectively 
in january  the company licensed certain software technology from epicon  inc  for approximately million payable in cash 
in december  the company amended its license agreement with epicon to allow the company access to additional software technology and to extend the exclusive license term for an additional million  payable in equal installments upon completion of project phases  of which million was paid in cash at the amendment date  million was paid in  and the remainder is expected to be paid in in february  the company acquired all of the operating assets of the innovex group  inc innovex for approximately million in cash  of which million was paid at the closing date  and the balance is payable  in equal installments  and months after the closing date contingent upon future events  as defined in the acquisition agreement 
these acquisitions and the licensing arrangement were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for business combinations 
the company allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
except for innovex  the acquired intangible assets included in process technology projects  among other assets  which were related to research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  the company s overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and certain factors which may affect future results which may impact the company s future performance and financial position

net revenues 
net revenues are presented below in five categories application servers  management products  computing appliances products  microsoft royalties and services and other revenue 
application servers revenue primarily represents fees related to the licensing of the company s metaframe products  subscriptions for product support  updates and upgrades and additional user licenses 
management products consist of load balancing services  resource management services and other options 
computing appliances products revenue consists of license fees and royalties from oems who are granted a license to incorporate and or market the company s multi user technologies in their own product offerings 
microsoft royalties represent fees recognized in connection with the development agreement 
services and other revenue consist primarily of consulting in the delivery of implementation services and systems integration solutions  as well as customer support 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in application servers revenue resulting from an increase in the number of metaframe licenses sold 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the winframe product line 
winframe is windows application server software based on windows nt 
the company expects that sales of metaframe based products will continue to make up a large percentage of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues in was also due to an increase in the volume of shipments of management products  specifically  load balancing services and resource management services  and to a lesser extent an increase in services revenue due mainly to additional consulting revenue resulting from the innovex acquisition 
the company anticipates that revenue from the development agreement with microsoft will account for a decreasing percentage of net revenues 
net revenues from computing appliances products declined in due to decreased volume of licensing to oems 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to increases in the volume of shipments of the company s metaframe products and associated additional user licenses  which began shipping in june  while sales of the winframe products and associated additional user licenses decreased 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues in was due to an increase in revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft and increases in the volume of shipments of management products  primarily due to higher sales levels of the load balancing services product as end users implemented larger scale metaframe solutions 
net revenues of computing appliances products declined in due to decreased volume of licensing to oems 
an analysis of the company s net revenues is presented below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to application servers management products computing appliances products microsoft royalties services and other revenue net revenues international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for additional information on the breakdown of international revenues  please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this annual report 
the increase in international revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the company s increased sales and marketing efforts and continued demand for the company s products in europe and asia 
the company anticipates that international revenues will account for an increasing percentage of net revenues in the future 
an analysis of geographic segment net revenue is presented below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to americas emea asia pacific other consolidated net revenues the increase in net revenues in and was primarily attributable to greater sales and marketing efforts and continued demand for the company s products in the americas and europe  middle east africa emea regions and larger scale metaframe implementations in these regions 
the emea revenue increase in was also due to the opening and expansion of additional sales offices in that region 
the company expects to continue investing in international markets and expanding its international operations by establishing additional foreign operations  hiring personnel  expanding its international sales force and adding new third party channel partners 
international revenues may fluctuate in future periods as a result of difficulties in staffing  dependence on an independent distribution channel  competition  variability of foreign economic and political conditions and changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  localized product release timing and related issues of marketing such products in foreign countries 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
all development costs incurred in connection with the development agreement are expensed as incurred and are reported as cost of revenues 
the company s cost of revenues exclude amortization of core technology 
cost of revenues also consists of compensation and other personnel related costs for consulting services 
gross margin 
the decrease in gross margin as a percent of net revenues from to was primarily due to reserves for obsolete inventory on hand and the impact of the consulting services business which has a lower gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenue than that associated with the sale of software licenses 
the inventory reserved for obsolescence was destroyed in this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in sales of electronic licenses  which have a higher gross margin versus traditional packaged product as a percentage of product revenue 
the company anticipates gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will increase from current levels but will remain below historical levels as the company increases its consulting services offering 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of net revenues from to was primarily due to increases in sales of the metaframe product and related user licenses 
the metaframe products have a relatively high gross margin contribution as the metaframe products bear less royalties than those associated with the winframe products 
gross margin related to the development agreement increased from to due primarily to an increase in revenue related to the development agreement as well as a decrease in related engineering and support expenses which resulted from the maturity level of the metaframe product 
the overall increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues for was partially offset by an increase in inventory reserves 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred except for certain intangible assets related to the acquisitions and licensed technology described herein 
increases in research and development expenses in and resulted primarily from additional staffing  associated salaries and related expenses required to expand and enhance the company s product lines 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses in and resulted primarily from increased headcount levels of sales  services and marketing staff and associated salaries  commissions and expenses in order to increase the company s sales  consulting and marketing efforts 
the increase was also due to higher levels of promotional activities and marketing programs directed at customer and business partner acquisition and retention  and additional advertising activities related to specific product lines and corporate branding 
promotional activities include various demand generation programs as well as direct mail campaigns  programs directed at resellers and trade shows 
general and administrative expenses 
increases in general and administrative expenses in and resulted primarily from increased staff  associated salaries and related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the company s operations 
the increase in was also due to an increase in legal fees relating to litigation and general corporate matters 
amortization of intangible assets 
the increases in amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in and are primarily due to the acquisition of apm ltd 
in june  vdonet corporation ltd 
in july  and viewsoft  inc in july these acquisitions resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of approximately million  million and million  respectively  at their respective date of acquisition 
additionally  for  the increase was also due to the acquisition of innovex in february which resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of approximately million 
as of december   the company had net goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  associated with these transactions  remaining to be amortized over three to four years following the acquisitions 
the company anticipates that amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets will decrease from levels due to the write downs of core technology recorded in the fourth quarter of see further discussion under write down of technology 
in process research and development 
in  the company completed the acquisition of certain in process software technologies from viewsoft  in which it allocated million of the purchase price to ipr d 
during  the company completed acquisitions and a licensing of certain in process software technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to ipr d 
the company allocated million  million and million in for ipr d related to the insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions  respectively  and million in for ipr d related to the licensing agreement with epicon 
since the respective dates of acquisition and licensing  the company has used some of the acquired in process technology to develop new product offerings and enhancements  which have or will become part of the company s suite of products when completed 
for projects completed  such as those associated with the epicon and insignia transactions  functionality included in products using the acquired in process technology have been introduced at various times following the respective transaction dates of the acquired assets and licensing 
acquired technology associated with the apm and vdonet acquisitions were written down in the fourth quarter of  as further discussed below under write down of technology 
the company currently expects to complete the development of the remaining projects associated with the viewsoft acquisition in upon completion  the company intends to offer the related products to its customers 
the nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products or features and functionalities within the company s suite of existing products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the company currently expects that products utilizing the remaining acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the software industry  particularly in the server based computing environment  changes in technology  changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause the company to alter or abandon product plans 
failure to complete the development of the viewsoft project in its entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in process research and development will not deviate from the projections used to initially value such technology when acquired 
ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed technology  and the company as a whole  are subject to a variety of factors  which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transactions 
a description of the in process research and development and the estimates made by the company for each of the apm  vdonet and viewsoft transactions is summarized below 
all of the acquired projects were targeted for the server based computing market 
apm the in process research and development acquired in the apm acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project 
the project is a windows nt based application server for java applications 
at the date of the acquisition  apm was shipping a java application server solution that allowed an enterprise user to access java applets from the internet and execute these applets outside the corporate firewall in a server based computing configuration in a fashion that was transparent to the enterprise user 
apm was in the process of modifying its software product to incorporate changes necessary for it to interface with java  which was a major new release that included major rewrites to the java desktop 
following the acquisition  the company planned on continuing the process of incorporating changes necessary to interface with java  and in addition  planned on further developing the software product into an application server for java that would operate in a metaframe server environment 
the company estimated this project was less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to the in process research and development was million 
in the second quarter of  management changed the java application server to a java performance pack product  which adds performance enhancements and management tools to other citrix products 
at the time of the acquisition  it was anticipated that there was a growing need and momentum in the market to develop and run java client applications 
since the acquisition  the market has not developed as anticipated 
as a result  the company has no current plans to further develop this technology 
vdonet the in process research and development acquired in the vdonet acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project  ica video services 
this project allows video applications and applications containing video to be viewed on an ica client  and was targeted for the server based computing market 
at the date of the acquisition  vdonet was shipping a client server video streaming product that was not operational in a windows nt or in a metaframe environment 
vdonet was in the process of modifying its software to be operational in a windows nt environment 
in addition  vdonet was developing enhancements that would provide for a live camera feed and multicast  which was intended to direct a video stream to multiple client devices simultaneously 
the company estimates this project was less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to the in process research and development was million 
following the acquisition  the company continued the process of modifying the vdonet software to be operational in a windows nt environment 
subsequent development efforts resulted in the videoframe product  which was shipped in the third quarter of  but has resulted in few sales to end users 
since the acquisition  the company explored alternative uses for the acquired technology 
these uses related primarily to delivering video applications in a server based computing environment and video streaming with ica devices 
currently  the company has no plans to further develop this technology 
viewsoft the in process research and development acquired in the viewsoft acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project  viewsoft internet this project enables multi tier  web based application development and deployment 
at the date of the valuation  viewsoft was in development with this product 
the product was intended to operate in the multi tier web application market and was not intended to operate in a metaframe environment 
the company is currently exploring the use of the product for the development of portal ware applets 
the company estimated this project was approximately complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to in process research and development was million 
the remaining efforts to complete the project relate primarily to applet development  on going stress testing and  to a lesser extent  bug fixes and documentation 
the research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily to potential product limitations revealed during testing 
the actual and estimated costs to complete and completion dates of the in process and core technology acquired for each acquisition are as follows apm vdonet viewsoft in thousands date acquired june july july cost incurred to date    estimated cost to complete  total estimated project cost    estimated cost to complete at date of valuation  estimated completion date at date of valuation first second fourth quarter of quarter of quarter of estimated completion date n a n a third quarter of the estimated completion date of the viewsoft project has been delayed from the originally anticipated completion date due to increases in project scope  a longer testing period and transition of the development team 
the company is currently unable to determine the impact of such delays on its business  future results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with completing this project or that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop this technology 
write down of technology 
the company periodically reviews its goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if any impairment exists 
in june  the company completed its acquisition of apm ltd 
the acquired core technology consisted primarily of a java software product that would operate in a metaframe server environment 
at the time of acquisition  it was anticipated that there was a growing need and momentum in the market to develop and run java client applications 
since the acquisition  the market has not developed as anticipated 
in the second quarter of  management changed the java application server to a java performance pack product  which adds performance enhancements and management tools to other citrix products 
by the fourth quarter of  the company had developed a java performance pack and was assessing the market demand for this technology 
as of december   the company did not believe that there were sufficient projected cash flows to support the net book value of the core technology associated with the apm acquisition 
in addition  the company determined that there was no alternative future use for the acquired technology 
as a result  the company recorded a write down of million  representing the net book value of the apm core technology as of december  in july  the company completed its acquisition of vdonet corporation ltd 
the acquired core technology consisted primarily of the ica video services project which allowed video applications and applications containing videos to be viewed on an ica client 
subsequent development efforts resulted in the videoframe product  which was shipped in the third quarter of  but has resulted in few sales to end users 
since the acquisition  the company has explored alternative uses for the acquired technology 
by the third quarter of  the company was exploring uses related primarily to delivering video applications in a server based computing environment and video streaming with ica devices 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed potential modifications to its cash flow projections based on alternative uses for the technology 
as a result of its evaluation  the company did not believe that there were sufficient projected cash flows to support the carrying value of the core technology 
as a result  the company recorded a write down of million  representing the net book value of the vdonet core technology as of december  interest and other income 
the increase in interest and other income in was primarily due to the full year effect of interest earned on the invested net proceeds from the issuance of the zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures the debentures in march and interest earned from the increase in cash from operations 
in addition  other income increased as the company changed the composition of its investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of from tax exempt and taxable to predominantly taxable securities 
the increase in interest and other income in was primarily due to interest earned on the invested net proceeds from the issuance of debentures in march the company may acquire or make investments in companies it believes are related to its strategic objectives 
such investments will reduce the company s cash and or investment balances and therefore may reduce interest income 
interest expense 
the increases in interest expense in and were primarily due to interest related to the debentures issued in march income taxes 
in july  the company changed its organizational structure whereby it moved certain operational and administrative processes to overseas subsidiaries 
the restructuring resulted in foreign earnings being taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
in  the company determined that foreign earnings will be permanently reinvested overseas in order to fund the company s growth in overseas markets 
as a result of these organizational changes  the company s effective tax rate amounted to in  as compared to in and liquidity and capital resources during  the company generated positive operating cash flows of million related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for non cash items including tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million  and provisions for product returns and inventory obsolescence of million primarily due to stock rotations and the overall increase in the company s revenues 
these cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities of million for related primarily to the expenditure of million for the purchase of computer equipment  leasehold improvements and office equipment to support the company s growth and expansion  and net cash paid for acquisitions  primarily the innovex group  of million  partially offset by cash inflows from the net sale of investments totaling million 
cash used in financing activities of million related primarily to the expenditure of million for stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans and million generated from premiums charged in the sale of put warrants 
during  cash provided by operating activities of million related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for non cash items including tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of million due to increased marketing expenses  accrued taxes and royalty fees and provisions for product returns of million primarily due to stock rotation caused by the release of metaframe and the overall increase in the company s revenues 
these cash inflows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million due primarily to higher revenue levels and an increase of prepaid expenses of million due primarily to a receivable from estimated tax payments in excess of the tax liability 
cash used in investing activities of million for related primarily to the net purchases of investments of million  the net cash paid for the acquisition of viewsoft of million and the expenditure of million for the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment to support the company s growth and expansion into new facilities 
cash provided by financing activities of million related primarily to the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures and million from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
at december   the company had million in cash and investments  including million in cash and cash equivalents  and million of working capital 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in investment grade  highly liquid securities to minimize interest rate risk and allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
in december  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a forward bond purchase agreement bond purchase agreement with an investment advisor 
pursuant to the bond purchase agreement  the company will purchase zero coupon bonds forward bonds from the investment advisor at certain scheduled dates pursuant to the bond purchase agreement 
the purchase price of the forward bonds will equal the expected future coupon or principal payment amounts received on six underlying corporate securities 
the corporate securities  which have an aggregate amortized cost of million at december   generally provide for semi annual interest payments and mature at various dates between december and march the forward bonds will mature on march  with an aggregate maturity value of approximately million 
the bond purchase agreement and the underlying corporate securities are classified as held to maturity  therefore  the company does not recognize changes in the fair value of these investments unless a decline in the fair value of the investments is other than temporary  in which case a loss would be recognized in earnings 
the underlying corporate securities have been pledged as security for the company s future obligations to purchase the forward bonds 
in december  the company invested million in a trust trust held by an investment advisor 
the trust primarily consists of assets which in turn invest in aaa rated zero coupon corporate securities that mature on march  with an aggregate maturity value of approximately million 
the investment advisor entered into a credit risk swap agreement with the trust which effectively increased the yield on the trust assets and for which value the trust assumed the credit risk of ten specific a rated or better companies 
the company records the investment as held to maturity zero coupon corporate securities 
the company does not recognize changes in the fair market value of these investments unless a decline in the fair value of the trust assets is other than temporary  in which case a loss would be recognized in earnings 
at december   the company had million in accounts receivable  net of allowances  and million of deferred revenues  of which the company anticipates million will be earned over the next months 
on april   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock

on august   the company entered into an agreement  as amended  with a counterparty in a private transaction to purchase up to approximately million shares of the company s common stock at various times through the third quarter of pursuant to the terms of the agreement  million was paid to the counterparty in the third quarter of the ultimate number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions 
as of december   the company received  shares under this agreement at an average price of per share 
these shares have been recorded as treasury stock 
in connection with the company s stock repurchase program  in october  the board of directors approved a program authorizing the company to sell put warrants that entitle the holder of each warrant to sell to the company  generally by physical delivery  one share of the company s common stock at a specified price 
the company has engaged in various put warrant transactions that expire on various dates between january and march and have exercise prices ranging from to 
as of december   the company sold million put warrants at an average strike price of and received proceeds of million 
as of december   the company has a total potential repurchase obligation of approximately million associated with the outstanding put warrants  of which million is classified as a put warrants obligation on the balance sheet 
in october  the board of directors approved a program authorizing the company to repurchase up to million of the debentures in open market purchases 
as of december   none of the company s debentures had been repurchased under this program 
in february  the company completed its acquisition of all of the operating assets of innovex group  inc for approximately million  of which million was paid in cash at the closing date 
the balance is payable  in equal installments  and months after the closing date  contingent upon future events 
the company believes existing cash and investments together with cash flow expected from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditures requirements through the company may from time to time seek to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
the company may also acquire or make investments in companies it believes are related to its strategic objectives 
such investments may reduce the company s available working capital 
certain factors which may affect future results the company s operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance upon strategic relationship with microsoft microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems 
the company depends upon the license of key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses and technical support 
the company also depends upon its strategic alliance agreement with microsoft pursuant to which the company and microsoft have agreed to cooperate to develop advanced operating systems and promote windows application program interfaces 
the company s relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties competition with microsoft 
windows server operating systems are  and future product offerings by microsoft may be  competitive with the company s current metaframe products  and any future product offerings by the company 
expiration of microsoft s endorsement of the ica protocol 
microsoft s obligation to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred method to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows clients expired in november microsoft may now market or endorse other methods to provide multi user windows access to non windows client devices 
dependence on microsoft for commercialization 
the company s ability to successfully commercialize certain of its metaframe products depends on microsoft s ability to market windows server operating systems products 
the company does not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to the company s knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
product release delays 
there may be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of windows server operating systems 
termination of development agreement obligations 
the company s development agreement with microsoft expires in may upon expiration  microsoft may change its windows nt  terminal server edition or windows products to render them inoperable with the company s metaframe product offerings 
further  upon termination of the development agreement  microsoft may facilitate the ability of third parties to compete with the company s metaframe products 
finally  future product offerings by microsoft do not need to provide for interoperability with the company s products 
the lack of interoperability between present or future microsoft products and the company s products could cause a material adverse effect in the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence upon broad based acceptance of ica protocol the company believes that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its ability to make ica protocol a widely accepted standard for supporting windows and unix applications 
if another standard emerges or if the company otherwise fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows or unix applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft includes as a component of windows server operating systems its remote desktop protocol rdp  which has certain of the capabilities of the company s ica protocol  and may offer customers a competitive solution 
the company believes that its success is dependent on its ability to enhance and differentiate its ica protocol  and foster broad acceptance of the ica protocol based on its performance  scalability  reliability and enhanced features 
in addition  the company s ability to win broad market acceptance of its ica protocol will depend upon the degree of success achieved by its strategic partners in marketing their respective platforms  product pricing and customers assessment of its technical  managerial service and support expertise 
if another standard emerges or if the company fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows and unix applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon strategic relationships in addition to its relationship with microsoft  the company has strategic relationships with ibm  compaq  hewlett packard and others 
the company depends upon its strategic partners to successfully incorporate the company s technology into their products and to market and sell such products 
if the company is unable to maintain its current strategic relationships or develop additional strategic relationships  or if any of its key strategic partners are unsuccessful at incorporating the company s technology into their products or marketing or selling such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive 
most of its competitors and potential competitors  including microsoft  have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
the announcement of the release and the actual release of products competitive with the company s existing and future product lines  such as windows server operating systems and related enhancements  could cause existing and potential customers of the company to postpone or cancel plans to license the company s products 
this would adversely impact the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company s ability to market ica  metaframe and other future product offerings may be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices implementing the company s product offerings  which attach to windows server operating systems 
in addition  alternative products exist for web applications in the internet software market that directly or indirectly compete with the company s products 
existing or new products that extend internet software to provide database access or interactive computing can materially impact the company s ability to sell its products in this market 
as markets for the company s products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries  may enter the markets in which the company competes and further intensify competition 
finally  although the company believes that price has historically been a less significant competitive factor than product performance  reliability and functionality  the company believes that price competition may become more significant in the future 
the company may not be able to maintain its historic prices  and any inability to do so could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
the company s efforts to protect its proprietary technology rights may not be successful 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  tradename  or copyright could have a material adverse effect on the company 
despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to obtain and use information regarded as proprietary 
a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from the licensing of its packaged products under shrink wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic licensing agreements that may be unenforceable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the company s ability to protect its proprietary rights may be affected by the following differences in international law 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
third party infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
this may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such third parties 
such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
product concentration the company anticipates that its metaframe product line and related enhancements will constitute the majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to generate revenue from its metaframe product will depend upon market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines in demand for products based on metaframe technology may occur as a result of new competitive product releases  price competition  new products or updates to existing products  lack of success of the company s strategic partners  technological change or other factors 
dependence on key personnel the company s success will depend  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship at any time 
the effective management of the company s anticipated growth will depend  in a large part  upon the company s ability to i retain its highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel  and ii to attract and maintain replacements for and additions to such personnel in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense and may affect the company s ability to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
new products and technological change the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements these market characteristics will require the company to continually enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
additionally  the company and others may announce new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
the company believes it will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the development  licensing or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to existing products 
this will increase the company s cost of revenues and operating expenses 
the company cannot currently quantify such increase with respect to transactions that have not occurred 
the company may use a substantial portion of its cash and investments to fund these additional costs 
the company may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies and to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
if the company is unable to add the necessary staff and resources  future enhancement and additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential for undetected errors despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  new products may contain errors after commencement of commercial shipments 
additionally  the company s products depend upon certain third party products  which may contain defects and could reduce the performance of the company s products or render them useless 
since the company s products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in the company s products or the products of third parties upon which the company s products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by the company s customers 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company does not control its distributors and resellers 
additionally  the company s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from the company and may also represent other lines of products 
need to expand channels of distribution the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its ability to reach large enterprise customers by adding channel partners and expanding its offering of consulting services 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce the company s profits 
need to attract large enterprise customers the company intends to expand its ability to reach large enterprise customers by adding channel partners and expanding its offering of consulting services 
the company s inability to attract large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact the company s revenues 
further  as the company attempts to attract large enterprise customers  it may need to increase corporate branding activities  which will increase the company s operating expenses  but may not proportionally increase its operating revenues 
maintenance of growth rate the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the levels attained in recent years 
the company s growth during recent years is largely attributable to the introduction of metaframe for windows in mid and winframe in late to the extent revenue growth continues  the company believes that its cost of revenues and certain operating expenses will also increase 
due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  its income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease as a percentage of revenues in in process research and development valuation the company has in the past re evaluated the amounts charged to in process research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing arrangements 
the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission or the accounting profession 
any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission  may materially adversely affect future results of operations through increased amortization expense 
role of mergers and acquisitions acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired entity  which may result in unexpected dilution to the company s earnings 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that the company s previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company must also focus on its ability to manage and integrate any such acquisition 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
revenue recognition process the company continually re evaluates its programs  including specific license terms and conditions  to market its current and future products and services 
the company may implement new programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to its current and future product lines 
the company may recognize revenues associated with such enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or over the product s life cycle 
the company has implemented a new licensing model associated with the release of a new product in the company may implement a different licensing model  in certain circumstances  which would result in the recognition of licensing fees over a longer period  which may result in decreasing revenue 
the timing of the implementation of such programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements and other factors will impact the timing of the company s recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with its products  related enhancements and services 
as a result of these factors  the company currently cannot quantify the impact of the re evaluation of its programs on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
product returns and price reductions the company provides certain of its distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product evaluation 
the company also provides certain of its distributors with price protection rights 
to cover these product returns and price protections  the company has established reserves based on its evaluation of historical trends and current circumstances 
these reserves may not be sufficient to cover product returns and price protections in the future  in which case the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
international operations the company s continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
such international operations are subject to certain risks  such as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  dependence on independent distributors and resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic and political conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
volatility of stock price the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of the common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue or earnings growth  analyst reports or recommendations and other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock  regardless of the company s actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions the demand for the company s products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s short and long term investments with various financial institutions are subject to risks inherent with fluctuations in general economic and market conditions 
such fluctuations could cause an adverse effect in the value of such investments and could even result in a total loss of certain of the company s investments 
a total loss of one or more investments could result in a material adverse effect in the company s financial position 
management of growth and higher operating expenses the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations  the number of its employees and the geographic area of its operations 
in addition  the company has completed certain domestic and international acquisitions 
such growth and assimilation of acquired operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
the company believes that it has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions 
however  its systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support its current or future operations 
in addition  the company may not be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for its products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its expanding product line  expand its sales and marketing organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed product 
the company plans to increase its professional staff during as it expands sales  marketing and support and product development efforts  as well as associated administrative systems  to support planned growth 
as a result of this planned growth in the size of its staff  the company believes that it may require additional domestic and international facilities during although the company believes that the cost of such additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or results of operations  the company anticipates that operating expenses will increase during as a result of its planned growth in staff 
such an increase in operating expenses may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially 
the company maintains a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in the company s investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
a substantial majority of the company s overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  euros  swiss francs  and australian dollars 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  the company has established a hedging program 
the company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge certain firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
the company s hedging program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the company s hedging portfolio as of december  this analysis indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of the company s forward contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would decrease the fair value of the company s forward contracts by million 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact to its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts 
these estimates are not necessarily indicative of future performance  and actual results may differ materially
