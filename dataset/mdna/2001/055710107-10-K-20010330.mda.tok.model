factors that may affect our performance inflation most of the company s products are purchased in finished form and packaged by the supplier or at the company s headquarters 
the company anticipates usual inflationary increases in the price of its products and does not intend to pass these increases along to its customers  primarily as a result of other operating efficiencies gained through changing the sourcing of certain of its products 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality the company believes that its business follows seasonal trends due to the closing of some associated center dental offices in july and august  and again in november and december  for vacations 
as a result  the company s sales performance could potentially be affected

actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company believes that many of the risks set forth here and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our likelihood of success 
we have only manufactured and distributed our bs since november and our bs since november we opened our first britesmile center in walnut creek  california in february  and britesmile associated centers began performing teeth whitening procedures in april therefore  we have a limited relevant operating history upon which to evaluate the likelihood of our success 
investors must evaluate the likelihood of our success in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the operation and expansion of a new business and the development and marketing of new products 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our failure to address any of these risks or difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have a history of losses and accumulated deficit and this trend of losses may continue in the future 
for the transition period ended december  we had a net loss of approximately million  and for the full fiscal year ended april  we had a net loss of approximately  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  our ability to reach and sustain profitability will depend  in part  upon the successful marketing of our existing services and products and the successful and timely introduction of new services and products 
we anticipate that net losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
we can give no assurances that we will achieve profitability or  if achieved  that we will sustain profitability 
our success will depend on acceptance of our latw process and post whitening maintenance products 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our latw procedures  a relatively new teeth whitening concept for consumers 
we have also begun to market britesmile brand toothpaste  electric toothbrushes and post whitening procedure touchup kits through our centers and associated centers 
we expect to add other oral care accessories under the britesmile brand name to our line of retail products  including mouthwash  toothbrushes  chewing gum  travel kits and breath mints 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully encourage consumers  dentists and dental office employees to switch from traditional and less expensive bleaching tray whitening methods to our latw system  and on our ability to successfully market our line of post whitening maintenance products 
there can be no assurance that consumers will accept our procedure or products 
typically  medical and dental insurance policies do not cover teeth whitening procedures  including the company s latw procedure  or whitening maintenance products  which may have an adverse impact upon the market acceptance of our products and services 
our success will depend on our ability to update our technology to remain competitive 
the dental device and supply industry is subject to technological change 
as technological changes occur in the marketplace  we may have to modify our products in order to become or remain competitive or to ensure that our products do not become obsolete 
while we are continuing our research and development efforts to improve our current latw systems in order to strengthen our competitive advantage  we cannot assure that we will successfully implement design or technological improvements to our latw systems on a timely basis  or at all 
if we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to government requirements  market trends or customer demands  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and profit margins may decline which could adversely affect our cash flows  liquidity and operating results 
we may have problems financing our future growth 
our growth strategy includes investment in and expansion of centers and associated centers throughout the united states and internationally  increasing awareness of the britesmile brand and developing and marketing our brand name retail products 
to finance our prior growth we have sold debt and equity securities  however  additional funds are needed in the future for continued expansion 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if needed funds are not available  we may be required to close existing centers  and or limit or forego the establishment of new centers or associated centers and the development of new products  or limit the scope of our current operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be required to take other actions that may lessen the value of our common stock  including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 
raising the needed funds through the sale of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock may result in dilution to current stockholders 
we are subject to competition 
the market for teeth whitening products and services is highly competitive 
competition in the market for teeth whitening products and services may intensify in the future 
numerous well established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  operational and marketing resources 
teeth whitening products and services offered by our competitors include traditional and often less expensive bleaching tray methods and other forms of heat or light activated curing methods 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors in developing  marketing and distributing our services and products  which could result in the loss of customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitive pressures may also force prices for teeth whitening services down and such price reductions may adversely affect our potential future revenue 
we are susceptible to product liability suits and if a lawsuit is brought against us it could result in us having to pay large legal expenses and or judgments 
although no lawsuits have been filed against the company relating to our products or services  because of the nature of the dental device industry  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future 
our products come into contact with vulnerable areas of the human body  such as the mouth  tongue  teeth and gums  and  therefore  the sale and support of dental products makes us susceptible to the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim or claim arising as a result of use of our products or services brought against us  or the negative publicity brought up by such claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of  per occurrence and  per year 
while we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage that is reasonable and customary for our business  we cannot assure that the amount of insurance will be adequate to satisfy claims made against us in the future  or that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
future growth may place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
if we grow as expected  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources may occur 
further  as the number of our centers  associated centers  customers  advertisers and other business partners grows  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various associated center dentists  customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
future growth or increase in the number of our strategic relationships may strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  thereby inhibiting our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan 
in addition  our future success will also depend on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization and our support organization commensurate with the growth of our business 
we may experience shortages of the supplies we need because we do not have long term agreements with suppliers 
our success depends to a large degree on our ability to provide our affiliated dentists with our latw systems  and a sufficient supply of teeth whitening gels and maintenance products 
since our bs was first used commercially  we have relied upon manufacturing and supply agreements with multiple suppliers and a single manufacturer of our latw systems  boyd industries in tampa florida 
effective april   the company s latw systems will be manufactured by peak industries  frederick  colorodo  pursuant to a new agreement between the company and peak 
evl will finance the company s purchase of the latw systems  and will then lease the latw systems to the company pursuant to the evl lease line agreement described above under item recent business developments  evl lease agreement 
we anticipate that there may be an approximate two to three weeks delay in april between the date of final shipments of latw devices produced by our current manufacturer  and shipments of latw devices manufactured by peak 
any such delays could delay receipt of revenues from associated centers who receive systems from the new manufacturer 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurance of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
while we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and our manufacturer  if we are unable to extend or secure manufacturing services or to obtain component parts or finished products from one or more key vendors on a timely basis and on acceptable commercial terms  our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we need to successfully manage our growth in order for the addition of any new britesmile centers and associated centers to be profitable 
even though we have grown significantly in the past two years in terms of numbers of centers and associated centers opened and in operation  we may not be able to achieve profitable operations at the centers 
we currently have centers in operation 
we have no current plans to open additional centers 
successful introduction of any new centers is subject to  among other things  securing suitable sites on satisfactory terms  hiring  training and retaining qualified dentists  support staff and other personnel  having adequate capital resources and successfully integrating new centers into existing operations 
it is possible that any new centers  if opened  will not achieve sales levels comparable to existing centers 
our future growth primarily depends upon expansion of the number of our associated centers 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in expanding the number of associated centers  or that such associated centers will achieve sales levels satisfactory to us 
a large volume of sales of our common stock resulting from the conversion of notes and or the exercise of warrants and subsequent resales of those shares  may result in downward pressure or increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock 
because we have registered for resale the shares of common stock issued upon the conversion in december of  in principal amount of notes originally granted in june and august  and registered for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants granted in june and august  the holders thereof who are not in positions of control or management with the company may sell without regard to any volume restrictions  including the volume restrictions set forth in rule promulgated under the securities act 
as a result  resales by the holders of the notes and the warrants could lead to an excess supply of shares of our common stock being sold which could  in turn  result in downward pressure or increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock 
britesmile has certain debt 
britesmile has  of debt outstanding as of december  the degree to which britesmile is leveraged could have important consequences to the shareholders  including the following 
britesmile s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  
britesmile must pay interest on its debt  leaving less funds for other purposes  
britesmile may be at a competitive disadvantage to its less leveraged competitors  and 
britesmile may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 
if britesmile were to default on its debt obligations for any reason  there can be no assurance that any assets will remain for britesmile s shareholders after payment of amounts owed to debt holders 
britesmile does not intend to pay dividends 
britesmile does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock to its shareholders for the foreseeable future 
britesmile intends to retain future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of its business 
in addition  it is possible that any debt financing agreements entered into by britesmile in the future may contain restrictions on britesmile s ability to declare dividends 
we cannot guarantee that the patents we have applied for will be granted  or that even if granted  they will not be infringed by competitors 
in addition to the company s patent which was granted in january  we have filed several patent applications related to the latw systems which are currently pending  including applications related to the composition of our whitening gel  tissue isolation barriers useful in light activated teeth whitening  our business method and our unique system of delivery of light to all teeth simultaneously 
in addition  we have ongoing research and development efforts to improve and expand our current technology  and to develop new teeth whitening compositions and light devices 
although we intend to continue to apply for patents as advised by patent counsel  there can be no assurance that such patents will be issued or that  when they are issued  they will not be infringed upon by third parties or that they will cover all aspects of the product or system to which they relate 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products and services may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products and services 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for additional patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states or in foreign jurisdictions 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
our products or services could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products or services 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products or services infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we are not aware of any infringement or other intellectual property claims asserted or threatened against us by others 
we are subject to government regulation regarding the corporate practice of dentistry 
our corporate structure  operation of centers and contractual relationships with the licensed dentists at our centers are subject to government regulation and may be reviewed by applicable state agencies governing the practice of dentistry such as a board of dental examiners 
we believe that our present and contemplated operation of centers is and will be in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  and that favorable review of our corporate structure would be obtained from any state agency which chooses to review our operational structure 
however  we cannot assure that such favorable review would be obtained in all instances 
if we are unable to obtain favorable review  we may be subject to penalties 
further  if we are unable to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in any state  we may be limited in those states to offering our latw procedure through associated centers 
we continue to cooperate with state regulatory agencies to respond to any requests for information about our business structure and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals 
we cannot assure that future enactments  amendments or interpretations of government regulations will not be more stringent  and will not require structural  organizational or operational modifications to our existing or future contractual relationships with the licensed dentists at our centers who provide our services 
we may become subject to government regulation regarding our teeth whitening services and products 
the light used in the latw systems is categorized as a class i medical device as defined by the food and drug administration fda 
as long as the light is used specifically to perform cosmetic dental procedures teeth whitening  it is not subject to pre market notification requirements  although we are subject to fda requirements regarding handling of complaints and other general fda record keeping standards 
there can be no assurance that some or all of the existing government regulations will not change significantly or adversely in the future  or that we will not become subject to compliance with additional and stricter government regulations which could  in the future  affect our potential future revenue 
ownership of our common stock is concentrated in a limited number of shareholders 
current directors and executive officers of the company  or their affiliates  own and control approximately of our company and  therefore  have ultimate authority to make all major decisions affecting our business  including the identity and make up of our board of directors  and any other matters requiring approval of the shareholders of the company 
our efforts to build strong brand identity and customer loyalty may not be successful 
we believe that establishing and maintaining brand identity and brand loyalty is critical to attracting customers  dentists and other strategic partners 
in order to attract and retain these groups  and respond to competitive pressures  we intend to continue substantial spending to create and maintain brand loyalty 
we believe that advertising rates  and the cost of advertising campaigns in particular  could increase substantially in the future 
if our branding efforts are not successful  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
promotion and enhancement of the britesmile brand will also depend on our success in consistently providing a high quality customer experience for our teeth whitening services and satisfaction with our products 
if customers do not perceive our service and product offerings to be of high quality  or if we introduce new services and products that are not favorably received by these groups  the value of the britesmile brand could be harmed 
any brand impairment or dilution could decrease the attractiveness of britesmile to one or more of these groups which could harm our reputation  reduce our net revenue and cause us to lose customers 
failures in our information technology systems or the systems of third parties could adversely affect our business and result in a loss of customers 
our company s web site or our internet based scheduler system may experience slow response times  decreased capacity to accommodate a large number of customers or a temporary disruption in service for a variety of reasons 
additionally  power outages and delays in such service may interrupt or prevent us from immediately coordinating with the schedules of centers and associated centers  and may interrupt or prevent customers from arranging for our services or from ordering our products through our e commerce internet site 
any of these potential problems could have an adverse effect on business 
computer hardware and software components to our scheduler system are located at our headquarters 
in addition  a back up file server and tape back ups of the scheduler database reside both at our headquarters and off site 
delays in scheduling teeth whitening procedures would result if we were required to use our backup computer hardware and software systems 
nevertheless  natural disasters such as floods  fires  and power outages  telecommunications failures  physical or electronic break ins or vandalism  viruses and other similar events could damage our hardware and software systems  lead to a loss of data  cause substantial disruption in our business operations  and have a material adverse effect on our business
