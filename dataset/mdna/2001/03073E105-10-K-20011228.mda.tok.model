the accompanying historical consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows for fiscal and fiscal and the consolidated balance sheet as of september   reflect only the results of amerisource  as predecessor to the company 
as a result  the company s historical operating results and cash flows for fiscal and fiscal and the company s financial position as of september  are not comparable to fiscal because of the merger 
fiscal results include a full year of amerisource and approximately one month of bergen s results 
accordingly  in order to enhance comparability  the following discussion of results of operations includes pro forma revenue information 
for purposes of this discussion  pro forma refers to the combined results of amerisource and bergen in each respective fiscal year 
results of operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue  which excludes bulk deliveries  for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
excluding the revenue impact from the merger  operating revenue increased for the full fiscal year 
on a pro forma combined basis operating revenue increased versus the prior year 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
as a result of the merger  bulk deliveries increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the impact from the merger  bulk deliveries would have decreased to million for fiscal on a pro forma combined basis revenue from bulk deliveries of billion in fiscal increased versus the prior year 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 
gross profit of million in fiscal increased by as compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  the gross profit in fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the pharmaceutical distribution segment  which was offset  in part  by the impact of the inclusion of one month of pharmerica s results 
pharmerica  due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business  has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the company s pharmaceutical distribution segment 
excluding the impact of the merger  gross profit increased for the full fiscal year  and as a percentage of operating revenue was in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
distribution  selling and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization increased by million or in fiscal as compared to the prior year  and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a basis point decrease in the pharmaceutical distribution segment ratio offset in part by the inclusion of one month of pharmerica results

the company intends to reduce the number of distribution facilities from at september   to approximately over the next three to four years and has announced plans to close seven facilities in fiscal a charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to these plans  and included million of severance for approximately warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated  million in lease cancellations  and million in the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed 
accrued expenses of million related to this charge are included in the consolidated balance sheet at september  additional shut down charges for integ ration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced 
in connection with its acquisition of bergen  the company incurred merger costs of million in fiscal  consisting primarily of consulting fees of million and a million charge for the accelerated vesting of amerisource stock options 
additional merger costs  including merger integration and employee retention costs  will be charged to expense in subsequent periods when incurred 
these costs are expected to be between million and million in fiscal the company s amerisource corporation subsidiary is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations at one of its former distribution centers that may require the company to make remediation efforts 
in fiscal  the company accrued million to cover future consulting  legal  remediation and ongoing monitoring costs 
during fiscal  environmental reserves of million were reversed into income based on a new engineering analysis prepared by outside consultants that was completed in september the remaining liability of million at september   is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
this accrued liability represents the current estimate of the extent of contamination and choice of remedy based on existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
however  changes in remediation standards  improvements in cleanup technology and discovery of additional information concerning the site could affect th e estimated liability in the future 
during fiscal  severance accruals of million relating to the fiscal facility consolidation and restructuring efforts were reversed into income after employees expected to be severed either left the company before receiving their benefits or were retained in other positions within the company 
operating income of million for the year ended september  increased by from the prior year 
excluding the facility consolidations and employee severance charge  the merger costs and the environmental remediation credit special items in both years described above and the impact of the merger in fiscal  the increase in operating income was and the company s operating margin was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal equity in losses of affiliates and other were million in fiscal and million in fiscal these results primarily reflect the full year impact of the company s equity investment in healthnexis  llc that was accounted for on the equity method and the write down of the company s investment in a technology company 
healthnexis  llc subsequently merged with the global health exchange in november interest expense of million in fiscal represents an increase of compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of the merger  interest expense in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year period 
this decrease reflects the positive impact of million of fixed rate convertible notes issued by the company in december of and a decrease of approximately basis points in average borrowing rates under the company s variable rate debt facilities  which more than offset the increase in average levels of debt 
excluding the impact of the merger and the related refinancings described below  average borrowings during the year ended september  were million as compared to average borrowings of million in the prior year 
income tax expense of million in fiscal reflected an effective tax rate of versus in the prior fiscal year 
this slight increase in the effective rate reflects the inclusion of one month of bergen s operating results 
the company expects the effective tax rate to be between and in fiscal as a result of the merger 
net income of million represents an increase of over the prior year 
excluding special items in both years  adjusted net income of million increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
diluted earnings per share increased to per share as compared to per share in the prior year 
diluted earnings per share excluding special items increased to per share as compared to per share in the prior year 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal includes the impact of the shares issued to effect the merger and the shares assumed issued under the convertible subordinated notes 
segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment operating revenue for the pharmaceutical distribution segment for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year 
excluding the impact of the merger  operating revenue increased 
during the year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and the remaining was from retail customers 
in fiscal  the customer mix was institutional and retail 
during the year ended september   sales to institutional customers increased and sales to retail customers increased 
excluding the impact of the merger  institutional operating revenue increased and retail operating revenue increased 
the increase in institutional operating revenue was primarily due to revenue growth with the novation group purchasing organization gpo and the veterans administration as well as significant increases in the alternate site customer group 
during calendar  members of the novation gpo went through a distributor selection process and  as a result  the company added over million in annualized operating revenue in fiscal operating revenue from the veterans administration accounted for approximately of total institutional operating revenue 
alternate site sales increased during fiscal due to the full year impact of a mail order customer added in the third quarter of the prior year which accounted for of the increase 
in addition  numerous new alternate site accounts were added during the year 
the increase in retail operating revenue was consistent with overall industry growth rates 
future operating revenue growth may be impacted by customer consolidation and competition within the industry  as well as industry growth rates 
in the pharmaceutical distribution segment  gross profit of million in fiscal increased by as compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  the gross profit in fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
the year to year decline reflects the net impact of a number of factors including the change in customer mix to a higher level of larger institutional  mail order and chain accounts  and the continuing competitive pricing environment  offset  in part  by higher buy side margins than in the prior year 
downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin  including manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals  will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline 
gross profit was adversely impacted in fiscal by a million write down of inventory  primarily related to the company s decision to exi t the designer fragrance business at its cosmetic distribution subsidiary 
total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased in the pharmaceutical distribution segment to million  primarily the result of the merger 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
this decrease reflects the changing customer mix described above  and efficiencies of scale  as well as the continued elimination of costs and productivity improvements throughout the company s distribution network 
total operating income before special items increased in the pharmaceutical distribution segment to million 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income before special items was in fiscal and in the prior year  reflecting the net effect of the decline in gross margins offset by the reduction in operating expenses discussed above 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so  there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins 
additionally  there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned and result in the desired synergies 
pharmerica segment the pharmerica segment was acquired in connection with the merger and its operating revenue of million and operating income of million for the year ended september  reflects approximately one month of operating results 
on a pro forma basis  pharmerica s fiscal operating revenue increased to billion from billion in the prior year

during the year ended september   sales to health systems and alternate site facilities accounted for of total operating revenue  while sales to independent community pharmacies accounted for and sales to chain drugstores accounted for of the total 
the increase in health systems revenue was primarily due to revenue growth with the veterans administration  which accounted for and of the total operating revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the balance of the health systems growth was due to growth from existing relationships with group purchasing organizations 
several new alternate site customers were added as a result of the company s sales reorganization in the prior year  which created a national and regional alternate site sales force 
approximately of the alternate site revenue growth was from a new contract with a mail order facility  which started in the third quarter of fiscal the increase in independent community pharmacy and chain drugstore revenue was consistent with overall industry growth 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products

distribution  selling and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization increased by million or in fiscal as compared to the prior year  and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement reflects the changing customer mix to more health systems business  including the veterans administration  which is lower gross margin business  but requires lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue to service 
the improvement also reflects warehouse efficiencies and cost reductions related to the company s fiscal and restructuring efforts 
these factors were offset in part by an increase in the bad debt provision to million for fiscal compared to a million provision in the prior year

in fiscal  the company reversed million of cost originally accrued during fiscal for facility consolidations and employee severance due to million of proceeds in excess of estimates for disposed assets and million of severance settled for less than original estimates
