item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general emmis the company generally evaluates the performance of its operating entities based on broadcast cash flow bcf and publishing cash flow pcf 
management believes that bcf and pcf are useful because they provide a meaningful comparison of operating performance between companies in the industry and serve as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations or publishing entities 
bcf and pcf are generally recognized by the broadcast and publishing industries as a measure of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcasting and publishing groups 
bcf and pcf do not take into account emmis debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  bcf and pcf are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in emmis business or other discretionary uses 
bcf and pcf are not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
moreover  bcf and pcf are not standardized measures and may be calculated in a number of ways 
emmis defines bcf and pcf as revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses 
the primary source of broadcast advertising revenues is the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers 
publishing entities derive revenue from subscriptions and sale of print advertising 
the most significant broadcast operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with programming  advertising and promotion  and station general and administrative costs 
significant publishing operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  costs associated with producing the magazine  and general and administrative costs 
the company s revenues are affected primarily by the advertising rates its entities charge 
these rates are in large part based on the entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
broadcast entities ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron radio market reports for radio stations and by ac nielsen company for television stations 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  the company s strategy is to use market research and advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services which can be used by the station in its business operations 
the company generally confines the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which the company would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is the company s general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade

liquidity and capital resources capital requirements our primary uses of capital have been historically  and are expected to continue to be  funding acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and debt and preferred stock service requirements 
emmis is constructing new operating facilities for wala tv in mobile  alabama 
the project is expected to be completed in december of for an estimated cost of million of which million has been incurred through february   and this project will be financed through cash flows from operating activities and or borrowings under the credit facility 
capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended february  and  we had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily related to the indianapolis office facility project  the khon operating facilities project  leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases and tower upgrades 
we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business  including costs related to our conversion to digital television 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements as of february   we had billion of corporate indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility billion and senior subordinated notes billion  and an additional million of other indebtedness 
we also had million of our preferred stock outstanding 
see sources of liquidity for discussion of our senior discount notes offering in march all outstanding amounts under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate or an alternative base rate plus a margin the margin  which ranges from to  varies based on our ratio of total debt to operating cash flow 
as of february   our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facility was approximately 
based on amounts currently outstanding under our senior subordinated notes and convertible preferred stock  the debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements for the next twelve month period are million and million  respectively 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and funds available under our credit facility 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
on march   we received million of proceeds from the issuance of senior discount notes due  less approximately million of debt issuance costs 
the notes accrete interest at a rate of per year  compounded semi annually to an aggregate principle amount of million on march  commencing on september   interest is payable in cash on each march and september a portion of the net proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of three radio stations in phoenix  arizona and the remaining net proceeds approximately million were placed in escrow to ultimately reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the senior discount notes will automatically be exchanged for exchangeable pik preferred stock unless we can effect a corporate reorganization by july  under this reorganization  we will transfer all of our assets  as well as our obligations under the credit facility and the senior subordinated notes  to a wholly owned subsidiary  emmis operating company 
emmis communications corporation will still be the issuer of our class a  class b and class c common stock  our convertible preferred stock and the senior discount notes  and emmis operating company will be the obligor of the senior subordinated notes 
we do not expect the reorganization  which should be completed before the july  deadline  to materially affect our operations because we currently conduct substantially all of our business through subsidiaries 
at april   we have million available under our credit facility  less million in outstanding letters of credit 
we expect that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to fund all working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  and preferred stock dividend requirements for the forseeable future 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio and television stations as well as publishing properties 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
on march   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of radio stations ktar am  kmvp am and kklt fm in phoenix  arizona from hearst argyle television  inc for million in cash

the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
intangibles at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio and television stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and broadcast cash flow 
this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
finally  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered calendar years 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage this exposure emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended in june of by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these statements  which are effective for emmis on march   establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
these statements require that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction  and on the type of hedge transaction 
gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in the other comprehensive income must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current period 
these new standards will result in additional volatility in reported assets  liabilities  earnings and other comprehensive income 
sfas no 
requires that as of the date of initial adoption the difference between the fair value of the derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb accounting changes 
on march   emmis recorded the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in an immaterial impact to the results of operations and the financial position of emmis 
sfas no 
further requires that the fair value and effectiveness of each hedging instrument must be measured quarterly 
the result of each measurement could result in fluctuations in reported assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income and earnings as these changes in fair value and effectiveness are recorded to the financial statements 
emmis anticipates  on an ongoing basis  the fluctuations to the aforementioned areas will be immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole 
interest rates at february   the entire outstanding balance under our credit facility  or approximately of our total outstanding debt credit facility and senior subordinated debt bears interest at variable rates 
emmis currently hedges a portion of its outstanding debt with interest rate swap arrangements that effectively set the credit facility s underlying base rate at a weighted average rate of on the three month libor for agreements in place as of february  the credit facility requires the company to have fixed interest rates for a two year period on at least of its total outstanding debt  as defined including the senior subordinated debt  by june  after the first two years  this ratio of fixed to floating rate debt must be maintained if emmis total leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than at any quarter end 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements at february  totaled million  and the agreements expire february based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt were to increase by  our annual interest expense would be higher by million 
foreign currency emmis owns a interest in a hungarian subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency forint 
emmis has a natural hedge since some of the subsidiary s long term obligations are denominated in hungarian forints 
emmis maintains no other derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the hungarian forint would not be material 
emmis owns a interest in an argentinean subsidiary which is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
this subsidiary s operations are measured in its local currency peso  which is tied to the us dollar through the argentine government s convertibility plan 
emmis maintains no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
