item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared with sales decreased to million weeks from million weeks in plymouth tapes sales of million were down from sales in the automotive market decreased approximately  largely due to weak fourth quarter sales 
sales in all other markets combined increased  partially offsetting the automotive decrease 
sales at brite line technologies decreased to  from  in  largely due to lower than expected reorder business  unacceptable pricing in europe due to currency exchange rates  and unfavorable spring weather conditions in certain key market regions 
gross margin decreased to from in plymouth tapes gross margin decreased to from in the major factor driving this decrease was rising raw material purchase prices during fiscal  primarily for pvc resins  which increased product costs significantly compared to  and which the company was largely unable to pass along to customers 
the resultant margin decrease is estimated to be  for the year 
another factor was extensive time during july and early august that was necessary to install and debug capital equipment additions and improvements 
the resultant low production output produced a large overhead absorption variance  estimated at approximately  lower direct labor utilization  and lower sales due to the temporary inability to produce certain products 
overall processing yields were also significantly unfavorable compared to last year  and were a significant contributor to the lower gross margin 
one large component of the lower processing yields was the installation and startup costs for certain coating equipment 
in addition  manufacturing costs were higher for certain automotive products  due to product development activities 
increases were also experienced in indirect labor  equipment repair  healthcare  and utility costs 
lower contractual selling prices  mainly to a major automotive customer  also contributed approximately  to the margin decrease  as did unfavorable european pricing caused by currency exchange rates 
slightly offsetting this was the gross margin at brite line technologies  which increased to from in selling  general and administrative expenses are incurred and recorded in both plymouth tapes and brite line technologies 
certain of the selling  general and administrative expenses recorded in plymouth tapes could be considered as incurred for the benefit of brite line  but are currently not allocated to that segment 
these expenses include certain management  accounting  personnel and sales services  and a limited amount of travel  insurance  directors fees and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in the major source of the decrease was brite line technologies  where selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from last year

salaries in brite line technologies also decreased by approximately  due in large part to a reduction in accrued bonuses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  in plymouth tapes decreased slightly to from last year 
the major factor reducing expenses was a  decrease in bonus and profit sharing 
there was also a  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in advertising 
these decreases were largely offset by a  increase in environmental expenses  an increase in salary and fringe of  a freight expense increase of  and a bad debt expense increase of  operating income for included an insurance settlement with one of the company s previous liability insurance carriers 
under the terms of the agreement  the insurance carrier made a one time payment of  in exchange for a release of all past  present  and future environmental claims 
interest expense increased to  from  last year 
the increase occurred because of both higher average loan balances approximately  higher and higher interest rates approximately higher on the revolving line of credit in compared to this was partially offset by slightly lower average balances for term debt 
as a result of the above factors  income before taxes in decreased to a loss of  compared to a profit of  in fiscal results benefited from a one time insurance recovery of  and were adversely affected by  in expense connected with patent litigation 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  management performed an analysis of the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
fas requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by  such an increase was deemed necessary as the net deferred tax asset balance at december  could not be carried back to recover taxes paid in previous years and will not be offset by the reversal of future taxable differences 
also  the company s liquidity situation at december  provides significant negative evidence regarding the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to recover these assets 
the increase in the valuation allowance resulted in a  tax expense for fiscal  compared to a  tax expense in net income for fiscal decreased to a loss of  compared to a profit of  in cash generated from operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the major factors contributing to cash from operating activities included depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income tax expense of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in environmental reserves of million  and a decrease in other assets of million

the operating cash flow and cash provided through additional borrowings totaling million under the company s revolving line of credit  and million under a capital expenditure line of credit were used to finance capital expenditures of million  pay off or reduce term debt and capital leases of million  and repurchase plymouth rubber common stock in the amount of million 
the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in income currently 
the company operates a wholly owned subsidiary in spain  which accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal the functional currency of this subsidiary is the peseta 
changes in the peseta exchange rate could affect the reporting of the subsidiary s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations

at the end of fiscal  there were no forward contracts in place 
compared with sales increased for the ninth consecutive year  as sales at million were up from the major contributor was plymouth tapes  where sales of million were up from increased capacity in the canton plant allowed the company to meet increasing customer demand 
sales in the automotive market were particularly strong  as sales increased from levels and accounted for most of the growth 
sales in all other markets increased  as increases in domestic markets were mostly offset by weakness in markets outside the us brite line technologies also contributed to growth  as sales of million were up over gross margin increased to from last year 
plymouth tapes gross margin increased to from in the major factor in the improvement was higher production volume in the canton operations to meet increased sales demand and build inventories 
this was partially offset by higher raw material purchase prices and higher levels of manufacturing spending 
brite line technologies gross margin increased to from in  due to better pricing and higher volume  partially offset by higher manufacturing spending and raw material usage 
selling  general and administrative expenses were incurred and recorded in both plymouth tapes and brite line technologies 
certain of the selling  general and administrative expenses recorded in plymouth tapes could have been considered as incurred for the benefit of brite line  but were not allocated to that segment 
these expenses included certain management  accounting  personnel and sales services  and a limited amount of travel  insurance  directors fees and other expenses

under the terms of the agreement  the insurance carrier made a one time payment of  in exchange for a release of all past  present  and future environmental claims 
interest expense in increased to  from  in the increase occurred largely in the first half of  due to increased long term borrowings to finance capital investments  as well as higher balances on the revolving line of credit  to finance operations and some capital improvements 
during the second half of  interest expense was approximately level with last year 
although the average second half borrowing balances for both long term debt and the revolving line of credit were higher in compared to  the interest rates applied to the revolving line of credit and the real estate portion of the long term debt were lower in compared to the lower interest rates were a result of a new loan agreement with plymouth s primary lender  effective june  as a result of the above factors  income before tax increased to  from  in excluding the one time insurance settlement  income before tax increased 
the effective tax rate in increased to from in the major factor in the difference occurred during  which benefited from investment tax credits generated by the more than million of capital equipment placed in service during that year

cash generated from operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the major factors contributing to cash from operating activities included net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and deferred income tax expense of million  partially offset by a million increase in inventory 
inventory was increased to better respond to customer demand in plymouth tapes  prepare for certain canton plant equipment installations during the first quarter of fiscal  and to support higher levels of activity in brite line technologies 
the operating cash flow and cash provided through additional borrowings totaling million under the company s revolving line of credit  million under a capital expenditure line of credit  and million from sale leaseback of equipment  were used to finance capital expenditures of million  pay off or reduce term debt and capital leases of million  and repurchase plymouth rubber common stock in the amount of million 
liquidity and capital resources during    and  plymouth rubber invested in a significant capital expansion and improvement program  for a total amount of million  including a new calender and coating line  and other production equipment  which substantially increased its production capacity 
at the end of fiscal and the beginning of  the company also invested in new subsidiaries brite line technologies  inc  and plymouth rubber europa  sa in connection with these investments and to provide working capital for operations  the company has increased its debt from approximately million in to approximately million in as of december   the company had used all of its borrowing capacity under its line of credit with its primary lender  after consideration of collateral limitations and the letter of credit related to a guarantee of million pesetas approximately million on a term loan agreement with a spanish bank syndicate 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with two of its financial covenants minimum working capital and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio with its primary term debt lender 
because of a cross default provision  the company was therefore also not in compliance with a covenant with its primary working capital lender 
as a result  the million long term portion of debt with these lenders has been classified as current on the company s consolidated balance sheet  and the total debt with these lenders currently would be payable on demand 
this reclassification resulted in a negative working capital of  the company is projecting that it will not be in compliance with the covenants of its primary term debt and primary working capital facilities in the next twelve months 
the company expects that demands on its liquidity and credit resources will continue to be significant through fiscal in response  the company has developed a number of cash conservation plans for fiscal first  the company has negotiated modified loan agreements with its primary term lender to defer certain principal payments and extend the remaining loan amortization period by four months 
the company is currently working with another of its term lenders to negotiate a similar arrangement 
the reduced cash outflow from deferred principal payments with these two lenders would total approximately  the company is also working with its primary working capital lender to increase cash availability and or defer certain principal payments on term debt 
in addition  the company is currently working with a number of other lenders to obtain additional financing or refinance its existing debt 
the company has also developed plans to conserve cash  including cost reductions  inventory reductions  expense deferrals  capital expenditure reductions  incentive compensation reductions  and certain delayed payments 
in the opinion of management  and based upon the plans above  anticipated cash flow from operations  and from existing  renegotiated  refinanced  and or additional debt facilities  cash conservation measures  and other planned cash inflows will provide sufficient funds to meet expected needs during fiscal although management expects to be able to accomplish its plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s plans depend upon many factors  including those outlined in the safe harbor statement below 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position  and future operations 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as described above  the negative working capital position of  at december   demand status of the company s term debt facilities and the lack of borrowing capacity under the line of credit may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
environmental proceedings claims under cercla the company has been named as a potentially responsible party prp by the united states environmental protection agency epa in two ongoing claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
these cercla claims involve attempts by the epa to recover the costs associated with the cleanup of two superfund sites in southington  connecticut the solvent recovery service of new england superfund site srs site and the old southington landfill superfund site osl site 
srs was an independent and licensed solvent recycler disposal company 
the epa asserts that srs  after receiving and processing various hazardous substances from prps  shipped some resultant sludges and wastewater from the srs site to the osl site 
the company received a prp notification regarding the srs site in june  the epa originally attributed a share of the aggregate waste volume at the srs site to the company 
remedial action is ongoing at the site  and the company is a participant in the performing prp group 
largely because of orphaned and non participating parties shares  the company most recently has been contributing approximately toward the performing prp group s ongoing expenses 
to date approximately million in response costs have been spent or committed at this site 
based upon the extensive investigations and remedial actions conducted at the site to date  it is presently estimated that the total future costs at the srs site may range from approximately million to million 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december   management has accrued  as a reserve against the company s potential future liability in this matter  which is net of approximately  in payments made to date by the company 
the company received a prp notification regarding the osl site in january  in addition to numerous srs transshipper prps such as the company  the epa has named a number of other prps who allegedly shipped waste materials directly to the osl site 
based on epa s asserted volume of shipments to srs  epa originally attributed of the srs transshipper prps waste volume at the osl site to the company  which is a fraction of the undetermined total waste volume at the site 
the remediation program at the osl site has been divided into two phases  called operable units ou 
ou primarily involves capping of the site and ou is groundwater remediation  if any 
a record of decision rod was issued in september  for ou and  in december   following mediation  the company contributed  in full settlement of ou toward a total contribution by the srs transshipper prps of approximately million 
the srs transshipper prps payment of million represented approximately of the ou total settlement 
at present  neither the remedy for ou nor the allocation of the costs thereof among the prps has been determined 
whatever remedy ultimately is selected  the srs transshippers allocable share of the ou expenses likely will be greater than the paid for ou it has been estimated that the total costs of ou may range from million to million 
management has accrued  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a reserve against the company s potential future liability in this matter  which is net of approximately  in payments made to date by the company 
based on all available information as well as its prior experience  management believes that its accruals in these two matters are reasonable 
however  in each case the reserved amount is subject to adjustment for future developments that may arise from one or more of the following the long range nature of the case  legislative changes  insurance coverage  the joint and several liability provisions of cercla  the uncertainties associated with the ultimate groundwater remedy selected  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
claims under massachusetts general laws  chapter e while in the process of eliminating the use of underground storage tanks at the company s facility in canton  massachusetts  the company arranged for the testing of the areas adjacent to the tanks in question a set of five tanks in and a set of three tanks in the tests indicated that some localized contamination had occurred 
the company duly reported these findings regarding each location to the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep  and the dep has issued notices of responsibility under massachusetts general laws chapter e to the company for each location rtn no 
for the set of five tanks and rtn nos 
and for the set of three tanks 
the company has retained an independent licensed site professional lsp to perform assessment and remediation work at the two locations 
with regard to the first matter involving the set of five tanks  the lsp has determined that the contamination appears to be confined to a small area of soil and does not pose an environmental risk to surrounding property or community 
with regard to the second matter involving the set of three tanks  a limited amount of solvent has been found in the soil and groundwater in the vicinity of the tanks 
costs incurred to date in connection with these two locations have totaled approximately  these costs have been funded through operating cash flows 
it presently is estimated that the combined future costs to complete the assessment and remediation actions at the two locations will total approximately  and that amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
in january  the company received a chapter e notice of responsibility from the dep concerning two sites located in dartmouth  massachusetts rtn no 
and freetown  massachusetts rtn no 
 respectively 
according to the dep  drums containing oil and or hazardous materials were discovered at the two sites in  which led to some cleanup actions by the dep 
the dep contends that an independent disposal firm allegedly hired by the company and other prps  h m drum company  was responsible for disposing of drums at the two sites 
to date  the dep has issued notices of responsibility to approximately prps 
a group of prps  including the company  has retained an lsp to conduct subsurface investigations at both sites 
the lsp has completed limited subsurface investigations at both sites 
at the freetown site  no reportable contamination was found either in soil or groundwater  and the lsp has recommended that the dep close the site out 
at the dartmouth site  no reportable contamination was found in soil  while reportable  but lower than historical levels of contaminants were found in groundwater 
the lsp s investigation at the dartmouth site further indicates that there may be an upgradient off site source of contaminants which the company would not be responsible for that is impacting the site  and recommends further investigation into that possibility 
while the results of the limited subsurface investigations at these sites are relatively encouraging  until additional data is gathered  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs of any further investigation or cleanup that may be required at one or both sites  or the company s potential share of liability or responsibility therefor 
accordingly  no reserve has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these two sites 
in april  the company received a chapter e notice of responsibility from the dep concerning an oil release in the portion of the east branch of the neponset river that flows through the company s property in canton  massachusetts rtn no 

the company had duly reported the presence of oil in the river to the appropriate government agencies 
the company commenced cleanup and investigatory actions as soon as it became aware of the presence of the oil  and immediately retained both an lsp to oversee response actions in this matter and also an environmental services firm to perform cleanup and containment services 
at the present time  neither the source nor the cause of the release has been positively determined 
costs incurred to date have totaled approximately  these costs have been funded through operating cash flows 
it presently is estimated that the future costs in this matter will total approximately  which has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
impact of new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended  will be effective for the company as of december  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
fas requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company did not hold derivative positions at december  as such  the effect of adopting fas on the company s financial statement is not expected to be significant

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the carrying value of company s debt totaled million which approximated its fair value 
this debt includes amounts at both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt by approximately  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant
