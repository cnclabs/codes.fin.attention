item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts and where noted 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year ending total assets were more than lower because current assets declined million as a result of reduced levels of cash  inventory and receivables related to the lower sales activity  net fixed assets declined million as a result of depreciation which exceeded new purchases  and net intangible assets declined million because amortization of goodwill and intellectual property exceeded new acquisitions 
year end net intangible assets represent of total assets 
net tangible assets per nasdaq rule a is defined as total assets including the value of patents and trademarks  but excluding the value of goodwill less total liabilities 
net tangible assets at end of year were million 
excluding the possibility of new intangible assets from acquisitions  total asset productivity should continue to improve in because sales are projected to grow  while working capital remains about the same and net property plant and equipment pp e declines as depreciation exceeds the rate of new asset purchases 
net after accumulated depreciation pp e in utah and oregon decreased million  while in ireland decreased million 
consolidated pp e asset turns improved to based on year ending balances 
productivity of pp e in should continue to increase since sales are expected to increase and net pp e decrease  as consolidated new capital expenditures are expected to be less than one half of depreciation 
inventory turns increased slightly with lower sales in because average inventory dropped in from management expects to be able to achieve its objective of average inventory turns in because sales should increase without the need for a similar increase in inventories 
year ending accounts receivable a r balances declined 
calculated days in a r were within target at  based on q shipment activity 
aged a r over days from invoice date increased to about of total a r at year end from at the end of the increase in the over days receivables balance is due mainly to normally slower paying overseas distributors who were current at the end of the prior year 
the company believes these older a r are collectible 
the working capital decline of million in was the result of a reduction in current assets  as follows million cash  million a r and million inventories  with no change in current liabilities 
utmd expects to internally finance any working capital growth needed to support growth in sales activity 
b liabilities 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio was compared to at the end of the total debt ratio is defined as total liabilities  including current liabilities  deferred income taxes and the balance remaining on its unsecured line of credit used to finance share repurchases and acquisitions  divided by total assets 
two influences caused the ratio increase the year ending line of credit balance increased by million because of the third quarter tender offer in which utmd financed a million repurchase of its shares  and the million decrease in total assets 
without additional share repurchases or new acquisitions  utmd expects to significantly reduce the remaining line of credit balance in  yielding a total debt ratio below 
results of operations 
a revenues 
annual consolidated revenues declined in utmd divides its us sales into two channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers through utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are sales to other medical device companies where products are resold as part of a component of a kit or a repackaged stand alone product 
as a percentage of us sales  direct sales represented of sales compared to in  and in oem sales represented of us sales compared to in  and in global consolidated sales adds foreign sales to us sales 
in each of the three years  us direct sales represented of global consolidated sales 
foreign sales in  despite a stronger us dollar  were of global consolidated sales compared to in  and in ob gyn and neonatal product sales were of foreign sales compared to in  and in foreign sales of ob gyn and neonatal products increased  and totaled million for ireland operations shipped of foreign sales in us dollar terms in compared to in  and in in irish pound terms  shipments from utmd ltd 
ireland were up compared to the prior year 
in dollar terms  ireland shipments were up 
total foreign sales were down million because sales of the blood pressure monitoring bpm accessory products representing of foreign sales were down million  or  relative to the prior year 
utmd categorizes its sales into four product line groups obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for improving clinician safety and for ease in performing delivery procedures  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological office clinician practices  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal  comprised of devices for gaining vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  and other specialized tools used in the care of critically ill infants  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized tools for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  along with other products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
sales in the obstetrics product category decreased in and represented of total sales 
obstetrics sales were  compared to  in  and  in direct sales of the market leading iup catheter  intran r plus  declined under active competition from cheaper  less clinically effective products 
sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads decreased in  apparently due to lower utilization by us hospitals 
utmd agrees with acog the american college of obstetricians gynecologists that using vads remains the trained physician s best choice in many operative deliveries  and will increase its educational programs in gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales grew in  representing of total revenues 
gyn es uro sales were  in compared to  in  and  in a number of utmd products in this fragmented category are highly differentiated  and should continue to grow as physicians learn more about them 
year global neonatal product sales were  compared to  in  and  in neonatal product sales include the neonatal product line of gesco international acquired in july  the bard access systems bas per q cath r neonatal picc  disposa hood tm and the neonatal deltran r plus 
utmd s neonatal product sales remained about the same as primarily because sales of the per q cath r picc declined million 
the decline resulted from the fact that bas did not honor its exclusive distribution agreement with utmd for hospital nicus  which agreement was part of the gesco acquisition 
utmd believes that an effective picc is an important part of a neonatal intensive care product line  and that its new gesco picc  released for marketing by the fda at the beginning of fourth quarter  will be able to regain lost per q cath sales  and more  as a result of utmd s picc product development improvements 
bpm and accessories and other miscellaneous oem sales bpm represented of consolidated sales compared to in both and sales were  compared to  in  and  in sales declined million due to several factors relating to oem customers sales of stopcock accessories to baxter declined million  cmi subcontract molding declined million  and foreign sales of primarily flush device accessories declined million 
except for the baxter business  utmd expects its bpm sales will return to higher levels as utmd continues to enjoy a stable and significant demand for its well regarded bpm products  particularly overseas 
b gross profits 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus remaining after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from net revenues  was a company record compared to in  and in the gpm was the previous record 
gross margin improvements were led by process experience  product design improvements  better materials management and better utilization of overhead costs 
utmd management believes that achieving an average gpm about is necessary to successfully support the significant sales and marketing  research and development  and administrative expenses associated with a growth company in a highly complex and competitive marketplace 
looking forward to  management believes it can achieve its targeted gpm 
expected favorable influences include growth in sales volume without a similar increase in overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products to reduce costs 
unfavorable influences are expected to be continued competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus remaining after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative expenses sg a and research and development expenses r d 
utmd further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing expenses s m and general and administrative expenses g a 
despite the decrease in sales  operating profits increased to  from  in  and  in total operating expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in  and in  demonstrating the company s ability to effectively manage its expenses 
sg a expenses in decreased to of revenues from of revenues in  and in in dollar terms sg a expenses decreased to million in from million in  and million in the g a expenses portion  which includes the company s costs of litigation and amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions gwa  decreased to million in from million in  and million in gwa in both and was  compared to in looking forward  gwa in will be with no new acquisitions 
since the result of the acquisitions were additional new marketable products for utmd  the gwa expenses can be regarded as surrogate r d expenses captured in g a 
s m expenses are the costs of communicating our differences and product advantages  as well as providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s products 
although revenues and gpms increase when the same unit sales are made by directly employed sales representatives in lieu of independent distributors or oem customers  s m operating expenses increase as an offset 
contract administration fees paid to gpos are also included in s m expenses 
year s m expenses decreased to million in from million in  and million in  as utmd rationalized the lack of effectiveness of its direct sales people 
although utmd expects higher gpo fees  increased advertising expenses and new marketing initiatives in that were not incurred in  utmd plans to manage its s m expenses as a ratio of sales to remain consistent with the previous year 
r d expenses in were of sales compared to of sales in  and in in dollar terms r d expenses decreased to million in from million in  and million in year projects included completion of development of the gesco picc  continued improvements and augmentations to the gesco neonatal product line  development of a proprietary oem product  continued collaborative work with manufacturing on improvements to utmd s established products  technical review and analysis of various acquisition opportunities and focused development of several new product concepts approved for internal r d projects 
the resulting improvements in materials and configuration of components was evident in utmd s substantially improved gpms 
in  utmd will opportunistically invest r d resources and make r d expenditures where management anticipates it can get a significant return on its investments with future new product sales 
those expenses are most likely to be in the range of of sales 
d non operating income 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing unutilized property to others  interest earned and capital gains from investing the company s cash  and gains or losses from the sale of assets offset by non operating expenses like interest expenses and bank fees on the revolving line of credit 
non operating income in was  compared to in and in there were unusual payments received in for the use of utmd s pressure monitoring technology  which are subject to a confidentiality agreement  which were nonrecurring in and royalties received were in  in and in royalties received vary from period to period depending on the desire and or success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the patents 
interest expenses and bank fees associated with the line of credit  which reduced non operating income  were in  in and in assuming current interest rates are about average for the whole year of and no new borrowing  management expects net non operating income to be about the same as earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt dollars in were lower than in mainly because non operating income was million lower as a result of the interest cost of financing a major repurchase of shares 
in dollar terms  ebt decreased to million in from million in when sales were higher  up from million in when sales were about the same as in as a percentage of sales  ebt were compared to and in and  respectively 
the exceptional ebt performance was a company record  excluding when ebt at benefitted from  higher unusual non operating income which represented of sales 
the resulting profit dollars are equivalent to profits generated by well performing companies with twice or more the sales of utmd 
utmd management continues to target ebt near of sales in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
after income taxes  net income was  compared to  in and  in the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  amount of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profitability of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  changes in the amount of non deductible goodwill expense resulting from an acquisition  and other factors such as r d tax credits and actual litigation costs versus accrued expenses 
the amortization of goodwill associated with the columbia medical  inc acquisition is not tax deductible 
similar to ebt  utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for years  and  respectively 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the applicable period average market value 
diluted eps were up to 
compared to 
in  and were up compared to 
in when sales were about the same 
the combination of higher profits and substantially fewer shares created a significant improvement in shareholder value in the form of higher eps 
utmd management believes shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  future eps will continue to benefit from recent share repurchases 
the favorable trade off in increased eps as a result of decreased non operating income as a result of financing costs should be evident 
eps can be further increased by investing current net income to increase future net profits through expanding the number of differentiated products and profitable business operations  or by repurchasing stock  thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares 
return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues 
in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
roe in was  and has averaged for the last fourteen years 
cash flows and capital resources 
a cash flows 
ebitda ebt  plus non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  asset dispositions and interest expense and bank fees associated with the line of credit is the term used for measuring a company s ability to generate cash 
utmd s ebitda in was million  or as a ratio of sales  a company record 
ebitda has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of excellent operating earnings  a substantial non cash charge to earnings from amortization of goodwill and royalty income from others use of utmd s technology 
because of ebitda performance in  utmd was able to purchase in intangible assets  in net new property and equipment to maintain its facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order and repurchase  worth of its shares  about a net reduction  while only increasing its bank revolving line of credit balance by million 
to complete the cash flow picture  the company received from exercises of employee options 
cash and equivalent balances were at the end of utmd effectively maintains zero balance sweep cash account balances that minimize the line of credit balance  except for amounts held to meet operating requirements in ireland and separate physical reserves set aside for litigation expenses and other contractual commitments where cash has been committed 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in a smaller decrease adjusted for exchange rate changes in inventories during was the largest contributor to the change compared to prior years 
financing activities in provided additional cash of  through the bank line of credit 
a total of  shares of stock were repurchased at an average cost  including commissions  of share  using  in cash 
utmd received in cash from the sale of  shares of stock through employee option exercises at an average price of per share 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans and repay debt 
planned capital expenditures  expected to be in the range of  will keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to the capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and  if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
utmd plans to use any cash not needed for the above pursuits during the remainder of to reduce the line of credit balance 
the revolving credit line will continue to be used for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time 
management s outlook 
in  utmd intends to improve its direct us sales team as a resource for achieving utmd s objectives to help clarify clinician needs  responsively provide excellent solutions for those needs  and assure timely support for clinical customers use of utmd s solutions 
to be successful in its marketing efforts  utmd must engage physicians with the information they need to make important judgments about using certain products in obtaining optimal clinical outcomes  which include minimizing risk of complications and unnecessary procedures 
it is difficult for utmd to find medical device salespeople who understand that hospital administrators are not the best target for the company s sales approach 
utmd needs to do a better job differentiating itself from its competitors 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits as well as minimal total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product  period 
utmd needs to simplify its communications with clinical customers  and in we will vigorously accept this challenge 
in the us  utmd will also continue to leverage its reputation with physicians  who use its products in specialty hospital areas  outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed new business partners 
in  utmd expects its ireland subsidiary  which shipped of foreign sales in  to continue its important contribution to overall performance 
internally generated cash flow impacts shareholder value to the extent it can be used to drive marketing and new product development programs that grow the business  fund attractive acquisitions  or be returned to investors through dividends or share repurchases 
many financial analysts agree that a company s value is not based on historical sales or earnings  but rather the certainty of its future cash flow 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high cash flow by achieving record ebitda performance of of sales 
in and  ebitda was and of sales  respectively 
over the last four calendar years  utmd s cash flow funded several significant events a net million after all option exercises repurchase of million of its shares yielding an average cost of per share including commissions and other repurchase costs  two acquisitions costing million which accounted for of total sales in  and r d spending of million 
historically  utmd has been able to achieve outstanding cash flow 
in  management plans to extend utmd s excellent ebitda performance for another year 
in a competitive marketplace  utmd has built and intends to successfully defend a dominant market franchise in the most special areas of hospitals caring for mothers and their babies  with differentiated and highly effective products under well recognized brands 
given the awareness of utmd s brands  the internet will increasingly become an effective distribution tool to circumvent anticompetitive bureaucratic market forces 
utmd s sales and marketing resources will employ the internet  along with other varied initiatives to maintain and further build utmd s differentiation from its competitors 
our vision is contrary to that of industry analysts who believe the walmartization of the medical device industry is inevitable 
we will not devote resources to pursue undifferentiated products and services  nor will we devalue our differentiated solutions to providing better healthcare 
utmd s ending share price of was up relative to the end of the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were down  and  respectively 
eps in were up  and have grown annually at a compounded rate of since with eps of  utmd s year end price to earnings ratio per was  still well below the average market multiple 
for example  if the average market multiple declines to in a recessionary environment in  utmd s per multiple could still expand to and remain well below the market average 
accounting policy changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
sfas is now effective for fiscal years beginning after june  utmd believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company
