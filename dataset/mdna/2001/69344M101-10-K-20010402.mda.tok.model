pmi s claim process begins with receipt of notification of a default from the insured on an insured loan 
default is defined in pmi s master policy as the borrower s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage 
generally  the master policy requires an insured to notify pmi of a default no later than the last business day of the month following the month in which the borrower becomes three monthly payments in default 
in most cases  defaults are reported earlier 
pmi s insureds typically report defaults within approximately days of the initial default 
borrowers default for a variety of reasons  including the reduction of income  unemployment  divorce  illness  the inability to manage credit  and the level of interest rates 
borrowers may cure defaults by making all of the delinquent loan payments or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage 
defaults that are not cured result in a claim to pmi

with respect to traditional primary loans insured by pmi  insurance written from the period of january  through december  represented of pmi s insurance in force at december  this portion of pmi s book of business is in its expected peak default and claim period 
claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a primary book of business 
based on the company s experience  the majority of claims occur in the third through sixth years after loan origination  and relatively few claims are paid during the first two years after loan origination 
pmi believes that loans in its developing non traditional primary book will have shorter lives and earlier incidences of default than loans in pmi s traditional book 
non traditional loans represented of pmi s insurance in force at december   primarily from the policy year 
pmi believes that the default rate on its non traditional book  excluding alternative a loans  will likely increase during and this could cause pmi s primary default rate to increase during see underwriting practices contract underwriting  above 
claims and policy servicing direct primary claims paid by pmi in decreased to million from million in see part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the frequency of defaults does not directly correlate to the number of claims pmi receives 
this is because the rate at which defaults cure is influenced by borrowers financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences 
whether an uncured default leads to a claim principally depends on the borrower s equity at the time of default and the borrower s or the insured s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan 
when the chance of a defaulted loan reinstating is minimal  pmi works with the servicer of the loan for possible loan workout or early disposal of the underlying property 
property dispositions typically result in savings to pmi over the percentage coverage amount payable under the master policy 
under the terms of pmi s master policy  the insured shall file a claim with pmi no later than days after it has acquired title to the underlying property  usually through foreclosure 
an insurance claim amount includes 
the amount of unpaid principal due under the loan  
the amount of accumulated delinquent interest due on the loan  excluding late charges  to the lesser of the date of claim filing or sixty days following the acquisition of title to the underlying property  
certain expenses advanced by the insured such as hazard insurance premiums  property maintenance expenses and property taxes to the date of claim filing  and 
certain foreclosure costs  including attorneys fees 
the claim amount is subject to review and possible adjustment by pmi 
depending on the applicable state foreclosure law  an average of about months elapses from the date of default to filing of a claim on an uncured default 
pmi s master policy excludes coverage for physical damage whether caused by fire  earthquake or other hazard where the borrower s default was caused by an uninsured casualty 
pmi has the right to rescind coverage and not pay a claim if the insured  its agents or the borrower misrepresent material information in the insurance application 
according to industry practice  a misrepresentation is generally considered material if the insurer would not have agreed to insure the loan had the true facts been known at the time of certificate issuance 
within days after a claim and any necessary supporting documentation have been filed  pmi has the option of 
paying the coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance  
in the event the property is sold pursuant to an arrangement made prior to or during the day period after the claim is filed a prearranged sale  paying the lesser of i of the claim amount less the proceeds of sale of the property or ii the coverage percentage multiplied by the claim amount  or 
paying of the claim amount in exchange for the insured s conveyance to pmi of good and marketable title to the property  with pmi then selling the property for its own account 
properties acquired under this option are included on pmi s balance sheet in other assets as residential properties from claim settlements also known as reo 
pmi attempts to choose the claim settlement option which best mitigates the amount of its claim payment 
however  pmi generally settles by paying the coverage percentage multiplied by the claim amount 
in and  pmi settled and  respectively  of the primary claims processed for payment on the basis of a prearranged sale 
in and  pmi exercised the option to acquire the property on approximately and  respectively  of the primary claims processed for payment 
at december  and  pmi owned million and million  respectively  of reo valued at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
this increase resulted primarily from increases in the number and value of reo 
the ratio of the claim paid to the original risk in force relating to such loan is referred to as claim severity and is a factor that influences pmi s losses 
the main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan  accrued interest on the loan  expenses advanced by the insured and the foreclosure expenses 
these amounts depend in part on the time required to complete foreclosure which varies depending on state laws 
pre foreclosure sales and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall severity 
the average claim severity level has decreased from in to in technology for claims and policy servicing technology is an integral part of the claims and policy servicing process and pmi believes that technology will continue to take on a greater role in increasing internal efficiencies and improving customer service 
with increasing frequency  pmi s customers expect pmi to offer them technological solutions with respect to claims submission  claim payment and policy servicing 
see ic s 
defaults and claims 
pmi  through its automatic default reporting process adr  allows paperless reporting of default information by the insured 
pmi uses an automated claim for loss worksheet program which compiles pertinent data while automatically calculating the claim amount and predicting the best settlement alternative 
to enhance efficiencies and ease of use for its customers  pmi developed document free claimease sm which is designed to require only an addendum to the uniform claim for loss worksheet  thereby reducing paperwork and resulting in more rapid claims settlements 
pmi offers customers the option of receiving claims payments by direct deposit to their bank accounts rather than by check 
to contain costs and expand internal efficiencies  pmi uses optical imaging in its claims functions allowing pmi to eliminate the transfer and storage of documents relating to claims 
policy servicing 
pmi has developed several technology tools with respect to policy servicing and claims 
pmiphone connect sm is a voice response application that enables the insured to access pmi s database via telephone to inquire on the status of coverage and to obtain information on billings  refunds and renewals 
pmiweb connect sm is an enhanced version of pmiphone connect and provides access to pmi s servicing database via the internet  thus allowing customers to inform pmi of loan closing dates  servicing transfers  defaults and claims 
pmi is also capable of receiving claims  handling premium billing  and executing loan sale transfers via edi 
loan performance in  the company adopted substantially more conservative underwriting standards that  along with increased premium rates and generally improving economic conditions in various regions  are believed by the company to have contributed to the lower cumulative loss payment ratios in subsequent years 
while the cumulative loss payment ratios of policy years through will increase over time  the cumulative loss payment ratio for each such year at december  is lower than the cumulative loss payment ratio for each of the years through at the same number of years after original policy issuance 
the table below sets forth cumulative losses paid by pmi at the end of each successive year after the year of original policy issuance policy year  expressed as a percentage of the cumulative premiums written on such policies 
years percentage of cumulative losses paid since to cumulative premiums written policy issue policy issue year in percents in percents this table shows that  measured by cumulative losses paid relative to cumulative premiums written cumulative loss payment ratios  the performance of policies originally issued in the years through was adverse  with cumulative loss payment ratios for those years ranging from to at the end of such adverse experience was significantly impacted by deteriorating economic and real estate market conditions in the oil patch states 
the table also demonstrates the general improvement in pmi s cumulative loss payment ratios since policy year this reflects both improved claims experience for the more recent years and the higher premium rates charged by pmi beginning in policy years through generally have had the best cumulative loss payment ratios of any years since policy years through displayed somewhat higher loss payment ratios than through at the same age of development 
this was due primarily to the increased refinancings of mortgages originating in policy years to which resulted in reduced aggregate premiums and led to higher default rates on california loans 
for policy years through  cumulative losses have been developing at a favorable rate for the company due to improving economic conditions 
in  pmi expanded its product offerings to include insurance for non traditional loans which are primarily alternative a and less than a quality loans 
non traditional loans generally have shorter lives and earlier incidences of default than traditional a quality loans 
these earlier incidences of default have resulted in a small but larger than normal number of claims already paid in calendar year on loans insured during the year 
claim payments  when divided by the relatively small amount of written premium on loans insured during the year  have resulted in a cumulative claim payment ratio of at december  this ratio  which represents thirty one policies issued in upon which claims were also paid in  is higher than for any year shown in the table at the same age of development 
however  pmi attempts to incorporate its expectation of non traditional loans higher default rates into its pricing for such business 
because of these pricing adjustments and because the non traditional business represents a relatively small portion of pmi s total book  management expects that future development of the year ratio will be similar to that of the years through given pmi s limited experience with respect to these loans there can be no assurance that premiums charged will be sufficient to cover losses 
see ic s 
loss reserves a significant period of time may elapse between the occurrence of the borrower s default on mortgage payments the event triggering a potential future claims payment  the reporting of such default to pmi and the eventual payment of the claim related to such uncured default 
to recognize the liability for unpaid losses related to the default inventory pmi  in accordance with industry practice  establishes loss reserves in respect of defaults included in such inventory  based upon the estimated claim rate and estimated average claim amount 
included in loss reserves are loss adjustment expense lae reserves  and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
these reserves are estimates and there can be no assurance that pmi s reserves will prove to be adequate to cover ultimate loss developments on reported defaults 
see ic s 
consistent with industry accounting practices  pmi does not establish loss reserves in respect of estimated potential defaults that may occur in the future 
pmi s reserving process for primary insurance is based on default notifications received by pmi in a given year the report year method 
in the report year method  ultimate claim rates and average claim amounts selected for each report year are estimated based on past experience 
claim rates and amounts are also estimated by region for the most recent report years to validate nationwide report year estimates which are then used in the normal reserving methodology 
for each report year the claim rate  estimated average claim amount and the number of reported defaults are multiplied together to determine the amount of direct incurred losses for that report year 
losses paid to date for that report year are subtracted from the estimated report year incurred losses to obtain the loss reserve for that report year 
the sum of the reserves for all report years yields the total loss reserve on reported defaults 
pool business loss reserving is subject to the same assumptions and economic uncertainties as primary insurance and generally involves the following process 
pmi divides all currently pending pool insurance delinquencies into six categories of delinquency  which connote progressively more serious stages of default eg  delinquent less than four months  delinquent more than four months  in foreclosure but no sale date set 
a claim rate is selected for each category based on past experience and management judgment 
expected claim sizes  stated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance on the delinquent loan  are similarly selected 
the loss reserve is then generally calculated as the sum over all delinquent loans of the product of the outstanding loan balance  the claim rate and the expected claim size percentage 
pmi reviews its claim rate and claim amount assumptions on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts its loss reserves accordingly 
the impact of inflation is not explicitly isolated from other factors influencing the reserve estimates although inflation is implicitly included in the estimates 
pmi does not discount its loss reserves for financial reporting purposes 
pmi s reserving process is based upon the assumption that past experience  adjusted for the anticipated effect of current economic conditions and projected future economic trends  provides a reasonable basis for estimating future events 
however  estimation of loss reserves is a highly subjective process especially in light of changing economic conditions 
in addition  economic conditions that have affected the development of the loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future 
pmi s actuarial services department performs the loss reserve analysis 
on the basis of such loss reserve analysis  management believes that the loss reserves are  in the aggregate  computed in accordance with commonly accepted loss reserving standards and principles and meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations to which it is subject 
management also believes that the loss reserves are a reasonable provision for all unpaid loss and lae obligations under the terms of its policies and agreements 
see ic s 
such reserves are necessarily based on estimates and the ultimate net cost may vary from such estimates 
these estimates of ultimate losses are based on management s analysis of various economic trends including the real estate market and unemployment rates and their effect on recent claim rate and claim severity experience 
these estimates are regularly reviewed and updated using the most current information available 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in current financial statements 
for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses  see part ii
