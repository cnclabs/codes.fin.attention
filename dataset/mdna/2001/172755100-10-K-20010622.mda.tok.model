certain reclassifications have been made to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on the results of operations or stockholders equity 
cirrus logic is a leading supplier of high performance analog and dsp chip solutions for internet entertainment electronics  analog and magnetic markets 
the company designs and manufactures integrated circuits  or chips  that use high performance analog and digital signal processing technologies 
our mixed signal devices are designed for specific markets that derive value from our expertise in advanced mixed signal design processing  systems level engineering and software knowledge 
our products  sold under our own name and the crystal r  maverick r  and ci tm product brands  enable our customers to quickly deliver leading edge technology products that are in high demand from consumers 
during fiscal  we achieved over sales growth in our core businesses  and stockholders equity increased approximately million due to the conversion of debt and accrued interest 
total long term debt was million at fiscal year end  compared to million at the end of fiscal we had net income of million in fiscal  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal we completed the year with million of cash and  within one year  stockholders equity went from a deficit of million to a surplus of million 
net sales net sales for fiscal increased to million  an increase of from million in fiscal net sales from core businesses  consisting of the magnetic storage  analog  internet  and corporate and other business segments in fiscal  increased over to million  from million in fiscal sales of core products increased in primarily due to a substantial increase in net sales in the magnetic storage business group 
magnetic storage revenues increased to million in  an increase of from million in fiscal net sales in the analog and internet business segments increased and  respectively  in fiscal  to million and million  from million and million in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in internet revenue in was primarily due to the strong production ramp of maverick r processors for mp players and strong cd rw sales 
revenues from businesses that have been discontinued by us are included in our end of life business segment 
revenues from discontinued businesses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal we expect that our revenues related to our magnetic storage business  principally from fujitsu  western digital and hitachi  will decline significantly beginning in fiscal  decreasing primarily over our second and third fiscal quarters of under an agreement with fujitsu that we entered into effective july   fujitsu purchased from us magnetic storage chips  resulting in million in net sales to us in fiscal  or of our net sales for that period 
fujitsu committed under the agreement to purchase from us approximately million in magnetic storage chip products over the month term of the agreement 
currently we are in negotiations with fujitsu regarding our continued supply of products beyond the term of the agreement 
while we expect to receive additional orders beyond june   we anticipate a significant reduction in the orders received 
we have binding purchase orders with western digital to supply our magnetic storage chips through september our sales of magnetic storage chips to western digital resulted in million in net sales in fiscal  or of our net sales 
we are discussing future sales of magnetic storage chips  as well as other products 
it is premature to predict whether these discussions will result in continuing orders and  if additional orders are received  the magnitude of any such orders  although we expect any orders placed to be a significant reduction from orders placed during fiscal with respect to hitachi  we have binding purchase orders to supply our magnetic storage chips through july we believe that hitachi will no longer be buying these products from us after we fulfill our obligations under these purchase orders 
effective with the first quarter of fiscal  we have recognized revenue on international shipments based on customer receipt and title passage of inventory  instead of on the date of shipment  which was our historical method 
results for fiscal include revenue of million  cost of sales of million  and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million as a result of this change 
also  during the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our estimate of the amount of revenue that is deferred on distributor transactions under agreements with only limited rights of return 
results for fiscal include revenue of million  cost of sales of million  and income of million related to this change in estimate 
the effect of this estimate change increased basic and diluted earnings per share by for fiscal royalty revenue of million is also included in net sales for fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of from million in fiscal net sales from the core businesses in fiscal were approximately million  compared to million in fiscal sales of core products decreased during fiscal primarily due to reduced volumes in the magnetic storage business  partially offset by increased volumes in the analog and internet business groups 
average selling prices also declined in fiscal revenues in fiscal and included amounts from businesses that have been discontinued by us and are included in our end of life business group 
revenues from discontinued businesses in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal net sales in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal  excluding revenues from discontinued businesses and million of revenues from patent cross license agreements in fiscal the decrease was largely due to decreased sales in magnetic storage products  primarily related to decreased unit volumes and average selling prices of read channel devices and controllers  which were offset by increased sales in audio products  primarily related to increased unit volume 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal export sales to customers located in the pacific rim excluding japan were   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
export sales to customers located in japan were   and of net sales 
all other export sales were   and of net sales  in fiscal   and  respectively 
our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposures related to sales and balance sheet accounts denominated in yen 
in fiscal  sales to fujitsu accounted for of net sales  and sales to western digital accounted for of net sales 
as set forth above  we anticipate a significant reduction in the sales made to both fujitsu and western digital in the next two quarters 
one customer accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively of net sales in fiscal no other customers accounted for or more of net sales in fiscal   or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in such a customer s orders could have an adverse effect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was in fiscal gross margin decreased during fiscal  primarily due to lower margins on sales of magnetic storage products 
also  we recognized an inventory charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mainly to reserve inventory that is excess to short term usage forecasts 
gross margin was in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was impacted by declining average selling prices in the audio  magnetic and optical storage businesses 
this was partially offset by lower production costs in the audio and magnetic storage units 
additionally  our sales mix in fiscal shifted toward lower margin analog business group products 
gross margin for fiscal was negative 
included in gross margin for fiscal was million related to the write off of both micrus and cirent joint venture assets  which were deemed to be impaired in fiscal based upon an assessment that future cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  million of charges related to excess wafer purchase commitments with micrus and cirent joint ventures  and million were inventory write downs associated with businesses being phased out 
research and development expenses research and development expenditures increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in total employees and the change in employee mix from fiscal at the end of fiscal  approximately of employees were engaged in research and development  compared to at the end of fiscal although these expenses increased in total dollars in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales they have decreased from to over the last three fiscal years 
research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
research and development expenditures decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to lower headcount related to the fiscal restructuring efforts to focus research and development on our precision linear and mixed signal positions in the analog  internet  and magnetic storage markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal  mainly due to an increase in headcount of over last year and compensation expense recognized in connection with the acquisition of audiologic  inc although these expenses increased in total dollars in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales they have decreased from to over the last three fiscal years 
selling  general  and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales represented approximately   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense attributable to our efforts to collect accounts receivable  a decrease in the allowance for bad debts  and restructuring activities during fiscal  which included the divestiture of several non core businesses and headcount reductions made in order for the support structure to be in line with our current business model

as of march  we have a remaining restructuring accrual of million  which we expect to discharge in fiscal through cash payments 
on may   we announced a change to our business model  in which we are de emphasizing our magnetic storage chip business and are focusing on consumer entertainment electronics 
on may   we announced cost reduction actions to align company resources and expenses with this new business model 
in connection with these strategic decisions  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees worldwide  or about nine percent of the total workforce 
we estimate annualized savings of approximately million from the combination of these layoffs and reductions in third party contractor expenses 
we expect to record a special charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal to cover costs associated with these workforce reductions 
during fiscal  we substantially completed the restructuring activities that were initiated in fiscal we restructured our relationships with our manufacturing joint ventures and returned to a fabless business model 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million of which is in cost of sales 
these restructuring charges included a million direct cash payment to one of the joint venture partners  million related to certain cirrus logic common stock that we issued to one of the joint venture partners  million of lease buyout costs  and million of equipment write offs 
these charges were partially offset by the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued wafer purchase commitment charges due to the renegotiated terms of our purchase commitments with our former partners

the charges included cost of sales of million related to asset impairment  million related to wafer purchase commitment charges  and million related to inventory write downs 
in addition  we recorded charges of million related to severance and related benefits  along with facilities scale back and other costs 
acquired in process research development expenses during fiscal  we recorded million  or of net sales of acquired in process research and development expenses  resulting from our acquisition of audiologic  inc we expensed these amounts on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
future acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us might also result in charges for acquired in process research and development that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
abandonment of assets charge during fiscal  we discontinued development efforts previously undertaken on the manufacturing component of our enterprise resource planning software 
in connection with this decision  we recorded an asset abandonment charge of approximately million 
interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the repurchase and conversion of million of our convertible subordinated notes 
interest income interest income in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal is primarily due to the interest earned on the increased cash and cash equivalent balances at march   compared to march  interest income in fiscal declined from fiscal due to cash payments required in connection with the restructuring activities in the first quarter 
this was partially offset by cash inflows later in the year from the liquidation of certain investments 
realized gains on the sale of marketable equity securities and investments we realized net gains of million related to the sale of investments in fiscal  primarily from the sale of our interest in basis communications to intel corporation  resulting in a gain of million 
we realized gains of million in fiscal due to sales of stock and associated options we sold in openwave systems  inc common stock formerly known as phone

other income for fiscal includes gains on the disposal of certain equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal on income before provision of income taxes of million 
our effective income tax rate of approximately was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily because of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
in fiscal years   and  we provided a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
even though we were able to utilize some of these deferred tax assets in  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  we continue to provide a valuation allowance equal to our remaining net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties that remain regarding their realization 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we recognized no income tax benefit for fiscal losses 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted primarily from million of deferred income tax expense recorded as a valuation allowance to offset net deferred tax assets which had been recognized as of march  quarterly financial information amounts in thousands  except per share data the following table sets forth certain quarterly statement of operations data for each full fiscal quarter within the two most recent fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt investment securities  equity price risk on investment securities  and currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses at march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk at march   our marketable securities consisted of short term  fixed rate securities 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on either the fair value of our investments or our results of operations 
equity price risk we are exposed to price risk on publicly traded equity investment securities 
a change in the value of the related securities would not have a material effect on our operations 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue and spending is transacted in us dollars  however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen through our japanese subsidiary 
we repatriate these amounts on a quarterly or monthly basis  depending on underlying accounts receivable collections 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through financial market instruments  principally through foreign exchange forward contracts 
the foreign exchange contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis based upon fluctuations of the underlying currency in relation to the us dollar  and the gains or losses are reflected in operations 
during fiscal and  we entered into various foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain yen denominated net balance sheet accounts and sales 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding to purchase million at an average exchange rate of japanese yen per dollar 
as of march   we did not have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
at march   an immediate change in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of the exchange contracts  changes in exchange rates can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency sales prices
