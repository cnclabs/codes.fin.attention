item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro biotherapeutics  inc you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  referred to as the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  production and licensing of complex natural product pharmaceuticals as well as the development and licensing of novel genetic technologies for applications in human therapeutics and diagnostics  pharmacogenomics and agribiotechnology 
natural product substances have been  and continue to be  the primary source of new prototype chemotherapeutic anti cancer agents 
our lead product is paclitaxel  a naturally occurring chemotherapeutic anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew  or taxus trees 
in addition to our efforts with paclitaxel and genetics  we are also working on several types of compounds which have promising activity as anti cancer agents 
we believe some of these agents function by new and novel mechanisms  which may increase their likelihood of success as new chemotherapeutics 
we are also actively engaged in evaluating the in licensing or purchase of potential new products and or technologies  whether or not those products or technologies are derived from natural products 
our evaluations of new products and technologies may involve examination of individual molecules  classes of compounds or platform technologies  in the cancer field and otherwise 
acquisitions of new products or technology may involve the purchase of  or merger with  other companies 
we continue to incur substantial expense for research and development related to preclinical and clinical studies  improving manufacturing processes and other development activity 
accordingly  we have incurred significant operating losses  including operating losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect that we will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with our paclitaxel biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
we anticipate that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as we are able to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations 
in march  we and ivax corporation terminated marketing between the two companies 
primarily  our ability to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations depends upon the successful completion of our paclitaxel development program 
our strategy for that program has been to form strategic alliances through long term exclusive agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
on july   we entered into an exclusive collaborative agreement of up to years covering the us and canada with abbott laboratories to develop and commercialize one or more formulations of paclitaxel for the treatment of a variety of cancers 
under our agreement with abbott  we are responsible for supply of bulk drug and clinical trials are conducted jointly 
abbott is responsible for finishing  regulatory filings  marketing  and sale of the finished drug product 
most primary decisions related to the paclitaxel development program are made by a joint abbott napro development committee 
in march we and abbott filed an anda with the fda for paclitaxel 
in connection with the abbott agreement  we may receive total funding of up to million in the form of development and marketing milestone payments  a secured loan and equity investments 
in july we received an initial million fee 
through december   abbott has purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of million 
contingent upon our successful achievement of all development milestones  including the payments received through  we could receive up to million consisting of million in development fees and up to million for the purchase of million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we have access to a total of million under a secured loan arrangement with abbott  including draws through of million 
the loan bears a primary interest rate of and is due in full on the earlier of i the second anniversary of the first sale of finished product by abbott to a wholesaler or end user customer following approval of finished product by the fda  ii the termination of the abbott agreement  or iii january  the loan is limited to a borrowing base of collateral ized assets  recomputed monthly 
substantially all of our hard assets are collateralized as security for the loan 
contingent upon receiving regulatory approval and achieving certain commercial sales thresholds over several years  we may receive additional milestone payments from abbott in the range of zero up to million 
we cannot assure that regulatory approval or sales thresholds will be achieved 
under terms of the agreement  abbott will purchase bulk drug from us 
if the paclitaxel product is approved and commercialized  abbott will pay a percentage of its net paclitaxel sales to us  less abbott s payments for purchase of bulk drug 
abbott may terminate the agreement at any time with or without cause 
should abbott terminate without cause  it is obligated to make payments to us 
in we entered into a year exclusive agreement with fh faulding co  ltd  australia s largest domestic pharmaceutical company  for the clinical development  sale  marketing and distribution of our paclitaxel 
faulding  with sales of approximately billion  actively markets anti cancer pharmaceuticals and other health care products in australia  southeast asia and other countries throughout the world 
in  we amended the faulding agreement to  among other things  add additional countries to faulding s exclusive territory 
in we entered into a separate agreement with faulding covering development and sale of our paclitaxel in europe 
including the new agreement for europe  the faulding territory includes substantially all of the world other than the us  canada  japan  israel and the former soviet union 
faulding has received marketing approval for  and is selling our paclitaxel as anzatax in  more than countries 
in europe  we are responsible for regulatory filings and will supply paclitaxel raw material exclusively to faulding to formulate and finish the product 
we cannot assure that we will receive regulatory approval in europe 
should we receive approval  faulding will then market and sell the final proprietary paclitaxel formulation in europe 
under the agreement  faulding paid an up front licensing fee to us of million 
we will share equally the net sales of the product in europe 
in anticipation of final fda approval for commercial sales  we have completed construction of our redesigned manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado 
we cannot assure  however  that our paclitaxel will receive regulatory approval or be successfully marketed 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up  from sales to faulding for were million  up million from the increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of countries in which faulding is licensed to sell paclitaxel 
sales to ivax  as a result of the termination agreement  ended in the third quarter 
we plan no future paclitaxel sales to ivax 
pending regulatory approval  we anticipate sales to abbott will commence in research and development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of product sold for was million  up by million from the increase resulted primarily from a one time charge of  for the startup cost of our boulder  colorado paclitaxel extraction facility and an increased cost of clinical trials  partially offset by decreased cost associated with develop ment of the semisynthetic manufacturing process 
our production process is not distinct from our research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included in our research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  up million from the increase is attributable primarily to increased compensation  increased regulatory expense and increased recruiting expense 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets for was million  up million from the increase was attributable to prior construction cost that had no applicability in the redesign of the manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado 
license fee income 
license fees for were million 
there was no similar amount in the amount included million in milestone payments under the abbott agreement 
the remainder of the license fees were paid under the terms of the ivax termination agreement 
we expect no further payments under the ivax agreement 
although license fees and milestone payments are unusual and may be non recurring  million was received under the faulding european agreement in the first quarter of interest income 
interest income for was  up  from the increase is primarily attributable to higher overall balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest and other expense for was  the same as decreased interest on the senior convertible debt because of the final conversion was offset by interest on the abbott loan 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up million from sales to faulding for were million  up million from the increase was partially due to an increase in the number of countries in which faulding is licensed to sell paclitaxel 
the increase was also partially due to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of our strategic partners 
sales to ivax  as a result of the termination agreement  ended in the third quarter 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  up by million from the increase resulted primarily from an increase in clinical trial activity and increased cost associated with development of the semisynthetic manufacturing process 
our production process is not distinct from our research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included in our research and develop ment expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  down  from the decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease of  in legal expense related to european patent litigation  partially offset by increased compensation and increases in retirement plan contributions 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets for was  down million from the decrease was attributable to the losses in resulting from the suspended construction on the boulder  colorado manufacturing facilities and from the closure of the contract extraction facility on prince edward island  canada 
license fee income 
license fees for were million  down million from the amount included million in milestone payments under the abbott agreement 
the remainder of the license fees and all of the license fees were paid under the terms of the ivax termination agreement 
license fees and milestone payments are unusual and may be non recurring 
we expect no further payments under the ivax agreement 
interest income 
interest income for was  down  from the decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest and other expense for was  down  from the decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased interest on senior convertible debt that was converted into shares of our common stock  partially offset by interest on the abbott loan 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have been  and will continue to be  significant 
as of december   we had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million as of december  we have a million secured borrowing arrangement with abbott  of which million had been drawn as of december  to date  we have funded our capital require ments primarily with the net proceeds of public offerings of our common stock of approximately million  with private placements of our equity securities of approximately million  with the exercise of warrants and options of million  with net borrowings of million  and with loans and advances from our stockholders and strategic partners 
our existing capital  projected sales  anticipated license fees and milestone payments  and available borrowing under the abbott loan are expected to provide adequate capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures in however  pharmaceutical development is a costly and time consuming process 
we are actively pursuing additional partners to assist in the development and marketing of our products  and may seek other forms of long term financing should such financing become available on acceptable terms 
we may in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost of acquiring and developing such resources  and related capital expenditures  may be very large 
as a result  we may need to attract substantial amounts of capital 
we cannot assure that we will be able to do so 
in november  we completed a private placement to accredited investors of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  we received net proceeds of million 
we registered the resale of the stock with the sec 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents increased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash used by operations of million and by investing activity of million was offset by financing activity of million 
inventory was million at december  the amount of work in progress inventory and finished goods inventory is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of our strategic partners and its production planning for meeting those needs 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
we anticipate that the level of our accounts receivable may increase significantly as we anticipate the regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel in the us capital expenditures we spent million during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included the extraction facility  plantation cost and laboratory equipment 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the cost of manufacturing scale up for paclitaxel  the development of new products  the cost of manufacturing resources for new products  the nature of our relationship with our strategic partners  the establishment of additional strategic relationships  the progress of our research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellec tual property rights  competing technological and marketing developments  and changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships 
for we are anticipating significant expenditures for improving efficiency and expanding capacity at our existing facilities 
we are also expecting to complete the design for  and begin construction of  a new large scale facility during the expanded scope of our research and development activity will require significant additions to laboratory equipment 
all of these factors  and others  lead us to expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in although we may seek additional long term financing to fund the increases in capital expenditures  there can be no assurances that we can obtain such financing on terms which are economically viable for us 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards if there has been a change of ownership as described in section of the internal revenue code 
such a change of ownership may limit our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  and could be triggered by sales of securities by us or our stockholders

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  virtually all of our revenue resulted from sales of our paclitaxel to faulding 
we anticipate sales to abbott in  however  sales to faulding will remain significant 
faulding purchases our paclitaxel from us at a price that varies in proportion to the price at which faulding sells our paclitaxel 
under our agreement with faulding  we are paid a fixed percentage of faulding s sales price for paclitaxel supplied for commercial use 
in march of each year  faulding estimates the sales price it will receive for paclitaxel sales in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  we determine the price we will charge faulding for paclitaxel 
we recognize the corresponding revenue at the time of shipment of our paclitaxel to faulding  based upon the intended use indicated by faulding on its purchase orders 
however  faulding may or may not use the product in accordance with the original use stated on its purchase orders 
additionally  faulding s actual selling price may differ from the amounts originally budgeted and indicated to napro on its purchase orders 
on or about may   faulding will communicate to us the final amount and type of sales made during the period beginning on april  and ending on march   and an adjustment will be calculated that may increase or decrease our revenue from sales of products to faulding during this period 
faulding s sales are made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sells our paclitaxel 
as a result  our revenue from sales is affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
one of faulding s largest single markets is australia  accounting for approximately of faulding s commercial sales during the period beginning march  and ending march  in the past  fluctuations in various currencies  especially the australian dollar  were a significant factor in reductions in the price we charge faulding 
if changes in foreign currency markets continue to cause a decrease in the price per gram we receive from faulding  there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow 
to the extent our efforts in developing additional international markets are successful  we may face similar foreign currency exchange risk as that described above for faulding
