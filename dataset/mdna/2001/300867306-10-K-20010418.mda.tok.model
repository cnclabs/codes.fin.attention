the company s activities during its early stages of operation focused on the development of software solutions to provide customer communications support to businesses 
in  the company began providing professional services in the areas of marketing program design and execution and data warehousing

ca develops and markets campaign management solutions focused on creating  executing  analyzing and measuring customer communications at the local or branch level 
the company generates revenue from software licenses  professional service arrangements and software maintenance agreements 
the company recognizes revenue based on the provisions of statement of position  sop  no

and sop no 
 and the provisions of sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
software license fee revenues are generated from licensing the rights to the use of the company s packaged software products 
services and maintenance revenues are generated from sales of maintenance  consulting  training and hosting services performed for customers that license the company s products 
the company has concluded that effective with the new generation of xchange dialogue products released in the third quarter of  certain of the implementation services related to the dialogue product suite are essential to the customer s use of the packaged software products 
similarly  the implementation services for the company s xchange real time and xchange enact products are essential to the customer s use of those packaged software products 
for sales of these products where the company is responsible for implementation  the company recognizes revenue for these arrangements following the percentage of completion method over the implementation period 
percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of implementation hours incurred to date compared to estimated total implementation hours 
this method is used because management has determined that past experience has shown expended hours to be the best measure of progress on these engagements 
in situations where the company is not responsible for implementation services  or where the product configuration being delivered does not require the implementation services deemed to be essential to the customer s use of the software  the company recognizes revenue on delivery of the packaged software if there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance  consulting and training services 
revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
professional services revenue is primarily related to implementation and consulting services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
in addition  the company recognizes services revenue for its application hosting service 
the revenue is recognized over the service delivery period based on either a pre determined monthly service fee or a usage based pricing model 
in certain situations  the company may enter into transactions with third parties to acquire technology from those entities at the same time that the company sells its technology to those same third parties

through june  the company had experienced significant quarterly revenue growth 
however  due to a number of factors  including poor sales execution in the third quarter and the impact of contract accounting on certain of the transactions signed in the third and fourth quarter of  the company realized a decline in quarterly revenue from the second to the third quarter of  as well as a decline in revenues in the second half of as compared to the first half of there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain growth in the future  and our past performance should not be relied upon 
many of the company s latest generation of products  released in the second and third quarter of  have a high dependency on services for delivery of the solution 
the company has concluded that the implementation services are essential to the customer s use of the packaged software products in certain arrangements where the company is responsible for implementation services and therefore will be accounting for those contracts under the contract accounting method as the services are performed 
variability in the delivery cycle of product implementation services  combined with the company s lengthy and variable sales cycle may make predictability of license revenue more difficult 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development  particularly in new and rapidly evolving markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties or that it will be able to achieve or sustain increasing revenues 
transactions with microstrategy  inc 
in december  the company entered into a strategic alliance relationship with microstrategy  inc  resulting in a series of transactions between the two companies 
because the net cash consideration from the transactions described below is significant  the company has accounted for these transactions as monetary exchanges and has recorded them at the fair value of the elements exchanged 
the company agreed to pay to microstrategy an aggregate of million in cash and the company s common stock over the course of two years commencing in december in return  the company will receive the following o licenses for microstrategy applications valued at million for the purpose of developing new products using microstrategy technology along with distribution rights to existing and newly developed microstrategy products on a royalty free basis for years  o a dedicated research and development workforce from microstrategy for a year term valued at million to develop new products using microstrategy s technology  and o prepaid co marketing by microstrategy over months valued at million 
the company has capitalized the present value of the million payments  which totaled million  and is amortizing this amount to operations over the terms of the underlying arrangements  which is approximately months 
as a result of the amortization of the costs associated with these transactions with microstrategy  the company does not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future

interest expense form discount on microstrategy incorporated obligation total interest income expense  net income loss before provision for income provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december   and revenues the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in a number of factors contributed to the increase in total revenues in including additional sales resulting from the expansion of key existing strategic re seller arrangements as well as the establishment of new re seller arrangements  the continued increase in the company s direct sales force  and incremental revenues provided by the exstatic software acquisition 
the company s total revenues increased from million in to million in the factors contributing to this increase include the continued increase in the company s direct sales force  an increase in international sales from the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom and australia  an increase in services and maintenance revenues from the company s growing customer base as well as incremental revenues resulting from product and service offerings obtained through the acquisition of customer analytics  inc in june  including incremental revenue resulting from transactions accounted for under the contract accounting method that had not been fully delivered as of the acquisition date 
software license fees increased from million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in software license fee revenues from to is attributable to the expansion of the company s software license revenues from direct sales to customers both inside and outside of north america  as well as an increase in software license fee revenues from strategic re seller relationships from million in to million in software license fee revenues from direct sales to customers outside of north america were million in as compared to million in software license fee revenues from direct sales to customers inside north america were million in versus million in software license fees increased from million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in this increase was due primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the company s original xchange campaign product  as well as incremental revenue generated by the addition of three new products to the xchange product suite 
during  the company added xchange analytics  xchange enact  and xchange real time to its xchange product offering 
this expansion of the product offering helped the company realize an increase in repeat business sold to the customer install base from of software license revenues in to in  as well as an increase in the average selling price for software transactions from  in to  in in addition in  the company was successful in the distribution of its emessaging product to the value added services providers as a component of their overall managed service offering 
this strategy generated approximately million in incremental revenue in versus services and maintenance revenues increased from million  or of total revenues  in to million  or of total revenues  in the growth of services and maintenance revenues in was directly attributable to million in additional services engagement revenue and million in additional maintenance fee revenues from the company s increased base of customers 
services and maintenance revenues increased from million  or of total revenues  in to million  or of total revenues  in the growth of services and maintenance revenues in was directly attributable to million in additional services engagement revenue and million in additional maintenance fee revenues from the company s increased base of customers 
the decrease in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to the increased contribution of software license fee revenues resulting from the market acceptance of the company s suite of products  including adoption of new technologies brought to market in as the company looks to strengthen its relationships with third party software integrators  such as cap gemini ernst young  ibm global services  and pricewaterhousecoopers it is expected that we will see a shift in some of the services work historically performed by the company to these third party integrators 
however  the company expects to continue the expansion of its service offerings to include newly identified opportunities as well as projects that require unique expertise or familiarity with the company s crm solution set 
in addition  the company s second generation xchange dialogue product set as well as the xchange real time and xchange enact offerings have a high dependency on professional services for successful deployment 
while many of these services will be performed by systems integrators  it is expected that a sufficient amount of domain specific services work will be delivered by the company such that the overall mix of software and services as a percentage of total revenues should remain the same over the foreseeable future 
in  the company s top five customers accounted for of total revenues  while the company s three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues during this same period

in and revenues from the largest customer were comprised of sales through a single re seller to multiple end user businesses 
in  the company s largest customer was microstrategy  inc and included million of revenue from the designation of additional named affiliates to its strategy 
com web service under the terms of the agreement entered into in december cost of revenues total cost of revenues consists of costs associated with software license fees and costs associated with services and maintenance 
total cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues declined from in to in in  cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to of total revenues 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to was primarily attributable to the increased year over year contribution of higher margin software license sales 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue in resulted from the unexpected decrease in revenue in the second half of due to poor sales execution in the third quarter and the impact of the shift to contract accounting for software revenue recognition in a number of transactions entered into in the third and fourth quarter of cost of software license fees in and are comprised of royalty payments made to third parties for licensed intellectual property included in the xchange campaign product  and costs associated with software packaging and distribution 
cost of software license fees as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in  and in cost of software license fees as a percentage of software license fee revenues increased from in to in and in the increase in cost of software license fees from to resulted from increased shipments of xchange campaign software and  therefore  the associated royalty expense payable to third parties and costs associated with software packaging and distribution  as well as an incremental  in royalty obligations associated with the new xchange dialogue for planning module available in this increase was partially offset by the fact that the company s primary royalty obligation in  which was payable on the first million of xchange campaign sales  was fully satisfied by the end of the second quarter the absolute dollar increase in cost of software license fees from to resulted from continued increases in the shipment of xchange campaign as well as an incremental  in third party royalties for components of the new xchange analytics and xchange real time software products released to customers in as the company adds additional components to its software products  the company may choose to license software from third parties 
the cost of such licenses may increase the cost of software license fees in absolute dollars however the company believes that cost of software license fees will remain the same or decrease slightly as a percentage of software license revenues in the foreseeable future 
cost of services and maintenance consists primarily of personnel  facility and system costs incurred in providing professional consulting services  training  hosted software services for the xchange emessaging software product  and customer support services 
cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues was  and in   and  respectively 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue from to was a result of the increased contribution of the software license fee revenues during that period 
during the first half of the company made a conscious decision to invest in the infrastructure and capacity of the services organization in anticipation of the continued increase in software transactions and the related services component 
the company realized an unanticipated slow down in the number of software transactions completed in the third quarter of as a result of general market conditions as well as poor sales execution 
this resulted in a decrease in the number of services engagements and related revenue deliverable in the fourth quarter of the increase in cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of total revenue in as compared to is the result of the decrease in expected services revenues due to poor software sales in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of the company took corrective actions to reduce the cost of services revenues and the benefit of those actions should be realized beginning in the first quarter of cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was   and in  and  respectively 
the slight increase in cost of services and maintenance as a percentage of services and maintenance revenue from to was primarily a result of increased costs to establish the application service provider facilities necessary to deliver the xchange emessaging hosted software business 
the increase in cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of services and maintenance revenue from to was attributable primarily to the impact of the inefficient mix of services resources as it related to realized software bookings in the third quarter 
the company believes that the cost reduction measures undertaken in the fourth quarter of  as well as the increased contribution from higher margin maintenance revenues will result in cost of services and maintenance decreasing as a percentage of both total revenues and services and maintenance revenue 
overall gross margin increased from in to in the increase in overall gross margin from to was primarily due to the continued increased contribution of software license fee revenues in as compared to overall gross margin decreased from in to primarily as a result of the decrease in license fee revenue contribution to the revenue mix in the third and fourth quarters of operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  commissions  travel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  million  million  and million representing  and of total revenues  in   and  respectively 
this increase in expense is primarily attributable to the increase in personnel  promotional activities including trade shows  seminars  and the development of promotional materials designed to increase awareness of the company and its products 
the number of employees in the company directly involved in the sales and marketing effort has increased from in to in and to in the investment in sales and marketing personnel and activities has contributed to the expansion of the customer installation base to over locations and countries 
as the company expands its business into new vertical markets and continues the expansion internationally into europe and the asia pacific region  the company expects to continue to invest resources in the sales and marketing arena 
in order to achieve the revenue growth targets in the future we will not be decreasing the absolute dollars spent on sales and marketing  but instead anticipate an increase in total spending for the foreseeable future 
this fact  combined with the shift to contract accounting for many of the company s software transactions  and the resulting slower year over year revenue growth rates as compared to prior periods  will result in sales and marketing expenses being higher as a percentage of total revenue in as compared to levels in prior years 
it is expected that over the longer term sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue will return to historical levels 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salary and benefits  consultant costs  and equipment and purchased software depreciation costs associated with new product development  enhancement of existing products and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses increased from million  to million and million representing  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars reflects the hiring of additional employees in and additional employees in and additional investments in the company s xchange dialogue  xchange enact  and xchange real time products 
in  with the release of the xchange emessaging product as well as continued market acceptance of the xchange dialogue family of products  total revenues increased at a faster pace than research and development expenditures  resulting in a decrease in total research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues from to in  research and development expense increased as a percentage of total revenue as a result of increased investment in research and development of the xchange dialogue product suite  the xchange real time product  and the xchange enact product coupled with a decrease in year over year revenue growth rates in the second half of as the company continues to commit substantial resources to enhancing existing product functionality and to developing new products  it is expected that research and development expenditures will remain the same both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of annual revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  outside professional fees  and equipment and software depreciation costs associated with the finance  legal  human resources  information systems  and administrative functions of the company 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million representing  and of total revenues  in   and  respectively 
from to  expenses increased in absolute dollars as the company s administrative staffing grew from employees in to employees in and to in in and  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to economies of scale 
in  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue as a result of the significant expansion of the general and administrative support organization to support the doubling of the employee and customer base between and  as well as the impact of the decrease in anticipated revenue during the second half of in addition  the company recorded approximately million of incremental one time charges in associated with the write off of specific bad debts  the increase in the bad debt and sales return allowance  and compensation expense associated with tax exposures on international stock option exercises 
as compared to the spending levels  excluding one time charges  the company expects general and administrative expenses going forward to continue to grow in absolute dollars but at a much slower pace than was realized from to this decrease in growth rates will result in a decline in general and administrative costs in as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of acquisition on august   the company acquired exstatic software  inc formerly known as gino borland  inc exstatic  a company that develops and markets software solutions that enable businesses to plan  create and execute highly personalized  permission based email communications based on customer profiles 
total costs associated with the acquisition of million include approximately  of non cash compensation charges associated with stock options  as well as legal and accounting fees incurred by both organizations 
amortization expense amortization expense for the year ended december  was approximately  consisting of  of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of ksp in march  and ca in june and  of amortization of the microstrategy investment acquired in december impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of customer analytics  inc ca 
see note c in the company s consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense  net net interest income increased from  in to million in primarily as a result of interest earned on proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in december and its second public offering completed in june in  the company reported net interest expense of million which was comprised of million in interest income from cash and investments and million in interest expense 
in  the company recorded million in non cash interest associated with the amortization of the long term obligation from the microstrategy transaction   of interest on notes issued in connection with the ca acquisition  as well as  in interest expense associated with capital leases entered into in or acquired in connection with the ca acquisition 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  of million  or of income before taxes 
the two primary reasons for the high effective tax rate were the million of non tax deductible acquisition costs and  of non tax deductible operating losses of exstatic prior to the august  acquisition date included in the results of operations 
prior to its acquisition  exstatic was structured as a sub chapter s corporation and  as such  the tax benefit of losses incurred through august  reverted to exstatic s principals 
because the acquisition was structured as a non taxable transaction for the exstatic shareholders  the company does not expect to realize any tax benefit from exstatic losses incurred prior to the acquisition 
the company recorded a provision for foreign income taxes in and for net operating profits earned by its international subsidiaries 
however no provision was recorded for federal or state income taxes as the company incurred net domestic operating losses in those years 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated as a result of net operating loss carry forwards in the united states incurred prior to  as the company currently believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized

this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation of such information

in the third quarter of  the company realized a significant decrease in both software license fee revenues as well as total revenues as a result of poor sales execution in the quarters as well as the impact of contract accounting on some of the transactions entered into in the third quarter 
while the company realized an increase in both software license fee revenues and total revenues from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurance that xchange will continue to see positive quarter over quarter growth 
cost of revenues on a percentage basis decreased throughout the quarters presented through june  as a result of an increase in software license fees in the company s revenue mix and the completion of software royalty obligations in the second quarter of the decrease in both total revenues and software license fee revenues in the second half of resulted in an increase in cost of revenues on a percentage basis during that same period 
operating expenses have increased in each of the quarters presented

research and development expenses generally have increased as a result of continued enhancements to the company s crm product offerings  including xchange campaign  as well as the xchange real time  xchange analytics  xchange enact  and xchange emessaging software products 
general and administrative expenses have increased primarily due to additional personnel  facilities and other infrastructure costs 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as predictors of future performance 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance

the company anticipates utilizing the credit facility to secure outstanding letters of credit of million that are currently being cash collateralized 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  decreased million from december  net cash used in operations of approximately million resulted primarily from a loss of million before amortization expense and other non cash charges and the decrease of million in net working capital

the company s revenues from international operations have been denominated in foreign currencies which historically have been stable in relation to us dollars 
as a result  the gain or loss from foreign currency transactions has not been material to its operating results 
as of december   the material assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies include accounts receivable  accounts payable and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the stability of the foreign economies where these assets and liabilities are denominated  the company has not adopted a policy of hedging foreign currency risks 
while it is anticipated that foreign transactions will continue to be denominated in local currencies  the company expects to use hedging instruments to offset potential currency exposures arising as its international operations expand into less stable economic environments 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no

is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors statements in this report concerning the future results of operations  financial condition and business of the company are forward looking statements as defined in the securities act of and the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that information contained in these forward looking statements is inherently uncertain  and that actual performance and results may differ materially due to numerous risk factors  including but not limited to the following our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult 
we began commercial shipment of the initial xchange dialogue for marketing product in july we were not a separate company until november accordingly  we have only a limited operating history in order to evaluate our business 
the risks  expenses and difficulties that an early stage company like ours faces must be considered 
these risks include our ability to o successfully respond to competitive developments  o continue to upgrade our products and service offerings  and o continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
recent events will result in short term losses 
as a result of the expenses associated the transactions with microstrategy inc and the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from the purchase of ca and ksp  we will report quarterly and annual operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
therefore  period to period comparisons of results of operations should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
moreover  our operating results may fall below market analysts expectations in some future quarters 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our business may suffer if our solutions are not accepted by new customers 
we currently derive all of our revenues from our xchange product suite and services related to our crm solution 
we anticipate that these sources will continue to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business will suffer if the market does not accept our solutions and our future enhancements of these solutions 
if demand for our solutions drops as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  our business could be substantially harmed 
the market for crm applications is still emerging and it may not continue to grow 
even if the market does grow  businesses may not adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers about customer optimization software and services in general and about the features and functions of our products and services in particular 
however  our solutions may not achieve any additional degree of market acceptance 
if the market for our solutions fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business would be materially harmed 
we depend on a few industries for most of our sales  and we may not be successful in expanding beyond those limited markets 
a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from sales to telecommunications companies and financial institutions  including retail banks  credit card issuers and mutual fund companies 
we may not continue to be successful in these markets 
in addition  we may not be successful in achieving significant market acceptance in other markets that we target 
the loss of one of our largest customers could cause our revenues to drop quickly and unexpectedly 
in fiscal and  our top five customers accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to do business with us  that business from existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that we will be able to do a significant amount of business with new customers 
if we lose one of our customers  our revenues could drop more quickly than we could reduce expenses 
this could substantially harm our financial results 
we need to manage our growth effectively or we may not succeed 
we have grown rapidly  with total revenues increasing from million in to million in and million in the number of our employees has increased from at december   to at december  our operating and financial systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers have also experienced substantial growth over this period 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems  and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
our failure to expand and integrate these areas in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow  our revenues to decline or to grow more slowly than expected  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business will not grow if we do not keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
because the market for our software products is rapidly changing  our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to enhance our current product line 
we also must develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  fully functional product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by others  our business will not grow and our financial results will suffer 
in particular  our business could be harmed by o any significant errors or bugs in our software shipped to customers  o any delay by customers in making purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced products  o significant delays in the general availability of our new products or releases  o significant problems in the installation or implementation of our new products or releases  or o customer dissatisfaction with our new products or releases 
our stock price or our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to efficiently integrate acquisitions 
we have consummated and we may continue to pursue acquisitions that provide new technologies  products or service offerings 
future acquisitions by us may involve potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 
we also may incur substantial additional liabilities and expenses  such as debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if any of these occur  the market price of our common stock and our financial results could suffer 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including o difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  o the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and o the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
if we are not successful integrating acquisitions  it could increase our expenses and harm our business 
competition could reduce our market share and harm our business 
our competitors may be able to develop products and services that are more attractive to businesses than our products and services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they also may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than us 
if these companies introduce products and services that effectively competed with our products and services  they could be in a position to charge lower prices or to bundle their products and services with their other products and services 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us 
in order to be successful in the future  we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change and competitors innovations 
if we cannot compete successfully with existing or new competitors  we may have to reduce prices on our products  which could lead to reduced profits 
we could also lose market share  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
if we do not successfully maintain our relationships with indirect distribution channels  our sales could decline or could grow more slowly than expected 
we expect to increase the amount of our products that we distribute through various indirect channels 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our distribution partners will be successful in distributing our products 
we rely on the marketing and sales efforts of these organizations  many of whom also market and sell competitive products 
the loss of one or more of our relationships with these organizations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract organizations that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
none of our agreements governing the re seller or co marketing relationships with these organizations includes any commitments on the part of these organizations to effect any minimum number of sales of our products  or otherwise to provide us with business 
if revenues arising from our relationships with these organizations do not exceed historical levels  our business will not grow as expected 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights and others could infringe on or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
the number of intellectual property claims may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
if we do not successfully grow and manage our international operations  our business will suffer 
we have operations in a number of foreign markets 
we currently have customers in more than countries 
we believe that we must expand our sales in international markets in order for our business to grow as planned 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations and hire additional personnel 
if we are unable to do so in a timely and effective manner  our growth in international sales will be limited  and our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have begun to translate our products into different languages and character sets  which may be more difficult or expensive to complete than expected 
in addition  other markets may have longer selling cycles and different product requirements than the united states and we may not be able to successfully adapt our products and methods 
our international operations are also subject to the risks inherent in any international business activities  including  in particular o management of an organization spread over various countries  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  o compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o overlap of different tax structures  and o general economic conditions 
currency fluctuations and general economic conditions in our foreign markets may impact our customers spending and the value of money owed to us 
we have made substantial sales to international customers in canada  denmark  germany  the netherlands  sweden  the united kingdom and china 
our revenues from international operations have been denominated in foreign currencies which historically have been relatively stable in relation to us dollars 
as a result  we have not adopted a policy of hedging foreign currency risks 
if economic conditions in our target markets decline  currencies could fluctuate relative to the us dollar  and our customers could reduce their information technology spending 
our founders  officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over our voting stock and have the ability to make decisions that could adversely affect our stock price 
as of april   our current officers  directors and principal stockholders held approximately of our outstanding common stock and voting common stock equivalents 
consequently  this group will be able to control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including the election of members to our board of directors and the approval of significant change in control transactions  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
representatives of the existing stockholders constitute all five directors and will therefore have significant influence in directing the actions of the board of directors 
we have not identified candidates for additional positions on the board of directors 
we may be subject to future product liability claims 
while our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we may be subject to claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  defending these claims  regardless of merit  could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel 
our common stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the market for securities of most high technology companies  including our common stock  has been highly volatile 
it is likely that the market price of the common stock will continue to fluctuate widely in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include o responses to quarter to quarter variations in our results of operations  o the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  o technological innovation by us or our competitors  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
we have adopted anti takeover provisions that could affect the market price of our common stock or our ability to sell our business 
certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock incentive plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a sale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency treasury bills and notes with an average maturity of less then twelve months 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
foreign currency exchange risk 
with sales and services offices in the united states  united kingdom australia  south africa  korea  singapore  and japan and a global customer base  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposure has been nondollar denominated operating expenses and sales by its united kingdom subsidiary 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union  of which the united kingdom is not a member  occurred in january to date  the company has not seen any impact of the euro on foreign exchange exposure 
in addition  as the company expands its sales and service presence in the asia pacific region in  its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks from the more volatile economies of this region will increase 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the british sterling  euro  or other foreign currency if the exposure becomes material 
as of december  the company s material nondollar denominated assets and liabilities primarily consisted of cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in british sterling and australian dollars
