item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  pertaining generally to the expected continuation of our collaborative agreements  the receipt of research payments thereunder  the future achievement of various milestones in product development and the receipt of payments related thereto  the potential receipt of royalty payments  preclinical testing and clinical trials of potential products  the period of time that our existing capital resources will meet our funding requirements  and our financial results and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below and those outlined in the business section included in item overview we incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in since we were founded  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products for neurologic and endocrine diseases and disorders 
our product candidates address some of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world including insomnia  anxiety  depression  cancer and diabetes 
to date  we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products  and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable future 
we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and payments received under research and development agreements 
we are developing a number of products with corporate collaborators and will rely on existing and future collaborators to meet funding requirements 
we expect to generate future net losses in anticipation of significant increases in operating expenses as products are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in the future  which may be greater than losses in prior years 
results of operations our revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million in  and million in the decline in revenues from to resulted primarily from the conclusion of the novartis collaboration in january and the sponsored research portion of the eli lilly company eli lilly collaboration in october during  we received million in revenues under these agreements  in addition to million in milestones under the wyeth ayerst laboratories wyeth ayerst agreement 
the absence of these revenues during was partially offset by million in revenues received from taisho pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
taisho 
in addition  revenues received from janssen pharmaceutica  nv janssen were million in compared to million received in revenues for and were similar in total but had different compositions resulting from several significant events 
during  we entered into a collaborative agreement with wyeth ayerst and agreed to a two year extension of our collaboration with janssen 
the new agreements generated revenues of million during non recurring revenues recorded in included million in sponsored development and million in milestones received under the novartis and neuroscience pharma  inc npi agreements 
in addition  due to the conclusion of the sponsored research portion of the eli lilly agreement in october  revenues received from eli lilly during were million compared to million received in research and development expenses increased to million during compared with million during and million in increased expenses reflect advancement of our drug candidates through progressive clinical development phases 
we expect to incur significant increases in future periods as later phases of development typically involve an increase in the scope of studies  the number of patients treated and the number of scientific personnel required to manage the trials 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during compared with million during and million in increased expenses from to resulted primarily from million in business development consulting primarily relating to the taisho agreement and million of non cash stock compensation charges relating to the employee stock purchase program and consultant stock options 
increased expenses from to resulted primarily from the addition of personnel required to support expanding research and development activities 
we expect these expenses to continue to rise in as we expand clinical studies 
during  we wrote off acquired in process research and development costs of million 
this amount included the acquisition of northwest neurologic  inc nnl and the in licensing of drug candidates for our insomnia and malignant glioma programs 
both of the in licensed programs are currently under clinical development 
interest income increased to million during compared with million during and million for the increase in  compared with and  primarily resulted from higher investment balances achieved through offerings of our common stock 
we completed a private placement of million shares in december  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in december  we sold million shares in a public offering  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
due to the increase in cash reserves generated from these transactions  we anticipate an increase in interest income during in december  we sold our investment in npi and recorded a gain of  our proportionate share of npi operating losses during and were  and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded a write down in the investment value of  during and million during relating to the decline in cash redemption value of the npi preferred shares 
other income consists primarily of sublease income from unrelated parties 
the fluctuations in sublease income from year to year reflect facility capacity in excess of our needs 
excess space is subleased until it is needed to support company growth 
during  we expect sublease income to decrease significantly as increases in personnel will require more office and laboratory space 
net loss for was million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  and million  or per share  for and  respectively 
the increase in net loss primarily resulted from an increase in scientific personnel and expanded clinical development activities 
we expect operating losses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our clinical development efforts 
to date  our revenues have come principally from funded research and achievements of milestones under corporate collaborations 
the nature and amount of these revenues from period to period may lead to substantial fluctuations in the results of year to year revenues and earnings 
accordingly  results and earnings of one period are not predictive of future periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million compared with million at december  the increase in cash balances at december  resulted from the public offering of our common stock  which generated net cash proceeds of million 
net cash used by operating activities during fiscal year was million compared with million during and million during the increase in cash used in operations during compared with and resulted primarily from the increase in clinical development activities and the addition of scientific personnel 
net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year was million compared to million in and net cash provided by investing activities of million in the fluctuations in cash used and provided resulted primarily from the timing differences in the investment purchases  sales  maturities and the fluctuations in our portfolio mix between cash equivalents and short term investment holdings 
we expect similar fluctuations to continue in future periods 
capital equipment purchases for are expected to be approximately million and will be financed primarily through leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million compared with million and million during and  respectively 
cash provided during includes million of net proceeds from the public offering of our common stock 
cash provided during includes million of net proceeds received from the private sale of our common stock 
cash provided during resulted primarily from capital lease financings 
in july  we licensed to taisho the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize nbi in europe and asia 
in december  we expanded our collaboration with taisho  providing taisho the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our altered peptide ligand apl for diabetes in north america and other countries outside of europe and asia 
with the expanded agreement  we will collaborate in the worldwide clinical development of nbi and we will receive funding for activities we conduct on behalf of the collaboration 
the worldwide collaboration is valued at up to million  including all potential licensing fees  purchase fees  milestones and development expenses 
in addition  we will receive payments based on any future sales of nbi nbi is currently in phase i ii clinical trials  with phase ii trials planned for as of december   we have received million in option fees  million in license fees  million in milestones  and  in reimbursements of third party costs 
the license fees were deferred and are being recognized as revenues over the life of the agreement at  in   in each of the years through and  in in september  we signed an amendment to our agreement with janssen 
the amendment provides for a new sponsored research period designed to identify new corticotropin releasing factor receptor antagonists  which will be subject to the terms of the original agreement signed in the term of the amendment is from april through february under the agreement  we will receive million in sponsored research funding  up to million in milestone achievements and reimbursement of all outside and third party costs associated with the project 
as of december   we have received million in sponsored research and  in reimbursements of third party costs 
in january  we entered into an agreement with wyeth ayerst  the pharmaceutical division of american home products  on the research  development and commercialization of compounds  which modulate excitatory amino acid transporters for the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases 
the wyeth ayerst agreement provides for sharing proprietary technologies  funding for research  payments for milestones reached  plus royalties on sales from products resulting from the collaboration 
under the terms of the agreement  we expect to receive three to five years of funding for research and development as well as worldwide royalties on commercial sales of products that result from the collaboration 
wyeth ayerst will also provide us with access to chemical libraries for screening within the collaborative field 
as of december   we have received million in sponsored research payments  million for the achievement of four milestones and  in license fees  which are being deferred and recognized over the life of the agreement 
during  we expensed acquired in process research and development of million 
these charges consisted of million for the acquisition of northwest neurologic  through which we received licenses to the melanocortin receptor and excitatory amino acid transporters programs  and  for licenses to insomnia and brain cancer compounds 
we performed scientific due diligence related to the acquired projects and because they were based on narrow scientific hypotheses  we concluded that none of these programs had alternative future uses 
the nature and efforts required to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  preclinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process may cost in excess of million and can take as long as years to complete 
it is also important to note that if a clinical candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  safety or a change in market demand 
because of our limited financial resources  our strategy to develop some of our programs is to enter into collaborative agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
through these collaborations  we could partially recover our research costs through contract research and milestone revenues 
the collaborators would then be financially responsible for all clinical development and commercialization costs 
in may  when we acquired the in process research and development programs from nnl  we estimated the costs to identify a clinical candidate and provide minimal research support during the clinical development stages for the melanocortin receptor program to be million over an year period 
costs to identify a clinical candidate and provide minimal research support during the clinical development stages of the excitatory amino acid transporters program were estimated at million 
estimated revenues from the collaborative arrangements were anticipated to reduce our net costs 
the clinical development and commercialization costs were to be completely funded by the collaborator 
during fiscal year  we anticipate that our gross costs for continued research on these programs will approximate million 
our research efforts may not result in clinical candidates for either compound 
we intend to collaborate on the melanocortin receptor technology 
we would expect the collaborator to then be responsible for the clinical development  commercialization and funding 
our excitatory amino acid transporters program is currently under a collaborative agreement with wyeth ayerst 
consequently  we cannot estimate the time or resources they will commit to the development of this program 
our insomnia and brain cancer compounds are both in the early stages of clinical testing 
during  we expect to spend approximately million on additional clinical testing of the brain cancer and insomnia compounds 
we expect the clinical testing of both compounds to continue for at least the next two years  but our efforts may not result in commercially viable products 
if our efforts were completely successful and we did not collaborate on these compounds  we estimate that each compound could cost an additional million and take up to five years to reach commercial viability 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  we may not be successful in achieving commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest income and future payments due under our strategic alliances  will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot guarantee that these capital resources and payments will be sufficient to conduct our research and development programs as planned 
the amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors  including progress of our research and development programs 
we will require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  the cost of product in licensing and any possible acquisitions  and we may require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms  potentially including off balance sheet financing 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
we expect to incur operating losses over the next several years as our research  development  preclinical studies and clinical trial activities increase 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term investments and on our long term debt 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality government and other debt securities 
to minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities with maturities of less than months 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
interest risk exposure on long term debt relates to our note payable  which bears a floating interest rate of prime plus one quarter percent at december   at december  and at december  
at december   and  the note balance was   and  respectively 
this note is payable in equal monthly installments through january based on the balance of our long term debt  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful continuation of our strategic collaborations  the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change and competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties

new accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements  including the recognition of nonrefundable up front fees received in conjunction with a research and development arrangement 
the adoption of this pronouncement was required effective with the fourth quarter of as required by the adoption  we reviewed all up front payments  license fees and milestones received in the current and prior years 
up front payments have been received for program cost reimbursements incurred during a negotiation period 
license fees are received in exchange for a grant to use our proprietary technologies on an as is basis  for the term of the collaborative agreement 
milestones are received for specific scientific achievements determined at the beginning of the collaboration 
these achievements are remote and unpredictable at the onset of the collaboration and are based on the success of scientific efforts 
based on that review  we determined that million of license fees received during were subject to the adoption of sab all other fees received relate to agreements under which the research portion of the collaboration has been completed or the agreements have been terminated entirely 
in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the adoption of sab was recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in the net loss for the fourth quarter of our otherwise reported net loss for the year ended december  was increased by approximately million 
these license fee revenues were deferred and will be amortized as income at  in   in   in   in and  in in march  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  released interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 fin which provides clarification of opinion for certain issues such as the determination of who is an employee  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
we believe that our practices are in conformity with this guidance  and therefore fin had no impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we expect to adopt the new statement effective january  this statement requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements
