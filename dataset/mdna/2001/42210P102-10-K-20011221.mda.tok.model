this licensee did not report and pay certain prior period royalty obligations to headwaters timely  resulting in some catch up revenue recognition in for royalties related to periods other than the year ended september  moreover  this licensee significantly reduced its production and sale of alternative fuel in early and did not operate the four facilities for most of these two factors combined resulted in a decline in recurring license fees from the licensee of approximately  in as compared to this licensee sold the facilities in october and headwaters expects to receive license fees from the new owner in due to increased alternative fuel sales  there was an increase of approximately  in recurring license fees from all other licensees in over in  the largest single licensee accounted for  of earned license fees 
chemical sales 
chemical sales during were  with a corresponding direct cost of  chemical sales during were  with a corresponding direct cost of  the increase in chemical sales in over was due to increased alternative fuel production by headwaters licensees  as well as sales of chemicals to new customers 
there were no similar sales of chemicals to new customers in currently  headwaters expects its future chemical sales revenue from all licensees and other customers to be higher than the amounts reported for due to anticipated increases in alternative fuel production by licensees and increased sales of chemicals to new customers 
headwaters currently expects future gross profit margins to be somewhat less than the record margin percentage for due to differing chemical formula requirements of certain licensees and new customers 
gains on sale of facilities and other transactions 
in  headwaters sold a facility located in pennsylvania on which a loss of approximately  was recognized

total consideration paid at closing  including the direct costs incurred by headwaters to consummate the acquisition  was approximately  additional contingent consideration can be earned by the former hti stockholders in future periods based on operating targets and other milestones 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  a contingent liability of  was recorded  representing the contingent incremental consideration for identified purchased assets in excess of the consideration paid at closing 
a contingent liability was not recognized for the contingent incremental consideration that  if paid in the future  would be recorded as goodwill 
this amount will be adjusted in the future when the actual contingent consideration is paid 
if some or all of the recorded contingent consideration is not paid in the future  some of the recorded asset values will be adjusted accordingly 
if all operating targets and other milestones are achieved  the total additional consideration that could be issued to the former hti stockholders would consist of approximately  in cash and approximately  shares of headwaters common stock

management currently plans to commercialize hti s existing technology domestically and in certain other countries and is currently planning to emphasize catalytic processes and technologies to change coal and heavy oils into other high grade fuels 
approximately  of hti s purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development  consisting primarily of efforts focused on developing catalysts and catalytic processes to lower the cost of producing alternative fuels and chemicals while improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental risks 
this amount represents the estimated purchased in process technology for projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and currently have no alternative use 
the valuation of the in process research and development included  but was not limited to  an analysis of the market for the acquired products and technologies  the completion costs for the projects  the expected cash flows attributed to the projects and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
the estimated value of these projects was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale of those products  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  headwaters recorded a charge for this purchased in process research and development as of the date of acquisition  which is included in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
due to the time required to obtain accurate financial information related to hti s significant foreign operations  for financial reporting purposes hti s financial statements are consolidated with headwaters financial statements using a one month lag 
accordingly  hti s august acquisition date balance sheet has been consolidated with headwaters september  balance sheet  but no results of operations of hti have been included in headwaters consolidated statements of operations for any period

nor any of the other pronouncements reviewed will have any significant effects on its current or future financial position or results of operations
