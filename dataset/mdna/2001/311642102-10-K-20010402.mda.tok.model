currency exchange rate changes resulted in a  reduction on the company s reported cash at december  the company s principal commitments at december  consisted of leases on its headquarters and regional and sales offices 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures at that date 
the company believes that its cash  investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through foreign exchange exposure sales outside the united states represent a significant portion of the company s total revenues 
at present  the majority of the company s revenues and expenses are invoiced and paid in us dollars 
in the future  the company expects a greater portion of its revenues to be denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase 
historically  the company has not hedged against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company at present is evaluating its exposure  and may use foreign exchange contracts and or foreign currency options to hedge these risks in the future

the transition period for the introduction of the euro ends june  after the transition period certain member countries of the european union are expected to adopt the euro as their national currency 
issues facing the company as a result of the introduction of the euro include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  amending lease agreements and other contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
the company is addressing these issues and does not expect the euro to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
