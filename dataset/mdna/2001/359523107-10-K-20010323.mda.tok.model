versus the company operates primarily in the air pollution control business 
it distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
principal markets for its products are stationary combustion sources that produce nitrogen oxide nox and other emissions 
the company sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  a decline of 
this overall decline is due primarily to a  year on year reduction in domestic nox reduction project revenue from utilities 
this result was somewhat offset by a increase in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenue  as particular emphasis was placed on this market segment while awaiting resolution of litigation concerning regulations affecting the domestic utility segment 
international nox reduction industrial project revenues in were behind by  with the decline being attributable to the closure of fuel tech gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company discussed further below and to the completion of a major project in asia in international project revenues were  however  supported by the continued maturation of the western european market  with new business attained in france and italy 
lastly  revenues derived from the sale of fuel treatment chemicals domestically and internationally fell short of levels by and  respectively 
domestically  the negative impact of high crude oil prices early in the year could not be completely overcome by year end gains resulting from the high price of natural gas causing boiler operators to switch fuels back to oil  and the penetration of the company s patented targeted in furnace injection technology 
the decline in international fuel treatment chemical revenues was primarily attributable to a large customer s change in fuels  thus eliminating their requirement for treatment chemicals 
the company believes that the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the environmental protection agency s epa sip call regulation contributed to the decline experienced in in domestic nox reduction utility project revenue 
the sip call is the federal mandate introduced in to further reduce nox in states by may this mandate was an extension of phase ii of title i of the clean air act amendments of caaa 
in may a stay was imposed on this regulation 
on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
subsequent to this court ruling  the stay in the sip call was lifted 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back one year to may of  states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by late october of these plans will potentially impact to utility boilers and to industrial units 
in addition to the sip call regulation  the so called section petitions  which enable downwind states to obtain relief from pollutants arising from their upwind neighbors  require major emissions sources in of the aforementioned states to comply with the aggregate nox reduction requirement by may  the company expects to see project bookings from utilities resume in the first half of due to these regulations 
in  the company and american electric power company  inc aep  one of the united states largest generators of electricity with more than  megawatts of generating capacity  announced that they had executed an agreement for the potential use of the company s selective non catalytic reduction sncr technology on aep s coal fired power plants 
the company will be the sole source sncr provider to aep for the term of the agreement  which expires on the earlier of december  or through the date that aep achieves all required federal  state and local nox and ozone requirements 
the agreement gives aep guaranteed priority status for fuel tech s services on units in aep s generating fleet on which aep decides to use sncr technology during a period of expected increased demand for the technology 
this agreement with aep also provides the company with additional flexibility in an emissions reduction procurement marketplace that will become increasingly dynamic as nox reduction deadlines approach may and may 
the company entered into a similar alliance agreement in may of with another large midwest utility 
as noted above  sales in the domestic fuel treatment chemical segment increased during the latter part of in addition to this recent revenue increase resulting from the increase in the cost of natural gas that has caused customers to switch back to using fuel oil  significant effort is being expended to further penetrate and enter the potentially lucrative pulp and paper and powder river basin coal markets 
the company is directing its sales and marketing efforts toward the penetration of its patented targeted in furnace injection technology towards these segments of the market  where the return on investment to the company s customers can reach in excess of per year 
the gross margin percentage on an overall basis across all products was in  compared with in the improvement was realized primarily due to the reduction in revenues realized from lower margin nox reduction utility projects in the united states in versus  and to the improved margin performance on nox reduction industrial projects 
as nox reduction revenues from utility companies in the united states increase due to the above mentioned regulations  this business will comprise a much larger percentage of the company s overall revenues 
as a result  the company believes that although nox reduction industrial project margins will be sustained  the overall gross margin percentages will gradually decline over the next several years 
the company s net income on a consolidated basis for the months ended december  included a net charge of  related to the restructure of its european operations in an effort to consolidate its business and enhance profitability 
in the second quarter  the company announced that it would concentrate its european resources in its italian company  fuel tech srl  and shut down fuel tech gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary  in germany 
the restructuring consisted of the following transactions  which were recorded at june  fuel tech gmbh s noxout chemical business was sold to a new entity in germany fuel tech cs gmbh in which the company holds a ownership interest that was acquired for  the selling price is dependent on future results of the chemical business  but will not be less than  deutsche marks approximately  paid out over three years

as of december   the company made payments of approximately  related to this charge 
the remaining amount is expected to be paid during the first half of the cumulative foreign currency translation loss related to fuel tech gmbh of  was recognized as other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased by  from the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in revenue based expenses  such as sales commissions to employees and agents  and to a lesser extent  to reductions in controllable expenses 
the company recorded a net loss from its equity interest in affiliates during the year of  this amount consists of a  loss recognized on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  offset by a  gain on its investment in fuel tech cs gmbh

in the opinion of management  the company s revenue growth in the short term will be directly related to the implementation of the requirements of the caaa 
the company s implementor and alliance strategies will enable the company to provide the noxout process to an increasing number of customers without significantly adding technical and support staff 
customers purchase the noxout process and related technologies from either the company or its implementors 
if customers purchase the noxout process from implementors  the per contract revenues to the company may be lower  but more installations may be handled 
versus net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  an increase of 
the increase primarily represents a  increase in domestic nox project revenue and a  increase in asian pollution control revenue 
the gains were marginally offset by a decline in the domestic fuel treatment chemical business 
the domestic nox increase was due to the substantial increase in utility industry air pollution control project revenue caused by the implementation of phase ii of title i of the clean air act amendments of caaa 
in  governors of northeastern states  known collectively as the ozone transport region  signed a memorandum of understanding requiring utilities to reduce their nox emissions by to from levels by may this memorandum favorably impacted the domestic nox utility project performance in the increase in asian revenue was the direct result of one large contract at a korean utility 
the decline in domestic fuel treatment chemical sales was tied directly to the increased market price for fuel oil 
as the price of fuel oil increased in  customers switched their fuel source to natural gas  thus negating the requirement to utilize fuel treatment chemicals 
gross margin percentages were in compared with in the slight decline in margin percentage was due primarily to the impact of low margin air pollution control projects in europe in  which were driven by a highly competitive marketplace 
when excluding this factor  the gross margin on air pollution control revenues as a whole remained relatively flat year on year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased  from due predominantly to selling expenses from accelerated business activity 
interest expense increased by  from the increase was due to the financing required to satisfy the contingent obligation due to nalco as part of the company s purchase of nalco s share of nft
