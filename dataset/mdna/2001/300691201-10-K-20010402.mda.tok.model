item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations overview we develop  sell and support two major product lines our business to bu siness bb line of extensible markup language xml based software products and our obj ect design line of object oriented database management software products 
using our bb products  companies are able to create self service applications running on the internet or an intranet  th at can be targeted to customers  suppliers  channel partners and employees  and that enable companies to transact business more efficiently and effectively  improve customer service and responsiveness and lower transaction costs 
our object design products have been used extensively for over year s by companies in the telecommunications and finance industries  and by independent software vendors  and for over years in electronic business e business applications with demanding requirements for high performance and scalable data management solutions 
until  we derived of our re venue from our object design line of database management software products 
however  during the p ast two years our bb software products line has grown rapidly 
during  sales of bb products a nd services accounted for over million  or approximately  of our total revenues up from less than in our bb product line was introduced in despite a significant inves tment in and a rapid expansion of our bb line of software products over the past two years  the o bject design product line continues to contribute the majority of our revenues 
our object design p roduct line generated more than of our revenues in and more than of our revenues in our revenues are derived from sales of licenses of our bb and object design software products  professional services and maintenance 
we generally license our software pr oducts on a perpetual basis 
maintenance is generally billed annually in advance 
we offer our excel on esolutions and our implementation and other professional services primarily on a time and mate rials basis 
we offer training on a fixed fee basis 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of po sition software revenue recognition 
revenue from software license fees is recognized when th ere is evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management 
revenue from sales thro ugh distributors is recorded net of distributor commissions 
maintenance revenue  including t hose bundled with the initial license fee  are deferred and recognized ratably over the servic e period  generally one year 
consulting and training service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
our cost of software revenues includes primarily royalties to third parties for software used in our software 
our cost of services revenues primarily includes salaries and re lated expenses of our consulting and technical support personnel  and an allocation of overhead and r ecruitment costs 
the following table sets forth certain revenue and cost data as a percentage of our total revenues for each of the three years ended december  revenues software services related party software and services total revenues cost of revenues cost of software cost of services cost of related party software and services total cost of services gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared to software revenues 
software revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased volume of bb software license sales offset partially by a decrease in sales of our object design product line 
we expe ct software license revenues from our bb products to continue to increase in future periods  wh ile our object design product line may stabilize or decline in the coming year 
the timing of closing large sized software deals could result in fluctuations of future software license revenues in any q uarter 
bb software revenues were and million while objectstore software revenues were and million for the years and  respectively 
services revenues 
services revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase is due to higher demand for our consulting services attr ibutable to customer deployments of applications built using our software  and higher maintenance revenues  reflecting continued growth in our installed base of customers 
we are not expecting increases in services revenues for bb services revenues were and million while objectstore services revenues were and million for the years and  respectively revenues from international operations 
revenues from the operations o f our international subsidiaries increased million in as compared to internat ional revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in compared with in t he increase in dollar amount and percentage contribution of our international revenues is primarily the result of strong bb license revenues in japan and the uk 
while we expect that international r evenues will continue to be a large part of our revenues in  it is difficult to predict the perc entage that they will represent 
cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of software revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software revenues is due to additional purchases of technology in the amount of million and an i ncrease in write offs of old technology from million in to million in cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of services revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount reflects the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenues and provide cus tomer support to our growing installed base 
the increase in cost of services as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to lower utilization of consulting personnel in as compare d to as a result of expanding staff in the bb division in anticipation of revenue growth in bb products  as well as a direct write off of purchased technology no longer being utilized by our ser vices organizations 
by hiring staff ahead of demand we caused our average utilization to decline 
in  we expect cost of services revenues to remain flat in absolute dollars  and it may decrea se as a percentage of services revenues as we strive to increase the utilization of our services organizations as new e business customers are added 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense increased  to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue s to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount resulted primari ly from the hiring of additional marketing and sales personnel and increased spending on marketing programs primarily to launch our bb product line 
we do not expect future sales and marketing expenses to increase significantly in research and development expense 
research and development expense increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of total reve nues to in from for the increase was due principally to the addition of person nel  depreciation of capital equipment and related overhead for the development of new bb produc ts and enhancement to existing object design products 
we do not expect future research and dev elopment expenses to increase significantly in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense inc reased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of to tal revenues to in compared to in the increase in dollar amount is reflect ive of the increased staffing  investments in information technology  professional expenses and o ther costs associated with our expanding operations 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase slightly or remain flat in restructuring 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of  in connection with repositioning the company for future growth 
the charge was composed of severance costs for eleven employees  closure costs of some office space  and cancellation costs of certain marketing initiatives 
all of the restructuring charges were paid in other income net 
other income net increased  to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of some movement to longer term inve stments that yield a higher rate of return as well as gains from transactions with our foreign subsi diaries 
provision for income taxes 
in and  we paid only certain foreign in come taxes due to our overall net loss 
compared to software revenues 
software revenues decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased volume of object design soft ware licenses offset partially by an increase in sales of our bb product line 
we expect software license revenues from our bb products to increase in future periods 
services revenues 
services revenues increased  to million in from million in the increase is due to higher demand for our consulting services related to customer deployments of our software and higher maintenance revenues  reflecting con tinued growth in our installed base of object design products

cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues increased  to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of software revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software revenues is due to additional purchases of technology from third parties in for inc lusion in our new bb solutions product line  as well as the write off in of certain previously purchased technologies 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased  to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of services revenues to from for such years  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount reflects the growth in staffing necessary to generate and support increased worldwide service revenues and provide cus tomer support to our growing installed base

the charge is composed of severance costs for eleven employees  closure costs of some office space  and cancellation costs of certain marketing initiatives 
other income net 
other income net increased  to million in from million in the increase was largely the result of overall higher cash balances as well as some movement to longer term investments that yield a higher rate of return 
provision for income taxes 
in  we paid only certain foreign income tax es due to our overall net loss 
our effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate in reflects an alternative minimum tax provision for federal taxes and certain state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity included m illion of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and  of long term ma rketable securities 
 of cash and cash equivalents is restricted and is being held in a c ertificate of deposit with silicon valley bank as collateral for a security deposit on leased office space in our burlington  ma location 
while we believe that our cash and securities balances at december  are sufficient to meet our needs  we are presently negotiating with silicon val ley bank regarding an additional financing package of approximately million dollars 
we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  and a net loss of million for the year then ended 
management believes that cash flows from operation s and existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce c ertain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue as a going concern and achieve its business objectives 
our operating activities used net cash of million and provided net cash of million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  plus increased cash used for wo rking capital 
our investing activities used net cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in uses of cash was attributable primarily to the ne t sale of  of marketable securities in  compared to the net purchase of  of mar ketable securities in  and a decrease in purchased technology to  in from mill ion in our financing activities provided net cash of million and millio n for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to an increase i n proceeds from stock option exercises to million in from million in and the abse nce of treasury stock purchases in we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  and funds generated from operations  if any  will provide adequate liquidity to meet our ca pital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this accounting standard  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or lia bilities at estimated fair value 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued s tatement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
this accounting standard amended the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hed ging activities 
the january  adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operation 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our empl oyees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar statements are intended to identify such forward looking statem ents 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condit ion and results of operations relating to our products  competition  future development  reven ue and expense levels and profitability  as well as the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements  may be forward looking statements 
our disclos ures in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  also consti tute forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements  includi ng without limitation statements regarding the market opportunity for our products  our competitors  the development of our products  the capabilities of our product lines  anticipated increases in revenues from our bb products  the percentage of revenues from our international operations  outlook with regard to costs and expenses  the adequacy of our existing facilities to meet our requirements over the next twelve months  and adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirement s for the next twelve months 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance  but are bas ed on assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made  and in volve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
important factors that could cau se our actual results to differ from those forward looking statements include those set forth be low 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements wheth er in response to new information  future events or otherwise 
in january  we restructured our business operations 
as a result of t he restructuring we reduced our workforce by approximately and split our business operations into three divisions our bb product line division  our object design product line division and a third division that provides finance and administrative functions for the other two divisions 
the restructuring may not produce the improvement in sales and marketing focus  growth in business or rev enues  improvement in our results of operations or other benefits that we anticipate and could  by duplication of senior management and other personnel  increase our operating expenses without rea lizing corresponding increases in revenue 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully manage the transition to our new organizational structure  we could experience disruption of our business o perations that could materially adversely affect our financial results 
disruptions or operationa l difficulties could result in delays in product development cycles and sales of our products 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel following the restructuring or attract and reta in the new personnel necessary to grow our bb product line and object design product line di visions  which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products  support our business operations and grow our businesses 
the occurrence of one or more of these f actors could distract our management team and materially adversely affect our business  financial co ndition and operating results 
the majority of our revenues to date has been derived from our object design li ne of object oriented database management products and related services 
we expect the market for obj ect oriented database management products in general to remain stable or decrease in the future 
our future revenues from our object design product line will depend to a substantial degree on our abi lity both to maintain our existing customers and to attract and maintain new customers for these pro ducts 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our object design product s to customers in a limited number of industries  such as the telecommunications industry  so me of which have been decreasing their rate of capital expenditures  including expenditures for p roducts such as ours 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain demand for our obje ct design products in the telecommunications industry or other vertical markets in which our object design products have been widely implemented 
if our revenues in our traditional markets decline and we are unable to create demand for our object design products in new vertical markets  our re venues could decline  our ability to support the levels of expenditure we believe are necessary to support the growth of our bb business could be impaired  and our business and prospects could be sig nificantly harmed 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fl uctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing  research and developme nt and general and administrative expenses as we develop and expand our bb line of products and s ervices 
because our bb products and services are in the early phase of market acceptance  we do n ot expect to generate sufficient bb revenues in to cover all of the related expenses 
accor dingly  we expect to incur a loss in our failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise a dditional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effe ct on our ability to continue as a going concern and achieve our business objectives 
we believe t hat our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate liquidity to meet our capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
the time for which we b elieve our capital is sufficient is an estimate 
the actual time period may differ materially as a result of a number of factors  risks and uncertainties 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future through public or private debt or equity financing in order to develop new products o r services  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to competitive pressures 
additional financing we may need in the future may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  or if we experience an unanticipated revenue shortfall that requires us to implement personnel red uctions or other cost reduction measures  we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities  de velop new products or services or otherwise respond to unanticipated competitive pressures 
in suc h case  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
our bb product line is currently based in large part upon xml  or extensible markup language  an emerging standard for sharing data over the internet 
while we anticipate that xml will achieve broad market acceptance in the near future  the acceptance of xml within the bb industry has been slower than expected 
it is also possible that a competing standard perceived to be superior could replace xml  in which case the market may not accept an xml based product 
if a new standard were perceived to be superior  our software might not be compatible with the new sta ndard or we might not be able to develop a product using this standard in a timely manner 
conseq uently  a failure of xml based products to achieve broad market acceptance  delay in such acceptanc e or the introduction of a competing standard perceived to be superior in the market could harm our b usiness 
in order to achieve broad market acceptance of our bb product line  we must improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  including by increasing t he visibility of our company and brand recognition of our bb products  by increasing the market re ach and effectiveness of our channel partners  and by increasing the productivity of our sales fo rce 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
if we are unab le to increase the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  we may not be able to att ain planned levels of revenue growth or compete effectively  and our business could be significantly harmed 
the market for bb e commerce solutions is rapidly changing and intensely compe titive 
we expect the market for bb e commerce solutions to continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
for example  the difficulties experienced in recent months by many online retailers and other web based consumer businesses has resulted in reduced demand for our bb products from such busine sses 
as a result  we have been required to reorient our bb sales force and marketing efforts in response to focus on enterprise customers rather than web based consumer businesses 
we may not be able to successfully develop and target our bb products and sales and marketing efforts to such cha nging market demands 
we also expect competition to intensify as the number of entrants and new techn ologies increases 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competito rs 
the competitive pressures facing us  as well as our potential inability to successfully devel op and target our bb products to the changing market for bb e commerce solutions  may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent negative trends in the securities markets and in general domestic and in ternational economic and market conditions have adversely affected  among other enterprises  many companies engaged in internet related businesses 
as a result  our revenues from sales of our pro ducts and services to customers engaged in internet related businesses have declined and may conti nue to decline in the future 
there can be no assurance that such negative trends and decline i n revenues will not continue or worsen or that we will be able to replace the revenue that w e have lost from such customers 
these factors could materially adversely affect our business  fin ancial condition and operating results 
we typically receive the majority of our revenue in the last month of each quarter with a concentration of revenue in the latter half of such month 
this pattern  co mmon to many software companies  makes it difficult to forecast accurately  increasing the poss ibility of missing a quarterly revenue or profit target 
any inability to obtain orders in lar ge volume or to make shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular q uarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenue targets 
any failure t o meet our quarterly revenue or earnings targets could adversely impact the market price of our stock 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales by our international subsidiarie s and to distributors outside the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will b e able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating resu lts on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially adversely affect our business  financial co ndition and operating results 
market prices and trading volumes for securities of software companies have gen erally been volatile 
in particular  our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to s ignificant price and volume fluctuations and may also be affected by broader market trends unrel ated to our operating performance 
such price and volume volatility  as well as general domest ic or international economic  market and political conditions  could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above th e price at which they purchased their shares 
our current and potential competitors include  among others  large software ve ndors  companies and trading networks that develop their own bb integration e commerce solutions  vendors  vendors of proprietary enterprise application integration  or eai  solutions and applicati on server vendors who have added xml capabilities to their products 
in addition  our customers and c ompanies with whom we currently have strategic relationships may become competitors in the future 
ma ny of our competitors and potential competitors have more experience developing internet based softw are  larger technical staffs  larger customer bases  more established distribution channels  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
our competitors m ay be able to develop products and services that are superior to our software and services  that ach ieve greater customer acceptance or that have significantly improved functionality as compared to our existing software and future products and services 
in addition  negotiating and maintaining f avorable customer and strategic relationships is critical to our business 
our competitors may be able to negotiate strategic relationships on more favorable terms than we are able to ne gotiate 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our exist ing and prospective customers 
increased competition may result in reduced margins  loss of sale s or decreased market share  which in turn could harm our business  operating results and financial c ondition 
we depend on product innovation and new product releases to remain competiti ve 
any delay in the release of products or failure of released products to meet the market expecta tion of functionality and features could undermine our competitive position 
furthermore  certain o f our competitors are significantly larger and are expending greater amounts on research and deve lopment and sales and marketing than we are 
the result could be new competitive product introducti ons that could limit the salability of our products or put pressure on sales prices 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
we assume that we will continue to b e able to attract and retain such personnel 
while we have not experienced any significant difficult y in hiring qualified personnel to date  competition for such personnel in the high technology ind ustry is intense 
we experience attrition  and this cannot be predicted 
the failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel  however  could have a material adverse effect on our future operatin g results 
our software is complex and may contain known and undetected errors or perform ance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction of new software or enhancements to existing software 
although we attempt to resol ve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers  our software is not er ror free 
undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future 
our custom ers may perceive such errors to be serious 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our reputation  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
because of the complexity of our software  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of new versions of our software 
in addition  the reall ocation of resources associated with any postponement could cause delays in the development a nd release of future enhancements to our currently available software 
we may not be able to succe ssfully complete the development of future enhancements in a timely and efficient manner 
any such f ailure or delay could harm our operating results 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry s tandards and frequent new product announcements 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our softw are and services 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our software  services or infrastruct ure in order to adapt to these changes 
our business could be harmed if we incur significant cos ts without adequate results  or if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to certain market risks  primarily adverse movements in fore ign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we have not invested in derivative inst ruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe that the fair value of other financial ins truments reflected in our consolidated balance sheets does not represent a significant market risk due to the nature of these instruments and their short term maturities 
we also do not believe that our future earnings  fair values and or cash flows are subject to risk of material near term l oss due to changes in market rates or prices that we consider to be reasonably possible in the near term 
however  our exposure to market risk may change over time as our business practices evol ve  and could in the future materially adversely effect our financial condition and results of ope rations 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expens es in europe and the asia pacific region 
financial risk management the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash a nd cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value at the bala nce sheet date due to the short maturities of these instruments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primar ily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our i nvestment portfolio 
information about our investment portfolio is set forth in note c of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  an d maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders equity 
to date  we have not experienced material losses on our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair val ue of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk fluctuations in exchange rates can adversely effect our results of opera tions and financial position 
the financial statements of our international subsidiaries  all of whose functional currencies are the local currency  are translated using exchange rates in eff ect at the end of the period for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the p eriod for results of operations 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a se parate component of stockholders equity  and also are included in reporting comprehensive inco me 
we also engage in transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses from these tr ansactions  which to date have been immaterial  are reflected in the results of operations 
the impa ct of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition c annot accurately be predicted 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities
