taxable income for the income tax component of the texas franchise tax is the federal pre tax income  plus certain officers salaries  less interest income from federal securities 
total franchise tax expense was  in   in and  in for each of the twelve month periods ended december such expense was included as a part of other noninterest expense 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

 the primary lending focus of the company is on loans to small and medium sized businesses and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company s commercial lending products include business loans  commercial real estate loans  equipment loans  working capital loans  term loans  revolving lines of credit and letters of credit 
most commercial loans are collateralized and on payment programs 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
in almost all cases  the company requires personal guarantees on commercial loans to help assure repayment 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  typically have fixed interest rates and amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a limited extent  nonresidential properties 
construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate 
the company conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the company s construction lending activities 
in keeping with the community oriented nature of its customer base  the company provides construction and permanent financing for churches located within its market area 
the company rarely makes loans at its legal lending limit 
lending officers are assigned various levels of loan approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
loans above  are evaluated and acted upon by the executive committee  which meets weekly and are reported to the board of directors 
the company s strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow conservative loan policies and underwriting practices which include i granting loans on a sound and collectible basis  ii investing funds properly for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  iii serving the legitimate needs of the community and the company s general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  iv ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan  v developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each category  and vi ensuring that each loan is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
the company s loan review and compliance personnel interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  the company has placed increased emphasis on the early identification of problem loans to aggressively seek resolution of the situations and thereby keep loan losses at a minimum 
management believes that this strict adherence to conservative loan policy guidelines has contributed to the company s below average level of loan losses compared to its industry peer group over the past few years 
the company s loans collateralized by one to four family residential real estate generally are originated in amounts of no more than of the lower of cost or appraised value 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
of the mortgages originated  the company generally retains mortgage loans with short terms or variable rates and sells longer term fixed rate loans that do not meet the company s credit underwriting standards 
prior to the acquisition of first american  the company sold such loans to texas independent bank mortgage company  however  since the first american acquisition  the company sells these loans directly into the secondary market 
as of december   the company s one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio was million 
of this amount  million is repriceable in one year or less and an additional million is repriceable from one year to five years 
these high percentages in short term real estate loans reflect the company s commitment to reducing interest rate risk 
the company provides a wide variety of consumer loans including motor vehicle  watercraft  education loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
as of december   the company had no indirect consumer loans  indicating a preference to maintain personal banking relationships and strict underwriting standards 
during the last two years  management has placed tighter controls on consumer credit due to record high personal bankruptcy filings nationwide 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial  industrial and real estate construction loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates in each maturity range as of december   are summarized in the following table december  one year or less after one through five years after five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate construction   total     loans with a predetermined interest rate   loans with a floating interest rate   total    nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
nonperforming assets at december   increased to million compared with million at december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of six credits to nonperforming assets in the fourth quarter of minimal losses are anticipated on these credits due to strong collateral values 
nonperforming assets were million at december  this resulted in ratios of nonperforming assets to total loans plus other real estate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases to accrue interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
loans where the interest payments jeopardize the collection of principal are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual is recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring  however  the company had no restructured loans at either december   december  or december  in addition to an internal loan review  the company retains ibs for an annual external review to evaluate the loan portfolio 
the company maintains current appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at fair value at the time of acquisition  less estimated costs to sell 
the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans  accruing loans past due days or more  other real estate total nonperforming assets     nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas no 
 as amended  a loan is considered impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management has established an allowance for loan losses  which it believes  is adequate for estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security  the evaluation of its loan portfolio through an annual external loan review conducted by ibs and the annual examination of the company s financial statements by its independent auditors 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company follows an internal loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition  the company contracts with ibs to annually perform an external loan review 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans internally classified as substandard or in the more severe categories of doubtful or loss are those loans that at a minimum have clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   a increase 
this increase is due primarily to the classification of two credits of approximately million in loans as substandard during the fourth quarter these classifications were made due to cash flow deficiencies in these lines of credits and are not expected to remain classified as substandard for an extended period of time 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   a decrease 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers the risk classification or delinquency status of loans and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status 
a general reserve allocation is also established primarily based on the company s historical charge off experience 
the company then charges to operations a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology 
management actively monitors the company s asset quality and provides specific loss allowances when necessary 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations

the company continues to hold collateralized mortgage obligations cmos in its securities portfolio 
a cmo is collateralized directly by mortgages or by mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies

 the company accounts for securities according to sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest  which are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
all the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were agency issued collateral obligations 
at december   of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
therefore  the average life  or the average amount of time until the company receives the total amount invested  of the mortgage backed security will be shorter than the contractual maturity 
the company estimates the remaining average life of the fixed rate mortgage backed security portfolio to be less than five years 
mortgage backed securities  which are purchased at a premium  will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities and cmos earn interest at floating rates and reprice within one year  and accordingly are less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december  and million at december  the net change reflects an increase of million or in fixed assets 
the increase is primarily due to major remodeling of the mt 
pleasant and sulphur springs full service locations  the completion of the pittsburg and paris full service bank facilities  and the purchase of additional atm s and computer equipment 
other assets on july   the company invested million in single insurance premium policies 
such policies insured the lives of certain key senior officers 
as of december   the net surrender values of these policies totaled million 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms

fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for two borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  called short term fixed  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from days 
the company does not currently have any borrowings under this program 
as of december   the company does not have any of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
the second borrowing program  the blanket borrowing program  is under a borrowing agreement  which does not require the delivery of specific collateral 
borrowings are limited to a maximum of of the company s one to four family residential mortgage loans 
at december   the company had approximately million borrowed of a potential million available under this program  leaving approximately million in available borrowings

fair values of financial instruments the estimated fair value approximates carrying value for financial instruments except those described below securities fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar instruments 
loans the fair value of fixed rate loans and variable rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality 
deposits the fair value of deposit liabilities with defined maturities and long term debt is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently offered for deposits or similar borrowings of similar remaining maturities 
off balance sheet instruments the fair values of these items are not material and are therefore not included on the following schedule 
the estimated year end fair values of financial instruments are detailed in the following table

the estimated fair values at december  and should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates 
in addition  other assets  such as property and equipment  and liabilities of the company that are not defined as financial instruments are not included in the above disclosures

capital resources and liquidity capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the tdb 
both the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for certain institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations

liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consisted mainly of growth in core deposits  supplemented by investment securities and earnings through operating activities 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
the company s capital ratios are greater than the minimums required by regulatory guidelines 
the company intends to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix 
at december   the company and the bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized 
the company s liquidity management objective is to meet maturing debt obligations  fund loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  and manage operations on a cost effective basis 
management believes that sufficient resources are available to meet the company s liquidity objective through its debt maturity structure  holdings of liquid assets  and access to the capital markets through a variety of funding vehicles 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
the bank s traditional funding sources consist primarily of core deposits  established federal funds lines with major banks  proceeds from matured investments  contracts to repurchase investment securities and principal and interest repayments on loans 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material negative effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material negative effect on the company 
industry segments internal financial information is primarily reported and aggregated solely in the line of business of banking 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
statement establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operation segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operation segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
statement also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company did not identify any reportable operating segments based on the requirements of statement beginning january   a new accounting standard  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  will require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value 
unless designated as hedges  changes in these fair values will be recorded in the income statement 
fair value changes involving hedges will generally be recorded by offsetting gains and losses on the hedge and on the hedged item  even if the fair value of the hedged item is not otherwise recorded 
this standard is not expected to have a material effect but the effect will depend on derivative holdings when this standard applies 
year compliance the company was well prepared for the year changeover and experienced no material problems with its internal systems or in products and services purchased from third parties 
the company is not aware of any problems with its technology based equipment utilized in the ordinary course of its business 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future problems with respect to the year compliance issue 
as required  the company expensed as incurred  all costs associated with year issues 
the costs did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management  and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels in interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital based on the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  commitments to originate loans  and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses an interest rate shock simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are utilized when they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not currently enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
however  it is management s intent to achieve a proper balance so that incorrect rate forecasts should not have a significant impact on earnings 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years greater than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities      loans      federal funds sold   due from banks total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings deposits  certificates of deposit and other time deposits     borrowed funds    total interest bearing liabilities     period gap     cumulative gap     period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the company s one year cumulative gap position at december   was negative million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
the company maintains a rate committee and the alco that reviews the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly or monthly basis  respectively
