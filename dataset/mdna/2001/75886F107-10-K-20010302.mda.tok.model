item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize therapeutic drugs for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of obesity  rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions  cancer and related disorders  allergies  asthma  and other diseases and disorders 
since inception we have not generated sales or any profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates 
below is a summary of our leading clinical programs  as well as several product candidates that are expected to enter clinical trials over the next two years 
we retain sole ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs and currently are developing them independent of any corporate partners 
axokine r acts on the brain region regulating food intake and energy expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity 
in november  we announced the preliminary results of a twelve week phase ii dose ranging trial of axokine in severely obese patients 
in the trial  axokine was generally well tolerated and patients treated with axokine showed medically meaningful and statistically significant weight loss compared to those receiving placebo 
subject to discussions with the fda  we intend to initiate phase iii testing of axokine in severely obese patients in mid pegylated axokine chemically modified version of axokine that is being developed as a more potent  longer acting form of the protein 
pegylated axokine currently is in late stage preclinical development and we anticipate initiating a phase i clinical trial in mid interleukin cytokine trap il trap protein based antagonist for the interleukin called il cytokine 
il is thought to play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases 
in december  we initiated a phase i study to assess the safety and tolerability of the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
we expect the study to be completed in the second half of interleukin interleukin cytokine trap il il trap protein based antagonist for the interleukin and interleukin called il and il cytokines which are thought to play a major role in diseases such as asthma  allergic disorders  and other inflammatory diseases 
we expect to initiate a phase i clinical trial of a dual il il trap for asthma allergy related conditions in late vegf trap protein based antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor called vegf  also known as vascular permeability factor or vpf  which is required for the growth of blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent regulator of vascular permeability and leak 
the vegf trap is expected to enter phase i clinical trials in mid angiopoietins a new family of growth factors that act specifically on the endothelium cells that line blood vessels and may be useful for growing blood vessels in diseased hearts and other tissues with decreased blood flow and for repairing blood vessel leaks that cause swelling and edema in many different diseases such as stroke  diabetic retinopathy  and inflammatory diseases 
selected angiopoietins  including engineered forms of these growth factors are in preclinical development 
in addition to the above programs which we are conducting solely on our own  we have formed collaborations to advance other research and development efforts 
we are conducting research with procter gamble in muscle diseases and other fields 
we are also collaborating with medarex to discover  develop  and commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics 
in partnership with amgen  we are conducting clinical trials with nt for the treatment of constipating conditions 
in all of these research collaborations  we retain of the commercialization rights 
we have not received revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing our research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources and our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and our total revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue from procter gamble increased to million in from million in as increased revenue under the companies collaboration agreement more than offset the termination of procter gamble payments related to axokine research in the third quarter of after procter gamble returned the product rights to axokine to us 
revenue from amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in due to increased clinical trial activity on bdnf and nt in  research progress payments consisted of two non recurring payments totaling million from procter gamble related to its long term collaboration agreement with us and a payment of million reduced by million of japanese withholding tax from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan 
contract manufacturing revenue increased to million in  compared to million in contract manufacturing revenue related to a long term agreement with merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at the company s rensselaer  new york facility increased to million in from million in in  merck revenue was primarily compensation for services rendered related to preparing for commercial production  which began in the fourth quarter of in  merck revenue primarily consisted of payments related to commercial production 
in addition  contract manufacturing revenue in included million related to the manufacture of clinical supplies of bdnf for sumitomo pharmaceuticals in connection with a research and development agreement 
our total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and clinical research programs 
research and development expenses were of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due to higher administrative staffing and related occupancy costs  and an increase in patent expenses related primarily to our acquiring the patent rights to cntf from amgen 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  as a result of improvements to  and purchases of equipment for  the company s facilities in tarrytown  new york and rensselaer  new york 
contract manufacturing expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to costs associated with initiating commercial production at our rensselaer facility of both a vaccine intermediate for merck and clinical supplies of bdnf for sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
our other income  net  increased to million in from million in investment income in increased to million from million in due to interest earned on the proceeds of our public offering in april and our sale of common stock to procter gamble in august the loss in amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in as a result of the partnership s increased clinical trial activity on bdnf and nt interest expense was million in both and during the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  effective as of january  the cumulative effect of adopting sab as of january  was to increase our net loss by million  or per share  with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue which will be recognized in future periods 
the sab adjustment relates to a portion of a payment received from sumitomo chemical in consideration for a fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to license up to three of our product candidates in japan 
in  we recognized contract research and development revenue of million that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  our net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in years ended december  and our total revenue decreased to million in from million in  as higher contract research and development revenue and higher contract manufacturing revenue were more than offset by non recurring research progress payments 
contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in  as revenue from procter gamble increased to million in from million in effective in the third quarter of  research support under our collaboration agreement with procter gamble increased from million per quarter to million per quarter 
however  procter gamble payments related to axokine research declined in as axokine progressed into clinical trials and because procter gamble stopped funding axokine research in the third quarter of after it returned the product rights to axokine to us 
we also earned nominal revenue in from sumitomo pharmaceuticals  compared to million in  as research payments under our research and development agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals ended in and because we did not supply any bdnf to sumitomo pharmaceuticals in for preclinical and clinical use 
in addition  in we received non recurring research progress payments totaling million  consisting of million from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan reduced by million of japanese withholding tax and million from procter gamble in connection with the axokine collaboration 
contract manufacturing revenue related to the long term agreement with merck increased to million in  compared to million in  as a result of increased activity in preparation for manufacturing merck s vaccine intermediate 
our total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and clinical research programs 
research and development expenses were of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in patent expenses related to us and foreign patent filings and higher administrative staffing 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from improvements made to our leased research facilities and offices in tarrytown  new york 
contract manufacturing expenses  which relate directly to our manufacturing agreement with merck  decreased to million in from million in during the fourth quarter of  the united states food and drug administration approved regeneron as a contract manufacturer for the merck intermediate  and we commenced commercial production and began capitalizing manufacturing costs into inventory 
this resulted in a decrease in contract manufacturing expenses  as we discontinued the expensing of pre commercial production costs and began capitalizing inventory costs 
our other income  net  decreased to million in from million in investment income in decreased to million from million in due mainly to lower levels of interest bearing investments as we funded our operations 
the loss in amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in as a result of the partnership s increased clinical trial activity on bdnf and nt interest expense was million in and million in our net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our equity securities  revenue earned under our agreements with amgen  sumitomo chemical  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  and procter gamble  and investment income 
in may  we entered into a long term collaboration agreement with procter and gamble 
procter gamble agreed over the first five years of the collaboration to purchase up to million in regeneron equity  of which million was purchased in june and million was purchased in august  and provide funding in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration  of which we have received million through december  in august  procter gamble made two non recurring research progress payments to us totaling million 
in addition  in august  we and procter gamble agreed through a binding memorandum of understanding to enter into a new long term collaboration agreement  replacing the companies agreement 
the new agreement will extend procter gamble s obligation to fund regeneron s research through december  with no further research obligations by either party thereafter  and focus the companies collaborative research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to procter gamble 
under the original collaboration agreement  research support from procter gamble would have been million per quarter  before adjustments for future inflation  for the period from july through june under the new agreement  beginning in the first quarter of  research support from procter gamble will be million per quarter  before adjustments for future inflation  through december our activities relating to bdnf and nt  as agreed upon by amgen and us  are being compensated by amgen regeneron partners for services rendered  and we recognize these amounts as revenue 
in january  amgen regeneron partners discontinued all development of bdnf for the potential treatment of als 
we and amgen fund amgen regeneron partners through capital contributions  and must make equal payments in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from the partnership 
our aggregate capital contribution to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  was million 
we expect that our capital contributions for will total at least million 
these contributions could increase or decrease  depending upon  among other things  the nature and cost of ongoing and additional nt studies that amgen regeneron partners may conduct  the outcomes of those studies  and costs associated with the discontinuation of the bdnf studies 
in connection with our agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  sumitomo pharmaceuticals paid us million through december we also received research progress payments from sumitomo pharmaceuticals of million reduced by million of japanese withholding tax in august and million reduced by million japanese withholding tax in april in addition  sumitomo pharmaceuticals has paid us million through december  in connection with supplying bdnf for preclinical and clinical use and is obligated to pay us another million for materials shipped at the end of in light of the recent bdnf clinical trial results  it is likely that sumitomo pharmaceuticals will exercise its discretionary right to terminate the license with us for bdnf and  other than amounts outstanding at december  and any wind down costs  we would not expect to receive further payments from sumitomo pharmaceuticals for research progress payments  contract research and development  or contract manufacturing 
we invested million in  million in  and million in in property  plant  and equipment 
in addition  we leased million of equipment in in connection with the purchase and renovation of our rensselaer facility  we obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation in  of which million is outstanding 
under the terms of this udc financing  we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends on our equity securities 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
in september  immunex filed a request with the european patent office seeking the declaration of an opposition regarding our european patent relating to cytokine traps 
this is a legal challenge to the validity and scope of our patent and we may incur substantial expenses in defending the patent 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
we may seek additional funding through  among other things  future collaboration agreements and public or private financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in august  we sold  shares of common stock to procter gamble at a price of per share and received total proceeds of million 
the sale of stock to procter gamble was made pursuant to a securities purchase agreement 
in january  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for a proposed offering of million shares of our common stock  with an additional  shares available to cover an over allotment option 
we cannot assure you that our proposed offering will be declared effective or  if declared effective  how many shares of our common stock will be sold  what the stock s selling price per share will be  or what our net proceeds will be from the offering 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we expect to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  expansion and validation of manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment 
we currently anticipate that for and  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including axokine  pegylated axokine  il trap  il il trap  vegf trap  nt  and the angiopoietins  approximately of our expenditures will cover our basic research activities  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the continued development of our novel technology platforms  including potential efforts to commercialize these technologies  and the remainder of our expenditures will be for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital 
the amount we need to fund operations and the allocation of our resources will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research arrangements including those with procter gamble  medarex  emisphere  and amgen 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through the third quarter of however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and we cannot assure you that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards there are a number of recently issued accounting standards  including statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities  which we will be required to adopt in future periods 
our management believes that the future adoption of these accounting standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results we caution stockholders and potential investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  us 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose delay  difficulty  or failure of our research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by us or others 
cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements including in particular  but not limited to  those with procter gamble and amgen and the resulting loss of research or other funding could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations 
a change of control of one or more of our material collaborators or licensees could also have a material adverse effect on us 
delay  difficulty  or failure of a clinical trial of any of our product candidates 
a clinical trial can fail or be delayed as a result of many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining patients  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our drug candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical experiments and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been successfully completed 
patients who have been treated with axokine and nt have developed antibodies  though we have no information that indicates that these antibodies are neutralizing antibodies 
delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval including approval of our facilities for production for our products  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy 
increased and irregular costs of development  manufacture  regulatory approval  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
competitive or market factors that may cause use of our products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to fund the cost of developing product candidates 
amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses  and the impact of unusual charges resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies and organizational structure 
failure of corporate partners to develop or commercialize successfully our products or to retain and expand the markets served by the commercial collaborations  conflicts of interest  priorities  and commercial strategies which may arise between our corporate partners and us 
delays or difficulties in developing and acquiring production technology and technical and managerial personnel to manufacture novel biotechnology product in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
difficulties in obtaining key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates 
the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil  such as product or employment related  or environmental  or criminal  settlements  and investigations  developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and licenses  the issuance and use of patents and proprietary technology by us and our competitors  including the possible negative effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell our products in circumstances where we are unable to obtain licenses to patents which may be required for our products 
underutilization of our existing or new manufacturing facilities or of any facility expansions  resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs  start up costs  inefficiencies  delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions 
health care reform  including reductions or changes in reimbursement available for prescription medications or other reforms 
difficulties in attracting and retaining key personnel 
as our scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of our current areas of experience and expertise  we will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which we currently do not have substantial resources and personnel 
to date  we have received revenues from our licensees and collaborators for research and development efforts  merck and sumitomo pharmaceuticals for contract manufacturing  and investment income 
we may not continue to receive these revenues from our licensees  collaborators  or contract manufacturing customers 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 
we do not know if we will ever have an approved product or achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
we do not expect to receive any revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates for several years and we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development activities 
even if we do successfully develop products that can be marketed and sold commercially  we will need to generate significant revenue from products to achieve and maintain profitability 
most drug research and development programs never lead to the development of commercially successful products 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we are attempting to develop drugs for human therapeutic uses  and our research and development activities may not be successful and none of our potential product candidates may ever complete clinical trials 
even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payors and on our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market our product candidates 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
