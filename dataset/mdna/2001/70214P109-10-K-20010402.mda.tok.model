gross revenue represents total subscription and advertising sales made during the period  of which a portion is deferred and recognized as earned 
net revenues represent that portion of current and prior year s gross revenues that was earned during the period 
sales costs  including commissions  are expensed as incurred  and are included in the cost of revenue 
deferred revenue  net increased to  at december   compared to  as of december  the following table sets forth gross revenue by product line for each of the four quarters in fiscal year  as well as sequential quarter to quarter revenue growth percentage for the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal year gross revenue by product line s year ended december  three months ended sequential growth nd qtr rd qtr th qtr subscription     advertising other  total     cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  telephone expenses  web site development costs  contract payments to a third party for procurement data functionality and a proportion of rent and office expenses

as a percent of sales  costs of revenues  excluding stock based compensation  were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase of  in cost of revenues  excluding stock based compensation for fiscal year is an increase of  in commissions to our salespeople  and information technology costs totaling  incurred in  which include contract payments totaling  to a third party for government procurement data functionality  that were not incurred in at december   we employed persons in sales and marketing and persons in customer support  compared with in total at december  operating expenses for fiscal years and  our operating expenses  including stock based compensation expense  were  and  respectively  an increase of  or from the prior year

the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments in fiscal year is attributable to our ipo that raised  in net proceeds 
in addition  as of december   the company owned a one year certificate of deposit  maturing on june   in the amount of  which is used to secure a standby letter of credit the company was required to obtain in connection with the sublease agreement 
such certificate of deposit is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the december  balance sheet of the accompanying financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  the timing of extended service offerings  the success of these services once they are launched as well as the extent to which we engage in acquisitions or investments 
any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financings  or other arrangements 
any additional financings  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  such a failure to raise needed capital could impair our future plans to expand our e marketplace  attract new members  and provide new and upgrade current services to our members 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  additional dilution to existing shareholders could result 
in addition  any equity securities issued might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
cash flows net cash flows used in operating activities were   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for fiscal year was primarily the result of increased expenditures for sales and marketing  information technology  and general and administrative expenses to coincide with the company s expansion 
net cash flows used in investing activities were   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year includes the purchase of current and non current investment securities totaling  and an increase in expenditures resulting from purchases of personal property and equipment for the new facility  including computer hardware and software commensurate with the ramp up of the sales staff 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year is primarily the result of net proceeds of  received by partsbase in connection with the issuance of common stock related to the company s ipo  offset by the purchase for treasury of  shares of our common stock  totaling  new accounting guidance in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities by deferring the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas was amended in june by sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities as indicated by sfas the company will adopt sfas in fiscal year the company currently does not engage in  nor does it expect to engage in  derivative or hedging activities  and therefore  the company anticipates there will be no impact to its financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf d accounting for payroll taxes with stock option exercises 
when nonqualified stock options are exercised  the difference between the exercise price paid and the fair value of the acquired stock on the exercise date intrinsic value is considered ordinary income for purposes of determining the employee s federal income taxes 
the employer is entitled to a federal income tax deduction in the period the option is exercised of an amount equal to the employee s ordinary income 
also  the intrinsic value of the exercised options is considered the equivalent of compensation paid directly to the employee and  therefore  the employer must pay medicare taxes  and perhaps fica taxes  depending on the employee s aggregate compensation level 
the fasb staff believes that payroll taxes  even though directly related to the appreciation on stock options  are operating expenses and should be reflected as such in the statement of operations 
the company adopted eitf d for employer payroll taxes incurred on stock options exercised during fiscal year no stock options were eligible for exercise during fiscal and all such payroll taxes were recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which among other guidance  clarifies certain conditions to be met in order to recognize revenue 
in october  the staff deferred the implementation date of sab until no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  the company has conformed its income recognition policies to sab during fiscal year  and such conformity had no impact to its financial statements as of december  in july  the eitf issued classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit realized by a company upon employee exercise of a non qualified stock option eitf 
this issue addresses the cash flow statement presentation of the windfall tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock options 
companies receive an income tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of a nonqualified stock option upon exercise by the employee 
eitf concludes that the income tax benefit realized by the company upon employee exercise should be classified in the operating section of the cash flow statement 
the eitf is effective for all quarters ending after july  the company adopted eitf as of july  for non qualified stock options exercised by employees and such adoption had no impact to its financial statements as of december  since the company has no taxable income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
interest rate risk the primary objective of investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
at december   our portfolio consisted of investments in institutional money market funds  government paper  and a rated or higher corporate bonds see note to the financial statements 
our investment policy is focused on ensuring that we have liquid cash balances available to meet our day to day operating cash needs 
the policy establishes guidelines for the investment of surplus cash balances that will maximize return with minimum credit and liquidity risk 
all investments are held in us dollars 
specific instruments approved for inclusion in the portfolio are limited to obligations issued by the us treasury and us federal agencies  obligations of us commercial banks such as bankers acceptances and certificates of deposits and obligations of major corporations and bank holding companies such as direct issue commercial paper and medium term notes 
we intend to hold our investments until maturity  however  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and change in the market values of our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange risk we have minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as all of our sales to customers outside of the united states are collected in us dollars
