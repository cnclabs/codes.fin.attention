liquidity and capital resources historically  we financed our discontinued operations through a combination of internally generated funds  equity financings  subordinated borrowings and bank credit facilities 
we used our bank credit facilities to fund our investment in accounts receivable and inventory necessary to support our historical businesses 
in connection with our decision to focus on our e commerce business  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through an equity financing with softbank in july we used part of the proceeds from this financing to repay the balance on our then outstanding lines of credit  reduce trade payables and provide operating capital related to our historical businesses 
we also used part of the proceeds to acquire property and equipment and fund the working capital needs of our e commerce business 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
on april   we received approximately million in gross proceeds through a mortgage financing of our corporate headquarters 
on april   we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through an equity financing with softbank and tmct 
on september   we raised million in gross proceeds and on october   we raised million in gross proceeds  through an equity financing with ith 
see company background section above 
we used the proceeds of these financings for additional working capital needs and general business purposes  including the acquisition of property and equipment required to operate our e commerce business 
we have incurred substantial costs to develop our e commerce business and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our creative  engineering  marketing  merchandising  customer service  management information systems and administration departments 
as a result  we incurred substantial losses in fiscal and fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in order to expand our e commerce business  we intend to invest in operations  web site development  merchandising and additional personnel in certain areas of the business 
in addition  during fiscal  we invested in the required technology  equipment and personnel to make our kentucky distribution center fully operational 
based on these factors  we can expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we used approximately million in net cash for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal and approximately million in net cash for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal net cash used for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  offset  in part  by changes in refundable income taxes  deferred revenue  accounts payable and accrued expenses  stock based compensation expense  and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used for operating activities of continuing operations during fiscal was primarily the result of net losses from continuing operations and changes in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  refundable income taxes and income taxes payable  partially offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses  deferred revenue  stock based compensation expense  and depreciation and amortization 
our investing activities during fiscal consisted of purchases of property and equipment 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal also  during fiscal  we received million in cash proceeds from the sale our off price and action sports division and million in net cash received from the acquisition of fogdog 
during fiscal  our investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment of million 
in addition  we received million in cash proceeds from the sale of our branded division during as of december   we had commitments of approximately million relating to the implementation of advertising and promotion programs 
to date  we have financed our e commerce operations primarily from the sale of equity securities 
management expects that our current cash and the collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  our revenues must increase significantly to internally fund our anticipated operating expenses 
if cash flows are insufficient to fund these expenses  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financings or other arrangements to fund our operations until we achieve profitability 
failure to raise future capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in institutional money market accounts  certificates of deposit and debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers 
in order to minimize risk and credit exposure  we invest in institutional money market accounts with three financial institutions 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or it may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt consists of a million mortgage note on our corporate headquarters 
the interest rate on the note is fixed at per annum over the ten year term of the note
