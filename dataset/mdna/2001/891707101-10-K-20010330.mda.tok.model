the company estimates its capital expenditures will approximate million 
under present conditions  management does not believe access to funds will restrict its ability to pursue its business strategy 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
management believes that inflation has not significantly affected the company s business over the past months 
however  because selling prices generally cannot be increased until a model changeover  the effects of inflation must be offset by productivity improvements and volume from new business awards 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company s policy is to not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company periodically enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are entered into as a hedge of underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instrument 
therefore  these interest rate swap agreements convert outstanding floating rate debt to fixed rate debt for a period of time 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   tower automotive had total debt and obligations under capital leases of billion 
the debt is comprised of fixed rate debt of million and floating rate debt of million 
the pre tax earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would be approximately million  holding other variables constant 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the fixed rate debt 
a portion of tower automotive s and revenues were derived from manufacturing operations in europe  asia and south america 
the results of operations and financial position of the company s foreign operations are principally measured in its respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in europe  asia and south america are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currency in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a portion of tower automotive s assets at december  and are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  the company s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
the company s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  engage in hedging programs intended to reduce the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
as of december   the company held no foreign currency hedge positions 
management believes the effect of a one percent appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency rates would not materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations for the years ended december  and year the company completed its effort in resolving the impact of the year yk on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized and embedded systems 
the company experienced no significant business interruption as a result of yk  either internally or externally from suppliers 
the company does not anticipate any further impact relating to date sensitive information processing capabilities 
the company spent approximately million during the year ended december  on yk readiness activities
