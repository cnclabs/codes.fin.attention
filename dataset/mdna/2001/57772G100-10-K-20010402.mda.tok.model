item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s revenues currently are derived primarily from commissions related to its inter dealer brokerage businesses 
generally  the company receives a commission from both counterparties in a trade  although in trades of certain products only one party pays a commission 
the dollar amount of the average transaction generating a commission varies significantly by the type of product and the duration of the transaction 
similarly  the applicable commission will vary according to product and services required and may also reflect discounts for high transaction volumes or other client rebates 
other sources of revenues include interest income  derived primarily from cash and cash equivalents  deposits with clearing organizations and interest associated with municipal securities positions  gains and losses on securities transactions currently primarily in connection with the company s municipal securities business  income from the sale of data and financial information generated from the company s brokerage businesses  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
the largest single component of the company s expenses is compensation paid to its brokers 
attracting and retaining qualified brokerage personnel with strong client relationships is a prerequisite in the company s business and in the brokerage business in general 
brokers are generally compensated by a combination of fixed salary and incentive payments based on commissions generated by them or on the net profitability of their respective departments 
for this reason  compensation expense frequently will increase or decrease in rough proportion to revenues  although the fixed salary component can skew the correlation in businesses with declining revenues by causing decreases in compensation to lag behind decreases in revenues  and starting bonuses for new hires in businesses for which revenue growth is sought can increase compensation expenses in advance of realizing the anticipated revenue growth 
to manage this area  the company includes performance based salary adjustment provisions in substantially all of its broker contracts and closely tracks revenues and compensation expenses as well as other direct costs by department which may involve one or more products and by broker  at each location 
direct client contact  including entertainment  is also an integral part of the company s marketing program and represents another significant component of its expenses 
the company has made it a priority to manage these expenditures in a more focused and coordinated fashion  and has had reasonable success in reducing their gross levels over each of the last three years 
the costs of maintaining sophisticated trading room environments and a worldwide data and communications network comprise another significant portion of the company s expenses  and  with the usage of electronic execution and matching systems  the need to invest in new technology and internet deployment strategies has also increased 
the company s ability to compete effectively is significantly dependent on its ability to maintain a high level of client service  through its proprietary software  computerized screen displays and digital networks  the tradesoft system  the meb system and the company s provision of whatever additional systems are demanded by clients at any given time 
it is this infrastructure and technological commitment that enables the company to support its existing client base and product lines  as well as provide a platform for offering brokerage or other services in additional or newly developing financial instruments 
although the company maintains sizeable management information services and communications departments  the company will also license technology or outsource infrastructure or technology projects  where practical and consistent with its business goals  in order to manage its fixed costs in these areas 
to grow revenues and stay competitive  the company constantly needs to analyze and pursue growth opportunities in both new and existing product lines 
product expansion  when undertaken  however  generally leads to an increase in the number of brokerage personnel  and therefore in compensation expense  since the markets usually require brokers to specialize in a single product or group of related products  rather than function as market generalists 
product expansion  and the effort to grow market share  also typically results in increased entertainment expenses and the increased infrastructure and communication costs associated with configuring a new desk and delivering its product to the necessary client base 
year ended december  the year ended december  was an uneven one for the company  with operating performances during the first three quarters that were not fully up to the company s expectations  mitigated in part by the company s ability to recognize a significant first quarter gain on the strategic restructuring of its tokyo operations  followed by improvements in fourth quarter performance that have carried over into initial results for the first quarter of net income for the full year was approximately million  or 
per share  on total revenues of million 
based on results to date  the company anticipates earning in excess of million on an operating and net income basis  or more than 
per share  solely in the first quarter of management undertook and implemented a number of initiatives during that the company believes helped both to address weaknesses in operating performance during the year and position the company for its strong start in these included the launching of a number of technology initiatives designed to enhance the company s services to clients  including the acquisition of an electronic trading platform developer  the refinement and further deployment of a proprietary middle office trade processing system  and the licensing of a third party secure e mail trade confirmation system 
they also included the further expansion of the company s brokerage products to include us government agency bonds  the closure of two marginal and under performing foreign offices  the exit of the company from brokering certain energy derivatives where the company s market share penetration was inadequate to maintain profitability  the completion of the company s strategic restructuring of its tokyo operations  the continued reduction of the company s outstanding debt borrowings  and the initiation of an open market repurchase program for the company s common stock  all as more fully described below 
the year started with the company completing the merger of the tokyo partnership  the tokyo based derivatives brokering venture in which the company had been a economic partner with its equity affiliate  yagi euro  with the off balance sheet brokerage operations of nittan 
the combination saw the company retaining a direct interest in the expanded tokyo partnership  with yagi euro retaining a interest and nittan acquiring the remaining 
as a result of the transaction  which closed effective january   the company recognized a one time  after tax gain in the first quarter of of approximately million 
the company throughout the year continued its strategy of focusing on its three core financial centers of new york  london and tokyo 
this focus resulted in the closure of the company s toronto based operations  effective june   at an approximate cost of  and the taking of a charge of approximately  during the fourth quarter for the decision taken to close the paris branch operations of the company s venture with finacor  ebfl  in early january both the toronto and paris operations were relatively small  but had been losing money for some time and were no longer considered viable as self sustaining offices 
the company continued its efforts to grow revenues and improve profitability by expanding into new products when it found reasonable business opportunities to do so 
near the end of  the company began taking steps that enabled it to hire a core of experienced brokers from several competing firms and establish a brokerage service in us government agency debt 
the company is optimistic about the prospects for the new department  which began formal operations in february with the reduction in issuances of the year treasury bond  us government agency bonds are evolving into an increasingly used benchmark and hedging tool 
the product also compliments several of the company s other departments  such as interest rate derivatives  repurchase agreements and overnight federal funds 
on the other hand  the company did not hesitate to exit businesses in where its market share penetration was proving inadequate to achieve profitability 
in this regard  the company s energy derivatives businesses  which had already been streamlined in  were further cut back  with the company halting its brokerage of weather derivatives in the second quarter and its brokerage of electricity related products and derivatives in the third quarter 
the company countered these trends somewhat by establishing a bandwidth brokerage operation in the latter half of  and continues to maintain energy related businesses in the brokerage of emission credits and coal 
the company s business has always been sensitive to prevailing economic and market conditions  and  in particular  trading levels in the fixed income and derivatives markets in which it is active  and in this respect saw wide fluctuations 
the year began with significant uncertainty surrounding the potential effects of yk  which negatively affected trading levels  particularly in emerging markets  and quickly moved to a state of euphoric market expectation in  and focus on  equities 
by the end of the year  however  the equity markets were battered by a steep market correction and worldwide economic slowdown  and financial market participants were realigning their risk profiles 
combined with a declining interest rate environment  the market saw increased levels of activity both in fixed income and interest rate derivative products  which helped the company s brokerage levels in the fourth quarter 
on the technology front  the company continued its efforts to deliver its clients the most advanced brokerage services possible  while also exploring the expansion of its business model into the provision of financial services related technology and systems 
the most significant step in this direction was the company s third quarter acquisition of the privately held tradesoft technologies  inc tradesoft  a developer and licensor of electronic trading platforms  for a combination of million in cash and  shares of common stock 
in the third quarter of  the company had entered into a licensing agreement with tradesoft for the development of an electronic matching system to broker brady bonds and global bonds 
the completed application  which was deployed to some of the company s largest clients in emerging markets during the first half of  received significant accolades for its functionality and ease of use 
as a result of the acquisition of tradesoft  the company now owns instead of licenses the tradesoft system and its related software  and can manage and direct its further development and modification for other products and uses  as well as directly benefit from any revenues generated by third party licensing arrangements 
more recently  the company utilized tradesoft s know how and software to automate the broker interface on its new us government agencies desk 
deployment of the interactive trade execution element on the client end is expected ultimately to follow  but only as an adjunct to voice brokerage operations for those clients who desire it  and not as a substitute 
the company believes that this hybrid approach  which marries quality voice brokering and advanced screen system technology  offers a better opportunity to expand its inter dealer brokerage business and grow revenues than the model that looks to achieving total electronic execution and automation 
moreover  because the approach is geared to developing and maintaining genuine internal broker support for the tradesoft system and its related technology  the expectation is that it will build on existing voice brokerage liquidity  rather than cannibalize it to move a small portion of that liquidity to a fully electronic platform 
the company accordingly is also exploring whether and how to modify its prior deployment of the tradesoft system in emerging markets  where neither its fully electronic execution application nor those of competitors have been successful to date in garnering meaningful liquidity 
the company in also continued to modify and fine tune the meb system  its proprietary middle office trade processing system that also incorporates an electronic touchpad blotter application for capturing trade information 
these efforts included deploying the meb system across the company s repurchase agreement operations and its new us government agencies desk  as well as developing an interface to feed data directly from the tradesoft system front end into the meb system 
although to date the meb system has only been deployed internally  the company believes that there may be an untapped revenue potential in licensing the meb system and its unique technology and risk management features to third parties 
the third quarter of also saw the company s licensing of a secure e mail trade confirmation system from postx corporation  with anticipated deployment of the system in mid the system represents an additional element in the company s strategy of using advanced technology to provide the best possible client service 
upon its anticipated deployment within the company s derivatives department  the system is expected to enable the company to offer its client base the advantage of secure  encrypted trade confirmations delivered by e mail promptly after execution  and the ability to respond immediately with secure e mail verifications or queries 
after repurchasing  shares of common stock in mid in a single  negotiated transaction at a price of per share  the company s board of directors in may authorized an open market repurchase program for up to of the outstanding common stock  or  shares 
by mid january  the company had completed the repurchase of the full  shares authorized under the program  at an average price of per share 
the board of directors then increased the authorization under the program to allow the repurchase of up to an additional  shares  or of the common stock outstanding at that time 
as of march   the company had repurchased an additional  shares pursuant to this extension of the program  at an average price of per share 
management recommended and implemented the repurchase program in the belief that the common stock at the market valuations then prevailing represented an attractive long term investment for the company and would increase value for the company s remaining stockholders 
the year also saw the company continue the process of paring down its already low level of debt  ending the year with notes and loans payable at a historically low level of million  down from million at year end and million at year end 
these management initiatives were implemented in a business and marketplace environment that continues to be extremely competitive and challenging 
the company s primary client base continues to undergo consolidations  resulting in surviving financial institutions that are increasingly large and have greater purchasing power  as well as fewer market participants 
in addition  the inter dealer brokerage business continues to see new entrants in the form of electronic marketplaces  often with significant capital markets backing 
several have been established by existing money and securities brokers  others by consortia of banks and institutional market participants  and some with a combination of both 
the company believes its own technology initiatives and assortment of product offerings have to date positioned it to meet these competitive threats  but the landscape is constantly evolving and the company continuously needs to adapt its business methods and strategies

effects of inflation because the company s assets are to a large extent liquid in nature  the company believes it is less susceptible to the negative effects of inflation than companies with high levels of inventories or fixed assets exposed to increasing replacement costs 
moreover  to the extent the earning power of the company s liquid assets diminishes in an inflationary environment  the effects tend to be offset by the salutary consequences of inflation on the true cost of paying the company s current liabilities 
however  increases in certain company expenses due to inflation  such as employee compensation  travel and entertainment and occupancy and communication costs may not be readily recoverable in the price of its services 
in addition  to the extent inflation increases or decreases volatility in the securities markets  the company s brokerage business is likely to be affected by corresponding increases or decreases in brokerage transaction volumes 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this item and elsewhere in this report  as well as other oral and written statements made by the company to the public  contain and incorporate by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of wherever possible  the company has identified these forward looking statements by words such as believes  anticipates  expects and similar phrases 
such forward looking statements  which describe the company s current beliefs concerning future business conditions and the outlook for the company  are subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
actual results or performance could differ materially from that expected by the company 
uncertainties include factors such as market and economic conditions  the success of technology development and deployment  the status of relationships with employees  clients  business partners and clearing firms  possible third party litigations or other unanticipated contingencies  the actions of competitors  and government regulatory changes 
for a fuller description of these and additional uncertainties  reference is made to the competition  regulation and cautionary statements captions of item of this report  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations caption of item of this report and the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk caption of item a of this report 
the forward looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this report and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of the company is actively involved in the evaluation of risks associated with certain financial instruments and will from time to time reduce other risks inherent in its businesses through the use of financial instruments 
the company reduces market risk related to its municipal securities positions by limiting both the size of its overall positions and the number of days positions are held 
in addition  the company from time to time sells interest rate sensitive financial futures contracts as a means of managing market risk on its municipal securities positions 
management closely monitors the company s municipal securities positions on a daily basis through its review of daily activity and position reports prepared by operations staff 
these reports detail all executed transactions  the resulting trading gains and sales commissions and  using independently verified market prices  the closing positions 
at december   the company held municipal securities positions with an aggregate market value of approximately million 
in the process of executing brokerage transactions  the company sometimes experiences out trades or other errors in which the company may have liability for the resulting unmatched position 
the occurrence of out trades generally rises with increases in the volatility of the market 
if an out trade is promptly discovered  thereby allowing prompt disposition of the unmatched position  the risk to the company is usually limited 
if discovery or disposition is delayed  the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening market movements prior to such disposition 
the company believes that the meb system  including its electronic blotter application  because of its ability to identify unbalanced trade conditions as they occur  serves to help limit the market risk exposure when out trades or other errors occur 
to limit its exposure further in such situations  the company s policy is to dispose of any resulting unmatched positions promptly after their discovery 
the company has various foreign exchange rate exposures  including commission income earned in a currency other than the functional currency and foreign income streams which are eventually distributed 
management s strategies to reduce these risks include the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
as a result of the early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  changes in the deemed highly effective portion of the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge commission income earned in a currency other than the functional currency are deferred from recognition into earnings until the forecasted revenue streams are realized 
as of year end and  the company has postponed its hedging practice with respect to anticipated dividends from the tokyo partnership  awaiting a time when it can better predict the income streams therefrom 
if and when foreign currency forward contracts are again used to hedge these anticipated dividends  the gains and losses thereon will be included in current operations even though the offsetting gains and losses on the income streams are not recognized until realized 
the company s note payable to gecc and preferred stock have interest and dividend rates that are fixed 
although the company has theoretical interest rate exposure with these instruments should market interest rates decline or rise  management s judgment is that the aggregate future required payments under these instruments are satisfactory as a business matter  and do not require application of hedging strategies 
in addition  the company s exposure to fixed interest rates has declined during as a result of the maturing of certain notes payable 
the subordinated notes payable to monecor and any borrowings under the facility with gecc bear interest at variable rates 
management will continue to monitor the level of borrowings under the gecc facility as well as the interest rate environment to determine the necessity of a hedging strategy to guard against increases in market interest rates 
the tables below provide information  at each of december  and december   about the company s financial instruments used for other than trading purposes that are sensitive to either changes in interest rates or changes in foreign exchange rates
