the company cautions that although forward looking statements reflect the company s good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under the headings general risks of the company and environmental matters in the company s annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement the company owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which the company conducts all of its operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates regional shopping centers nationally 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers and the taubman company limited partnership the manager 
shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
the operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to the company s ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
in august  the company completed a transaction to acquire an additional interest in one of its unconsolidated joint ventures  the operating partnership became the owner of twelve oaks and the joint venture partner became the owner of lakeside 
performance statistics presented include lakeside through the date of the transaction 
on september   the operating partnership exchanged interests in shopping centers nine consolidated businesses and one unconsolidated joint venture and a share of the operating partnership s debt for all of the partnership units owned by two general motors pension trusts gmpt the gmpt exchange 
performance statistics presented exclude these centers transferred centers 
mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
the company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales 
mall tenant sales in thousands    sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs occupancy historically  average annual occupancy has been within a narrow band 
in the last ten years  average annual occupancy has ranged between and 
mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy and leased space rates are as follows mall tenant average occupancy ending occupancy leased space rental rates as leases have expired in the shopping centers  the company has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years 
average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores closing during year stores opening during year in  average minimum rent per square foot for stores opening during the year was higher because of the leasing of smaller than average spaces at several of the company s most productive centers 
generally  the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in the company s historic range of to per square foot 
this statistic is difficult to predict in part because the company s leasing policies and practices may result in early lease terminations with actual average closing rents per square foot which may vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations 
seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands mall tenant sales      revenues      occupancy average ending leased space because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs results of operations the following represent significant debt  equity  and other transactions which affected the operating results described under comparison of to refer to liquidity and capital resources for discussion of new center openings and other transactions which will affect operating results of future periods

funds from operations a principal factor that the company considers in determining dividends to shareowners is funds from operations ffo  which is defined as income before extraordinary items  real estate depreciation and amortization  and the allocation to the minority interest in the operating partnership  less preferred dividends and distributions 
gains on dispositions of depreciated operating properties are excluded from ffo 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
however  the national association of real estate investment trusts suggests that funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
in october  nareit approved certain clarifications of the definition of ffo  including that non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under generally accepted accounting principles should be reflected in the calculation of ffo 
the clarified definition is effective january  and restatement of all periods presented is recommended 
under the clarified definition  there would have been no change to the amounts reported for reconciliation of net income to funds from operations in millions of dollars income before gain on disposition of center  extraordinary items  and minority and preferred interests depreciation and amortization share of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization non real estate depreciation preferred dividends and distributions minority interest share of depreciation funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company includes gains on peripheral land sales of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

components of other income operating partnership s share in millions of dollars shopping center related revenues land sales lease cancellation revenue interest income dividends the company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and series a preferred shareowners 
dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
on december   the company declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable january  to shareowners of record on december  the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s series a preferred stock  paid december  to shareowners of record on december  common dividends declared totaled per common share in  of which represented return of capital  represented ordinary income  and represented capital gain  compared to dividends declared in of per common share  of which represented return of capital and represented ordinary income 
the tax status of total common dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately ordinary income 
series a preferred dividends declared were per preferred share in and  of which represented ordinary income and represented capital gains in  while the entire dividend represented ordinary income in the tax status of total dividends to be paid on series a preferred stock is estimated to be ordinary income 
these are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in the company s share of anticipated taxable income of the operating partnership due to the actual results of the operating partnership  changes in the number of the company s outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  and changes in the internal revenue code or its application

new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas  as amended and interpreted  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company s derivatives consist primarily of interest rate cap agreements which the company purchases to reduce its exposure to increases in rates on its floating rate debt 
the company expects that the primary impact of its adoption of sfas will be the timing of the recognition in income of the costs of these agreements 
this may cause earnings volatility as the value of these agreements may change from period to period 
in addition  the swap agreement on the dolphin mall construction loan does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas as a result  the company will recognize its share of losses and income related to this agreement in earnings as the value of the agreement changes 
the company expects to recognize an unrealized loss on this agreement of approximately million in the first quarter because of the decline in interest rates since year end 
the company will recognize a loss of approximately million as a transition adjustment to mark its share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of january   the company s transition date 
of this amount  a million loss will be charged to other comprehensive income with the remainder representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
