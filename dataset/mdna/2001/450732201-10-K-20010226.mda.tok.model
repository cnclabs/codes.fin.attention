overview we are a provider of international voice and fax call completion services  and other value added services using the internet 
we were incorporated in august and commenced commercial operations in may we first recorded revenue from the sale of equipment in may  and first recorded revenue from the sale of voice and fax services over our network in january in july  we changed our name from vip calling  inc to ibasis  inc 
in november  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock  which resulted in total net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in march  the company completed its secondary offering and issued  shares of common stock 
the offering resulted in net proceeds of million 
the company also sold million of convertible subordinated notes due in  for net proceeds of approximately million 
was a year of tremendous growth for ibasis as we continued to execute strongly in our core international voice over ip business  producing significant growth in revenue  minutes and overseas lines 
performance highlights for the full year  revenue totaled million  more than triple the company s full year revenue of million 
in the fourth quarter  as we began to benefit from economies of scale and improving network utilization  we produced nearly million in positive gross margin  creating net positive gross margin for the full year 
we believe that the company is now in a position to achieve sustainable positive gross margin for the foreseeable future 
for the full year  minutes totaled million compared to million minutes of use in  a increase 
in  we also saw an increasing percentage of traffic coming to us from the world s largest carriers  known in the industry as tier carriers 
in the fourth quarter  tier traffic accounted for more than of all the voice traffic carried on the ibasis network  compared with less than at the end of the ibasis network footprint significantly expanded during the fourth quarter and the full year 
the company s total overseas lines were  at the end of the fourth quarter of  up from  at the end of the  a year over year increase 
the total number of points of presence pop s in the ibasis network increased from at the end of to at the end of  an increase of more than 
the company continued to increase the percentage of overseas originated traffic it carries  which improves network utilization and generally produces higher margins than us originated traffic 
by the end of  overseas originated calls accounted for of ibasis traffic and more than of total revenue  up from and respectively  at the end of the company achieved significant market share on many of its routes  ending the year carrying traffic equivalent to between of all us outbound voice and fax traffic to fourteen of the countries served by its global network 
the company expanded its network s geographic reach during  more than doubling the number of countries served by its global network  ending the year with more than on net countries  up from on net countries at the end of the company doubled its customer base during the year  ending the year with more than carrier customers  up from approximately at the end of announced customers included four of china s five largest carriers  one of which  china mobile  is the world s largest wireless carrier  concert global clearinghouse  the at t british telecom global joint venture  ntt me  part of japan s national carrier  telstra  australia s national carrier  the communications authority of thailand  protel  the first mexican carrier licensed to provide international voip services  israeli carrier barak  russian carrier sovintel  and european carriers storm telecommunications and ipirion 
the company deployed itrac interactive traffic analysis center  a web based service that provides customers with interactive analysis tools and critical data about their ibasis network activity  including the total minutes of voice and fax traffic  total number of calls  call completion ratios and average call duration 
itrac data is organized for analysis by country of origin and termination 
by analyzing their global voip traffic with itrac  ibasis customers can streamline their network planning processes and optimize their utilization of the ibasis network 
during the fourth quarter of  the company announced initiatives intended to leverage its voip infrastructure to deliver global access to speech enabled business services 
these included a joint marketing and development effort with speechworks international nasdaq spwx  a leader in the telephony based speech technology industry  to provide global access to speech enabled internet services and content for wireline and wireless carriers  enterprises  voice application service providers voice asps and voice portals 
in december  ibasis announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held priceinteractive  a leading speech application service provider asp whose products and services give enterprises and service providers the ability to speech enable business critical  customer facing solutions  such as e commerce  call center  employee self service  product and sales information  customer care and other interactive applications 
priceinteractive s customers include at t  exxonmobil  gannett  h r block  home shopping network  morgan stanley  sabre group  worldcom  sprint  verizon  and western union 
connecting these services to the ibasis network  with its global reach and reduced network costs  will increase the value and scope of the solutions priceinteractive provides to its large enterprise and carrier customers 
by leveraging the ibasis network and its global footprint with these hosted speech enabled services  ibasis also expects to accelerate its revenue generation from enhanced services 
the acquisition of priceinteractive is an important step in ibasis strategy to enhance the capabilities of its global voip infrastructure with new  speech enabled solutions that connect mobile and fixed phone users to web based applications and services 
on january   we announced a relationship with openwave to become a global asp application service provider partner offering enhanced communications services to wireless carriers and other service providers 
these new ibasis vocore services will be based on openwave s unified messaging offering and will provide a comprehensive package of hosted communications services  including email  voicemail  faxmail  mobile phone synchronization  and personal contact management 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
our primary source of revenue is the fees that we receive from customers for completing calls over our network 
this revenue is dependent on the volume of voice and fax traffic carried over the network  which is measured in minutes 
we charge our customers fees per minute of traffic that are dependent on the length and destination of the call and recognize this revenue in the period in which the call is completed 
we also derive a limited amount of revenue from the sale of equipment to our customers 
most of these equipment sales are financed by us by offsetting termination fees otherwise payable to local service providers against the equipment purchase price until the full purchase price has been paid 
our net revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from voice and fax call completion services to million in from million in the increase in voice and fax call completion services net revenue resulted from an increase in the amount of traffic carried over our network to million minutes in from million minutes in net revenue from the sale of equipment increased to million in from  in data communications and telecommunications expenses 
data communications and telecommunications expenses are comprised primarily of termination fees  purchased minutes  equipment expense and other expenses associated with data communications and telecommunications 
termination fees are paid to local service providers to terminate calls received from our network 
this traffic is measured in minutes  and the per minute rates charged for terminating calls are negotiated with the local service provider and included in our contract with our local service provider 
should competition cause a decrease in our prices and  as a result our profit margins  our contracts with our providers provide us with the right to renegotiate the per minute termination fees 
purchased minutes are fees we pay to other telecommunications carriers for completing calls over the public circuit switched network to destinations outside of our network  and as a back up to our network when our proprietary assured quality routing software indicates that either these carriers are needed to maintain the quality of our services or our capacity to a particular destination has been exceeded 
the amount of these fees depends on the volume of voice and fax traffic carried over the public circuit switched network  which is also measured in minutes of traffic 
presently  less than of our traffic is completed using the public switched telephone network as a backup to the ibasis network 
the per minute rate charge for purchased minutes is negotiated with public circuit switched network carriers for each destination served 
the primary direct expenses that we incur in selling our equipment are those incurred to purchase the component parts of our equipment from a variety of vendors 
the equipment expenses vary based on the number of units contracted  assembled and sold in a particular period  and will increase as equipment sales increase 
other data communication and telecommunications expenses include charges for internet access at our internet offices  fees for the fiber optic connections between our internet offices and our customers and or suppliers  facilities charges for overseas internet access and phone lines to the primary telecommunications carriers in particular countries  and charges for the limited number of dedicated international private line circuits we use 
data communications and telecommunications expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase in data communications and telecommunications expense was driven by the increase in traffic described above  as termination fees increased to million in from million in  and purchased minutes increased to million in from million in equipment expenses directly related to equipment sales increased to million in from  in other data communications and telecommunications expenses  including internet access  public circuit switched network access  and international private line charges  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  data communications and telecommunications expenses decreased to in from in we expect data communications and telecommunication expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales as we increase utilization and efficiency of our network and achieve economies of scale 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our international and domestic network  expenses for improving and operating our global network operations center  salaries  and payroll taxes and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our global network operations center and the rest of our network 
also included in this category are research and development expenses that consist primarily of expenses incurred in enhancing  developing  updating and supporting our network and our proprietary software applications 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase in research and development expenses is due principally to the increase in personnel within the group to at the end of from at the end of as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in from in we expect that research and development expense will continue to decrease as a percentage of sales 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses include expenses relating to the salaries  payroll taxes  benefits and commissions that we pay for sales personnel and the expenses associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns  including expenses relating to our outside public relations firm and industry analysts 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributed to an increase in the number of personnel in the selling and marketing departments which increased to at the end of compared to at the end of as a percentage of total revenue  selling and marketing expenses increased to in from in we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will increase in the future as we expand our domestic and international sales force  hire additional marketing personnel and increase expenditures for selling  promotional and marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in these functions to people at the end of from people at the end of  an increase in consulting and professional fees for information technology initiatives  increased use of outsourced billing services and growth in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales as we leverage our current employee base through automation and other efficiency improvement projects 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase resulted from additional purchases of capital equipment and software that were needed to support our expanding network 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expense increased to in from in we expect depreciation and amortization expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales as we ramp revenues and utilization of the ibasis network 
interest income and interest expense 
interest expense is primarily comprised of interest paid on the convertible subordinated notes and various capital lease agreements established to finance a substantial majority of the hardware and software components of our network 
interest income is primarily composed of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  which increased by million from million at december  to million at december  as a result of our secondary offering of common stock completed in march and the sale of convertible subordinated notes also completed in march interest expense increased to million in from  in this increase was attributable to interest paid on convertible subordinated notes as well as interest paid on capital equipment financing

interest expense is primarily comprised of interest paid on the various capital lease agreements established to finance a substantial majority of the hardware and software components of our network 
interest income is primarily composed of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income increased by million to million in from  in this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents  which increased by million from million as a result of our initial public offering  which was completed in november interest expense increased by  to  in from  in this increase was attributable to interest paid on capital equipment financing 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital and liquidity needs historically have related to the development of our network infrastructure  our sales and marketing activities  research and development expenses  and general capital needs 
our capital needs have been met  in large part  from the net proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings of common stock  the sale of convertible subordinated notes and the sale of our class b common stock and preferred stock 
as we placed greater emphasis on expanding our network infrastructure  we have also sought to meet our capital needs through vendor capital leases and other equipment financings 
we have also established a line of credit with a bank 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these amounts are primarily attributable to the net proceeds from our initial public offering  our secondary public offering  the issuance of convertible notes and the issuance of class b common stock and preferred stock 
the proceeds from the offerings were partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities for all periods resulted from net losses and increases in accounts receivable  which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was primarily related to purchases of equipment  purchases of marketable and non marketable securities 
initial public offering 
in november  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock  which resulted in total net proceeds to us of million 
upon the completion of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of our preferred stock and class b common stock automatically converted into the following number of shares of class a common stock number of shares of class a common stock series a preferred stock  series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock  class b common stock  subsequently  all outstanding shares of class a common stock converted into  shares of common stock 
secondary public offering 
in march  we completed our secondary public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  which resulted in total net proceeds to us of million 
concurrently  we offered million in convertible subordinated notes due which resulted in total net proceeds to us of million 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
equipment leasing and financing 
we lease equipment from various vendors under master agreements and multiple lease sub agreements 
each of the multiple equipment leases specifies its own term  rate and payment schedule  depending upon the value and amount of equipment leased 
as of december   we had an additional million available for borrowing under a million master agreement with cisco systems capital corporation 
revolving line of credit 
on june   the company entered into a loan and security agreement the agreement with a bank which provides for a revolving line of credit the revolver and an equipment line of credit the equipment line 
the revolver  which allowed the company to borrow up to  was renewed for one year in june with a maximum borrowing amount of  borrowings under the revolver  collateralized by substantially all assets of the company  are payable at maturity and bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  plus per annum 
the agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants including a minimum quick ratio  tangible net worth and liquidity  as defined 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends 
at december   there were no borrowings under the revolver 
however  the company had posted  of letters of credit against the revolver 
the company borrowed  under the equipment line during for purposes of equipment purchases 
borrowings under the equipment line bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  plus and are payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest through august at december   there was no availability under the equipment line 
the amounts under this facility have been included in long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  and risk factors any investment in our shares of common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  which we believe are all the material risks to our business  including the business of priceinteractive  inc 
of reston  virginia  with whom we entered into a merger agreement on december   together with the information contained elsewhere in this report  before you make a decision to invest in our company 
risks related to our operations we have a limited operating history upon which to base your investment decision  and you may inaccurately assess our prospects for success 
we were incorporated in august and first began to offer commercial services in may due to our limited operating history  it is difficult for us to predict future results of operations both for our core business and our enhanced service offerings 
moreover  we cannot be sure that we have accurately identified all of the risks to our business  especially because we use new  and in many cases  unproven technologies and provide new services  the technical implementation of which on a commercial scale  and widespread commercial acceptance of  is yet unproven 
as a result  our past results and rates of growth may not be meaningful indicators of our future results of operations 
also  your assessment of the prospects for our success may prove inaccurate 
we have a history of operating losses and may never become profitable 
during  we incurred a net loss of million 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows as we incur significant operating expenses and make capital investments in our business 
our future profitability will depend on our being able to deliver calls over our network at a cost to us that is less than what we are able to charge for our calls  and utilize our network to deliver new  enhanced services on a profitable basis 
our costs to deliver calls are dependent on a number of factors  including the countries to which we direct calls and whether we are able to use the internet  rather than another component of our network or more expensive back up networks  to deliver calls 
the prices that we are able to charge to deliver calls over our network vary  based primarily on the prices currently prevailing in the international long distance carrier market to specific countries 
while we are currently able to terminate a substantial number of the calls carried over our network profitably on an operating basis  we have been unable to operate our entire network profitably on an operating basis for sustained periods of time 
our ability to deliver new capabilities like unified communications and our global spoken web also depends on a variety of factors 
unified communications  for which we use the brand name vocore  allows our customers to offer end users voicemail  email  and faxes accessible from a variety of devices  including telephones and personal computers 
the global spoken web initiative is intended to bring together a network of speech sites  making web content and other applications such as customer relationship management accessible through speech recognition technology over the telephone 
we have not yet recognized revenues from vocore or our global spoken web initiative and priceinteractive s speechport service  described in business company overview  offering to be acquired in the merger has achieved only relatively small amounts of revenue to date 
it may take longer than we expect to gain acceptance in the market for these services 
in addition  we may be unable to make effective use of the technology we employ  scale the service for wide use  or leverage our network infrastructure adequately to take advantage of possible economies of scale 
we may not ever generate sufficient revenues  or reduce costs to the extent necessary  to permit us to achieve profitability 
even if we do become profitable  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations that result from various factors inherent in our business may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
our revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not in our control  including  among others the amount of traffic we are able to sell to our customers  and their decisions on whether to route traffic over our network  our ability to generate revenues from the delivery of new value added capabilities like vocore and our global spoken web initiative and priceinteractive s speechport offering that are appealing to the market  pricing pressure in the international long distance market  the percentage of traffic that we are able to carry over the internet  or over our dedicated international private circuit lines  rather than over the more costly traditional public switched telephone network  loss of arbitrage opportunities resulting from declines in international settlement rates or tariffs  our ability to negotiate lower termination fees charged by our local providers if our pricing deteriorates  our continuing ability to negotiate competitive costs to interconnect our network with those of other carriers  capital expenditures required to expand or upgrade our network  changes in call volume among the countries to which we complete calls  the portion of our total traffic that we carry over more attractive routes could fall  independent of route specific price  cost or volume changes  technical difficulties or failures of our network systems or third party delays in expansion or provisioning system problems  and currency fluctuations in countries where we operate 
because of these factors  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in future periods  our results of operations will be significantly lower than the estimates of public market analysts and investors 
such a discrepancy could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
we may never generate sufficient revenue to attain profitability if telecommunications carriers and other communications service providers are reluctant to use our services or do not use our services  including any new services  in sufficient volume 
if the market for internet telephony and other new services does not develop as we expect  or develops more slowly than expected  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our customers may be reluctant to use our internet telephony services for a number of reasons  including perceptions that the quality of voice transmitted over the internet is low  perceptions that internet telephony is unreliable  our inability to deliver traffic over the internet with significant cost advantages  and development of their own capacity on routes served by us 
our potential customers for our new services  including the service offerings acquired from priceinteractive  may be reluctant to use these services as a result of perceptions that our enhanced services are unnecessary  too expensive  ineffective  or not appealing to their end user customers or client base 
the growth of our core business depends on carriers and other communications service providers generating an increased volume of international voice and fax traffic and selecting our network to carry at least some of this traffic 
if the volume of international voice and fax traffic fails to increase  or decreases  and these third parties do not employ our network  our ability to become profitable will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we cannot assure investors that communications service providers and their end user customers and others will be receptive to  and subscribe to  unified communications services  or any other enhanced services that we elect to deploy on our network 
any perceived problems with the reliability or functionality of any new services that we offer could discourage communications service providers or others from offering these services to their customers 
in addition  the development of new capabilities  such as vocore and global spoken web  may require substantial additional capital expenditures to be made well in advance of generating any revenue from such services or demonstrating any market acceptance of such services 
if carriers  communications service providers do not employ our network to offer any new services to their customers  or if their customers do not subscribe for the services when offered  our results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that end users will continue to purchase services from our customers or that our customers will maintain a demand for our services 
we may not be able to successfully integrate priceinteractive and achieve the benefits expected to result from the merger 
on december   we entered into a merger agreement with priceinteractive  inc pursuant to which priceinteractive  inc 
will be merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of ibasis 
we entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in mutual benefits including  among other things  benefits relating to expanded and complementary product offerings  enhanced revenues  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of engineering personnel 
achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the integration of our technology  operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the merger will result in the loss of market opportunity or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management 
among the challenges involved in this integration are demonstrating to our customers that the merger will not result in adverse changes in service standards or business focus and persuading our personnel that our business cultures are compatible 
in addition  priceinteractive s principal offices are located in reston  virginia  and our principal offices are located in burlington  massachusetts 
we intend to keep most of the operations of priceinteractive in reston 
we must successfully integrate priceinteractive s operations and personnel with our operations and personnel for the merger to be successful 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate or profitably manage priceinteractive s businesses 
in addition  we cannot assure you that  following the transaction  our businesses will achieve revenues specific net income or loss levels  efficiencies or synergies that justify the merger or that the merger will result in increased earnings for the combined company in any future period 
further  the combined company may experience slower rates of growth as compared to historical rates of growth of them independently 
if we do not integrate priceinteractive s technologies and operations quickly and effectively  some or all of the potential benefits of the merger may not occur 
we must make priceinteractive s technology  products and services operate together with our technologies  products and services 
if we do not integrate their operations and technologies quickly and smoothly  serious harm to the combined company s business  financial condition and prospects may result 
integrating the two businesses will entail significant diversion of management s time and attention 
we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on developing their business and services or other matters 
in addition  the integration may require the partial or wholesale conversion or redesign of some or all of the technologies  products and services of either ibasis or priceinteractive 
the loss of key priceinteractive personnel could make it difficult to complete existing projects and undertake new projects 
the success of the combined company will depend on its ability to identify  hire and retain employees  and a significant component of the value of the merger is in the know how and experience of priceinteractive employees that we expect to employ 
if key priceinteractive employees were to leave after the merger  we may be unable to complete existing priceinteractive projects or to undertake new projects  each of which could materially impair our future earnings and results of operations 
we do not have employment agreements that provide for a fixed term of employment with most of the key employees of priceinteractive 
we expect to incur substantial transaction  consolidation and integration costs related to the merger 
whether or not the merger with priceinteractive is consummated  we will have incurred substantial expenses 
we estimate that  if the merger is consummated  the combined company will incur transaction costs of approximately million including investment banking  legal  accounting and printing fees 
we expect that we will also incur significant consolidation and integration expenses that we cannot accurately estimate at this time 
we expect that the combined company will charge the majority of these consolidation and integration costs and expenses to operations in fiscal the amount of the transaction costs is a preliminary estimate and is subject to change 
actual transaction costs may substantially exceed our estimates and  when combined with the expenses incurred in connection with the consolidation and integration of our companies  could have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition and operating results of the combined company 
the accounting treatment of the merger will result in significant charges to our operations 
we intend to account for the merger with priceinteractive as a purchase for financial reporting and accounting purposes  under united states generally accepted accounting principles  with us acquiring priceinteractive 
after completion of the merger  the results of operations of priceinteractive will be included in the consolidated financial statements of ibasis from the date of the merger 
the purchase price will be allocated to priceinteractive s assets and liabilities based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
any excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets of priceinteractive and identifiable intangible assets acquired will be classified as goodwill and other intangible assets  including in process research and development 
goodwill and other intangibles will be amortized by charges to operations over their estimated useful lives of three to four years and in process research and development will be charged to operations at the time of closing in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
we will also record stock based compensation relating to the issuance of options to priceinteractive employees 
the amount of charges for stock based compensation  in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles will be significant and will therefore have a material negative impact on the combined company s future operating results which could cause our stock price to decline 
we may face quality and capacity problems over our network upon failures by third parties 
vendors 
we rely upon third party vendors to provide us with the equipment and software that we use to transfer and translate calls from traditional voice networks to the internet  and vice versa 
for example  we purchase substantially all of our internet telephony equipment from cisco systems 
priceinteractive relies upon third party venders to provide its business with speech recognition technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue purchasing such equipment and software from our vendors  and  following the merger  priceinteractive s vendors  on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we become unable to purchase from such vendors the software and equipment needed to maintain and expand our network as currently configured and to provide services currently provided by priceinteractive  we may not be able to maintain or expand our network to accommodate growth or provide the services currently provided by priceinteractive and we may consequently be unable to increase revenues sufficiently to become profitable 
see also strategic relationships  below 
parties that maintain phone and data lines 
our business model depends on the availability of the internet and traditional telephone networks to transmit voice and fax calls  and to provide other enhanced services 
third parties maintain and  in many cases  own these networks and other components that comprise the internet 
some of these third parties are national telephone companies 
they may increase their charges for using these lines at any time and decrease our profitability 
they may also fail to maintain their lines properly and disrupt our ability to provide service to our customers 
any failure by these third parties to maintain these lines and networks that leads to a material disruption of our ability to complete calls or provide other services could discourage our customers from using our network or enhanced services  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing our ability to become profitable 
local communications service providers 
we maintain relationships with local communications service providers in many countries  some of whom own the equipment that translates voice to data in that country 
we rely upon these third parties both to provide lines over which we complete calls and to increase their capacity when necessary as the volume of our traffic increases 
there is a risk that these third parties may be slow  or fail  to provide lines  which would affect our ability to complete calls to those destinations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue our relationships with these local service providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
because we rely upon entering into relationships with local service providers to expand into additional countries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase the number of countries to which we provide service 
we also may not be able to enter into relationships with enough overseas local service providers to handle increases in the volume of calls that we receive from our customers 
finally  any technical difficulties that these providers suffer would affect our ability to transmit calls to the countries that those providers help serve 
strategic relationships 
we depend in part on our strategic relationships to expand our distribution channels and develop and market our services 
in particular  we depend in large part on our joint marketing and product development efforts with cisco systems to achieve market acceptance and brand recognition in certain markets 
our vocore product relies on technology and services from companies such as openwave formerly software 
com  emc and hewlett packard 
strategic relationship partners may choose not to renew existing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  priceinteractive also depends in part on its strategic relationships with speechworks international  inc and microstrategy 
in general  if we lose these key strategic relationships  or if we fail to maintain or develop new relationships in the future  our ability to expand the scope and capacity of our network and services provided  and to maintain state of the art technology  would be materially adversely affected 
our global spoken web initiative will also rely on key strategic relationships  which will be subject to the same considerations 
the market demand for vocore as well as voice sites and services associated with our global spoken web initiative and speech recognition technology generally may not develop as anticipated  which would substantially impede our ability to generate revenues 
our future financial performance depends in part on growth in demand for vocore and new services such as voice application and speech recognition services and products 
if the market for these services and products does not develop or if we are unable to capture a significant portion of that market  either directly or through our partners  our revenues and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
the markets for unified communications and voice application services and products is  including priceinteractive s products and services  relatively new and evolving 
the adoption of such services and products could be hindered by the perceived cost  quality and reliability of these new technologies  as well as the reluctance among businesses that have invested substantially in legacy equipment that provide traditional email  voicemail and or touch tone based  interactive voice response and other systems 
the continued development of the market for our enhanced services and products will depend upon the widespread adoption of voice driven applications by businesses for use in conducting transactions and managing relationships with their customers  widespread adoption of solutions to unify a variety of communications modes through one solution  consumer acceptance of such applications  and continuing improvements in hardware and software technology that may reduce the cost and improve the performance of voice solutions 
the market for speech activated services is new and potential industry standards  such as voicexml  have not yet matured 
if multiple standards are adopted  we may need to support them  which would require additional time and resources  and could negatively impact revenue and margins 
even if the demand for vocore and new voice application services and products does grow  if we fail to meet subscriber expectations  the market ability of the vocore offering and any other product could be materially reduced 
the quality of speech applications over an ip network has not yet been fully proven and failures by voice site providers to adopt these applications may have a material negative impact on our future results of operations 
speech applications  such as our global spoken web and priceinteractive s speechport  have not been extensively tested on ip infrastructures 
if performance and accuracy of speech services are negatively affected by a particular ip infrastructure  the commercial acceptance of these applications by voice site providers on that infrastructure will be low 
failure by voice site providers to adopt these applications may have a material negative impact on our results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline 
as an international company  ibasis is dependent upon the further development of text to speech and speech recognition applications in multiple languages 
our customers may require a longer sales and implementation cycle  which could negatively affect our revenue plans 
if actual sales and development cycles for our enhanced offerings or offerings of priceinteractive acquired in the merger are substantially longer than anticipated  revenue targets would not be met 
the failure or lack of effective third party technologies and services could limit our ability to generate revenues 
some of our intended enhanced services offerings and the service offerings acquired in the merger from priceinteractive are dependent on technology developed by third parties 
these technologies include email servers that process both email messages and voicemail messages  software that converts text to speech  speech recognition software  billing system software  and network operations center servers  routers and other equipment 
we will continue to incorporate third party technologies in future unified communications and speech application services and products 
we have limited control over whether or when these third party technologies will be enhanced 
in addition  our competitors may acquire interests in these third parties or their technologies  which may render the technology unavailable to us 
if a third party fails or refuses to timely develop  license or support technology necessary to our services or products  market acceptance of our services or products could be adversely affected 
moreover  if these third party technologies fail or otherwise prove to be not viable  it may have a significant impact on our ability to provide our services and or to generate revenues 
in addition  we rely and will continue to rely on services supplied by third parties such as telecommunications  internet access and electrical power for services hosted in our network operations center 
if these third party services fail to meet industry standards for quality and reliability  market acceptance of our services could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to succeed in the intensely competitive market for our various services 
the market for internet voice  fax and other enhanced services is extremely competitive and will likely become more competitive 
internet protocol and internet telephony service providers  such as gric communications and itxc corp  route traffic to destinations worldwide and compete directly with us 
also  internet telephony service providers  such as netphone  that presently focus on retail customers  may in the future enter our market and compete with us 
such retail oriented carriers also provide pc to pc services at very low prices or for free 
perceived competition with this market segment could drive our prices down 
in addition  major telecommunications carriers  such as at t  deutsche telekom  mci worldcom and qwest communications  have all entered or announced plans to enter the internet telephony market 
in particular  at t invested over billion in netphone in april 
we also face competition from other companies who offer unified communications and speech recognition applications 
we directly compete at the wholesale level with a number of other unified communications providers such as deltathree 
com  orchestrate  tornado development  and ureach 
some of the competition eg deltathree 
com and tornado development sell unified communications directly to end users in addition to selling at the wholesale level 
furthermore  voice portal companies such as tellme and bevocal may in the future develop business models that compete directly with our global spoken web business 
many of these companies are larger than we are and have substantially greater managerial and financial resources than we do 
intense competition in our markets can be expected to continue to impose downward pressure on prices and adversely affect our profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors and we may lose customers or fail to grow our business as a result of this competition 
we are subject to downward pricing pressures on our wholesale international internet telephony services and a continuing need to renegotiate overseas rates which could delay or prevent our profitability 
as a result of numerous factors  including increased competition and global deregulation of telecommunications services  prices for international long distance calls have been decreasing 
this downward trend of prices to end users has caused us to lower the prices we charge communications service providers for call completion on our network 
if this downward pricing pressure continues  we cannot assure you that we will be able to offer internet telephony services at costs lower than  or competitive with  the traditional voice network services with which we compete 
moreover  in order for us to lower our prices  we have to renegotiate rates with our overseas local service providers who complete calls for us 
we may not be able to renegotiate these terms favorably enough  or fast enough  to allow us to continue to offer services in a particular country on a cost effective basis 
the continued downward pressure on prices and our failure to renegotiate favorable terms in a particular country would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our network and internet telephony business profitably 
we may face pricing pressures from free retail unified communication unified messaging offerings 
some unified communication or unified messaging services providers have a free retail offering 
in particular  onebox  a service of openwave  offers services similar to vocore with limited functionality for no charge 
free retail unified communications could become a prevalent model putting significant pricing pressure on fee based offerings at the wholesale level 
this could have an adverse affect on ibasis ability to generate revenue and margins on vocore services 
a variety of risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business 
because we provide many of our services internationally  we are subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries 
in particular  in order to provide services and operate facilities in some countries  we have established subsidiaries or other legal entities 
associated risks include unexpected changes in tariffs  trade barriers and regulatory requirements relating to internet access or internet telephony  or enhanced services  economic weakness  including inflation  or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  compliance with tax  employment immigration and labor laws for employees living and traveling abroad  foreign taxes including withholding of payroll taxes  and foreign currency fluctuations  which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues  and other obligations incident to doing business or operating a subsidiary in another country 
in addition  we are subject to a variety of risks associated with the provision of unified communications and international voice site business management  any of which could negatively affect our business 
these risks include providing easy telephone access to the ibasis network and relying on third party vendors to create and refine different language models for each particular language or dialect 
these language models are required to create versions of our products that allow end users to speak the local language or dialect and be understood and authenticated 
if vendors fail to develop localized versions of our products  our ability to address international market opportunities and to grow our business will be limited 
these and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations 
a significant portion of our revenue was generated by delivering calls to asian middle eastern and latin american countries 
many countries in these geographic regions have experienced political and economic instability over the past decade 
repeated political or economic instability in countries to which we deliver substantial volumes of traffic could lead to difficulties in completing calls through our regional service providers or decreased call volume to such countries 
if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological change in a cost effective way  the relative quality of our services could suffer 
the technology upon which our services  and the services acquired from priceinteractive in the merger  depend is changing rapidly 
significant technological changes could render the hardware and software which we use obsolete  and competitors may begin to offer new services that we are unable to offer 
we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness  reliability  services and features of our network and by developing new features and applications to meet customer needs 
if we are unable to respond successfully to these developments or do not respond in a cost effective way  we may not be able to offer competitive services 
we may not be able to expand and upgrade our network adequately and cost effectively to accommodate any future growth 
our internet telephony business requires that we handle a large number of international calls simultaneously 
as we expand our operations  we expect to handle significantly more calls 
we will need to expand and upgrade our hardware and software to accommodate such increased traffic 
if we do not expand and upgrade quickly enough  we will not have sufficient capacity to handle the traffic and growth in our operating performance would suffer 
even with such expansion  we may be unable to manage new deployments or utilize them in a cost effective manner 
in addition to lost growth opportunities  any such failure could adversely affect customer confidence in the ibasis network and could result in us losing business outright 
if we fail to manage our growth  we could lose customers 
we have grown rapidly to date and expect to continue to grow rapidly 
in order to increase the number of our customers and the size of our operations  we will need to improve our administrative  accounting  operating systems and controls  as well as integrate those of priceinteractive following the merger 
we may need to redesign several internal systems 
our attention to these matters may distract us from other aspects of our business 
moreover  failure to implement new systems and controls  or to integrate those of priceinteractive  may hamper our ability to provide services to customers and may impair the quality of our services which could result in the loss of customers 
our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers 
we generate much of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
customers may discontinue their use of our services at any time  and without notice 
therefore  in any given quarter  we would lose a significant amount of revenue if we lost one or more of our major customers 
we depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining the skilled employees we need to execute our growth plans 
we depend heavily on our key management 
our future success will depend  in large part  on the continued service of our key management and technical personnel  including ofer gneezy  our president and chief executive officer  gordon vanderbrug  our executive vice president  michael hughes  our chief financial officer  and charles giambalvo  our senior vice president of worldwide sales 
if any of these individuals or others at the company are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
we do not carry key person life insurance on our personnel 
while each of the individuals named above has entered into an employment agreement with us  these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us 
we will need to attract skilled personnel to execute our growth plans 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly engineering and technical personnel 
competition for such employees in our industry is intense 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
we may not be able to retain our employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
if we do not succeed in attracting and retaining skilled personnel  we may not be able to grow at a sufficient rate to attain profitable operations 
a failure to obtain necessary additional capital in the future on acceptable terms could prevent us from executing our business plan 
we may need additional capital in the future to fund our operations  finance investments in equipment and corporate infrastructure  expand our network  increase the range of services we offer and respond to competitive pressures and perceived opportunities 
cash flow from operations  and cash on hand may not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and capital investment needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a failure to obtain additional funding could prevent us from making expenditures that are needed to allow us to grow or maintain our operations 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity securities  the relative equity ownership of our existing investors could be diluted or the new investors could obtain terms more favorable than previous investors 
if we raise additional funds through debt financing  we could incur significant borrowing costs 
the failure to obtain additional financing when required could result in us being unable to grow as required to attain profitable operations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position would be adversely affected 
we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property 
unauthorized third parties may copy our services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
end user license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of any licensed program may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
while we do not have any patents pending  following the acquisition of priceinteractive  we will own rights to certain patents  patent applications  and other additional intellectual property 
in addition  we may seek to patent certain software or equipment in the future 
we do not know if any of our future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
we believe that we do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third party  and no third party has asserted a material patent infringement claim against us 
it is possible  however  that such a claim might be asserted successfully against us in the future 
our ability to provide our services depends on our freedom to operate 
that is  we must ensure that we do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others or have licensed all such rights 
neither we nor priceinteractive have requested or obtained an opinion from counsel as to whether our services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties 
a party making an infringement claim could secure a substantial monetary award or obtain injunctive relief that could effectively block our ability to provide services in the united states or abroad 
we and priceinteractive have received letters and other notices claiming that certain of our and priceinteractive s products and services may infringe patents or other intellectual property of other parties 
to date  none of these has resulted in a material restriction on any use of our intellectual property or has had a material adverse impact on our business 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may  or may be claimed  to cover our technology or that of priceinteractive 
current or future claims could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements to the extent necessary for the conduct of our business 
however  we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction against use of our proprietary or licenses systems 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could materially adversely affect our business and profitability 
we and priceinteractive rely on a variety of technology  primarily software  that is licensed from third parties 
continued use of this technology by us or priceinteractive require that we purchase new or additional licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurances that we can obtain those third party licenses needed for our business or that the third party technology licenses that we do have will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss or inability to maintain or obtain upgrades to any of these technology licenses could result in delays or breakdowns in our ability to continue developing and providing our services or to enhance and upgrade our services 
we may undertake additional strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
we may acquire additional businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  services and technologies 
integrating any newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses  which may result in dilution for stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness 
we may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully 
risks related to the internet and internet telephony industry if the internet does not continue to grow as a medium for voice and fax communications and other enhanced services  our business will suffer 
the technology that allows voice and fax communications over the internet  and the delivery of other enhanced services and capabilities like vocore  the global spoken web initiative and priceinteractive s services  are still in the early stages of development 
historically  the sound quality of calls placed over the internet was poor 
as the internet telephony industry has grown  sound quality has improved  but the technology requires further refinement 
additionally  as a result of the internet s capacity constraints  callers could experience delays  errors in transmissions or other interruptions in service 
transmitting telephone calls over the internet  and other uses of the internet for our enhanced services  must also be accepted by customers as an alternative to traditional services 
because the internet telephony market and markets for our enhanced services are new and evolving  predicting the size of these markets and their growth rate is difficult 
if our market fails to develop  then we will be unable to grow our customer base and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
if the internet infrastructure is not adequately maintained  we may be unable to maintain the quality of our services and provide them in a timely and consistent manner 
our future success will depend upon the maintenance of the internet infrastructure  including a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security for providing reliability and timely internet access and services 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or bandwith requirements  the internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it and its performance or reliability may decline thereby impairing our ability to complete calls and provide other services using the internet at consistently high quality 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of failures of portions of its infrastructure or otherwise 
any future outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to complete calls and provide other services 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  cost  ease of use and access  intellectual property ownership and other legal liability issues  remain unresolved and could materially and adversely affect both the growth of internet usage generally and our business in particular 
finally  important opportunities to grow traffic on the ibasis network will not be realized if the underlying infrastructure of the internet does not continue to be expanded to more locations worldwide 
we cannot be certain that our ability to provide our services using the internet will not be adversely affected by computer vandalism 
if the overall performance of the internet is seriously downgraded by website attacks or other acts of computer vandalism or virus infection  our ability to deliver our communication services over the internet could be adversely impacted  which could cause us to have to increase the amount of traffic we have to carry over alternative networks  including the more costly public switched telephone network 
in addition  traditional business interruption insurance may not cover losses we could incur because of any such disruption of the internet 
while some insurers are beginning to offer products purporting to cover these losses  we do not have any of this insurance at this time 
risks related to our company international governmental regulation and legal uncertainties could limit our ability to provide our services or make them more expensive 
the regulatory treatment of internet telephony and our enhanced services offerings outside of the united states varies widely by country 
as discussed more fully in the section entitled government regulation  a number of countries currently prohibit or limit competition in the provision of traditional voice telephony services 
in some of those countries  licensed telephony carriers as well as foreign regulators have questioned our legal authority and or the legal authority of our partners to offer our services 
we may face similar questions in additional countries 
if we are forced to suspend or discontinue certain operations as a result of foreign regulatory or legal challenges  this could substantially affect our ability to achieve profitability 
some countries prohibit  limit or regulate how companies provide internet telephony 
some countries have indicated they will evaluate proposed internet telephony service on a case by case basis and determine whether to regulate it as a voice service or as another telecommunications service  and in doing so potentially impose subsidies or other costs on internet telephony providers 
in addition  many countries have not yet addressed internet telephony in their legislation or regulations 
increased regulation of the internet and or internet telephony providers  or the prohibition of internet telephony or related services  including our enhanced offerings  in one or more countries  could limit our ability to provide our services or make them more expensive 
finally  international organizations such as the international telecomunications union and the european commission are continuing to examine whether internet telephony should continue to be subject to light regulation 
adverse recommendations by these bodies could also limit our ability to provide services profitably 
in addition  as we make our services available in foreign countries  and as we work to enable sales by our customers to end users in foreign countries  such countries may claim that we are required to qualify to do business in that particular country  that we are otherwise subject to regulation  including requirements to obtain authorization  or that we are prohibited in all cases from conducting our business in that foreign country 
we currently have subsidiaries in argentina  australia  brazil  hong kong  japan  mexico  peru  the united kingdom and singapore  and a branch in the united arab emirates 
we are authorized to provide services in belgium  canada  france  germany  italy  netherlands  peru  singapore  spain  switzerland  and the united kingdom  and the united states 
our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction in which we are required to do so or to comply with foreign laws and regulations could seriously restrict our ability to provide services in such jurisdiction  or limit our ability to enforce contacts in that jurisdiction 
our customers also currently are  or in the future may become  subject to these same requirements 
we cannot assure you that our customers are currently in compliance with any such requirements or that they will be able to continue to comply with any such requirements 
the failure of our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations could prevent us from being able to conduct business with them  and would result in a loss of revenue for us 
additionally  it is possible that countries may apply laws to transport services provided over the internet  including laws governing sales and other taxes  including payroll withholding applications  user privacy  pricing controls  characteristics and quality of products and services  consumer protection  cross border commerce  including laws that would impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions  copyright  trademark and patent infringement  and claims based on the nature and content of internet materials  including defamation  negligence and the failure to meet necessary obligations 
if foreign governments or other bodies begin to regulate or prohibit internet telephony or our other services  this regulation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
the telecommunications industry is subject to domestic governmental regulation and legal uncertainties that could prevent us from executing our business plan 
while the federal communications commission has tentatively decided that information service providers  including internet telephony providers  are not telecommunications carriers for regulatory purposes  various companies have challenged that decision 
some congressional elements are dissatisfied with the conclusions of the fcc and the fcc could impose greater or lesser regulation on our industry 
such regulation could mean imposition of surcharges related to such things as access or universal service 
we cannot assure you that state government agencies will not increasingly regulate internet related services 
increased regulation of the internet may slow its growth 
this regulation may also negatively impact the cost of doing business over the internet and materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
we are not licensed to offer traditional telecommunications services in any us state and we have not filed tariffs for any service at the federal communications commission or at any state regulatory commission 
nonetheless  as more fully discussed in the section of this prospectus entitled government regulation  aspects of our operations may currently be  or become  subject to state or federal regulations governing licensing  universal service funding  disclosure of confidential communications or other information  excise taxes  transactions restricted by us embargo and other reporting or compliance requirements 
this regulation may also negatively impact the cost of doing business and materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
the market price of our shares may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations for reasons over which we have little control 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  extreme price and volume fluctuations 
prices of securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
the market price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated greatly since our initial public offering and could continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
provisions of our governing documents and delaware law could discourage acquisition proposals or delay a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain anti takeover provisions  including those listed below  that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if that change in control would be beneficial to stockholders our board of directors has the authority to issue common stock and preferred stock  and to determine the price  rights and preferences of any new series of preferred stock  without stockholder approval  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each serving three year terms  our stockholders need a supermajority of votes to amend key provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  there are limitations on who can call special meetings of stockholders  our stockholders may not take action by written consent  and our stockholders must provide specified advance notice to nominate directors or submit stockholder proposals 
in addition  provisions of delaware law and our stock option plan may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  we have not engaged in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments that would be likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps of forward or futures contracts 
our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on borrowings under our credit lines  which are subject to interest rates based on the banks prime rate  and a change in the applicable interest rate would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds or finance equipment purchases 
while to date our global operations have generated revenues in united states dollars  we are currently evaluating the impact of foreign currency exchange risk on our results of operations as we continue to expand globally
