item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the original statistical package for the social sciences was introduced in  and spss was incorporated in the first spss products were almost exclusively used by academic researchers working on mainframe computing systems 
spss subsequently transformed and enhanced its core product technology  broadened its customer base into the corporate and government sectors  significantly expanded its sales and marketing capabilities  acquired twelve corporate entities and product offerings  and adapted its products to changing hardware and software technologies 
approximately of revenues came from sales to customers in corporate settings  with another in academic institutions and in government agencies 
in recent years spss has experienced a significant shift in the sources of its revenues 
between and  revenues from its analytical solutions increased from to over of total net revenues and market research revenues rose from to 
in contrast  revenue from spss statistical products and services declined from to of net revenues 
management expects these trends to continue in results of operations the following table shows select statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the years indicated 
year ended december  net revenues analytical solutions market research statistics net revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing product development general and administrative special general and administrative charges merger related acquired in process technology operating expenses operating income net interest income expense other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of the years ended december   and net revenues 
net revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of from  and decreased to  in  a decrease of from the increase was primarily due to growth in analytical solutions revenues of  primarily due to additional new data mining products and sales of the newly acquired clementine products  as well as increases in market research revenues of  primarily due to the introduction of a new web data collection product  revenues from the newly acquired surveycraft products and an increased number of large transactions with major customers 
offsetting this revenue growth was an increase in statistics revenue of only in  primarily due to shifts in sales and marketing resources toward developing the higher growth markets for analytical solutions  as well as reflecting the lower overall growth rate in the market for general purpose statistical products 
the decrease was due primarily to the negative effects of deferring revenues in accordance with aicpa technical practice aids regarding software revenue recognition 
this application resulted in a  reduction in net revenues 
growth in analytical solutions revenues increased due to increases in data mining products and sales 
market research revenues declined in primarily due to the negative effects of the deferred revenues adjustment previously mentioned 
statistics revenue decreased in due to the deferred revenue adjustment and a lower overall growth rate in the market for general purpose statistical products 
revenues were adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates for the three years described 
during  the aicpa staff released several technical practice aids tpa for the software industry  consisting of questions and answers related to the financial accounting and reporting issues of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
as a result of the issuance of these tpa s  spss performed a comprehensive review of their revenue recognition policies to ensure compliance with recent authoritative literature 
on a prospective basis from the fourth quarter of  spss applied the standards set forth in tpa fair value of pcs in a short term time based license and software revenue recognition and tpa fair value of pcs in perpetual and multi year time based licenses and software revenue recognition 
as a result of the application of the tpa s  spss began to recognize the revenue from short term time based licenses and perpetual licenses with multi year maintenance terms ratable over the term of the contract 
spss recorded a one time adjustment of approximately  to defer revenue for contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of costs of goods sold  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and royalties paid to third parties 
cost of revenues increased from  in to  in  and decreased to  in these costs increased in due to higher sales levels and higher amounts of capitalized software amortized 
cost of revenues decreased in due to a decrease in shipping costs and royalties paid to third party software providers 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues increased from in  to in and sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from  in to  in and to  in  an increase of in and in these increases reflect the company s strategy of expanding sales management  recruiting additional  more senior sales representatives  and hiring more professional services personnel 
sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in and as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in  and increased to in product development 
product development expenses increased from  in to  in and to  in net of the effect of capitalized software development costs of  in   in and  in an increase of in and an increase of in in the same periods  the company s expense for amortization of capitalized software and product translations  included in cost of revenues  was  in   in and  in the increases in product development expenses were primarily due to staff increases  salary increases and recruiting fees 
as a percentage of net revenues  product development expenses increased from in to in and to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in and decreased to  in  an increase of in and a decrease of in the increase in was due to additional administrative staff  primarily information systems personnel 
the decrease in was due to reduced costs by consolidating the united states accounting functions and lower bad debt expense 
this expense decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in and in special general and administrative charges 
special general and administrative charges were  in and represented the write off of duplicate capitalized software development costs of platforms such as unix and open vms products as a result of the acquisitions of surveycraft and integral solutions 
merger related 
spss incurred merger related costs of  in and  in related to acquisitions accounted for as pooling of interests  which costs include employee sign on bonuses  employee severance  facility costs  and various other expenses 
included in these costs is a charge for the consolidation of the company s united kingdom facilities of  in and a recovery of  in when the plan was revised based on the acquisition of integral solutions 
the united kingdom facility consolidation plan was established to achieve cost efficiencies through the elimination of redundant facilities and includes accruals of  for estimated lease charges   for estimated property tax charges   for the write off of leasehold improvements and  for dilapidation charges 
the united kingdom facility consolidation plan was revised in when spss was unable to secure suitable facilities in a competitive london real estate market

acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology costs were  in and related to the acquisitions of surveycraft and integral solutions accounted for under the purchase method 
acquired in process technology costs were  in and related to an acquisition of the verbastat software product from datastat 
in november  spss acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of surveycraft  a provider of market research software in the pacific rim 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with the project had not reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use other than as market research software 
spss carefully assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
future cash flows were projected over five years discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
spss believes the discount rate is appropriate given the level of risk of unsuccessful completion of the technology as it was estimated to be approximately complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting the future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage which spss could provide to the surveycraft products 
in december  spss acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of integral solutions  a leading provider of data mining software 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with several projects had not reached technological feasibility and were believed to have no alternative future use other than as data mining tools 
spss carefully assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
future cash flows were projected over five years discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from to depending on the project and the market risks associated with each of the research and development projects and resulting products 
specific consideration was given to the stage of development of each research and development effort  which ranged from to complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements

specific consideration was given to the stage of development of the research and development effort  which was complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage that spss could provide to the verbastat product 
net interest income expense 
net interest income was  in primarily due to interest earned on short term investments 
net interest expense was  in and  in primarily due to interest expense incurred on line of credit borrowings 
other income expense 
other income expense was  in and  in and consists mainly of foreign exchange transactions

liquidity and capital resources spss long term debt as of december  consists of a mortgage on property in the united kingdom and the balance of the purchase price due datastat  sa for the acquisition of the verbastat product 
as of december   spss held approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
funds in were used primarily for payments related to spss acquisitions  as well as new computer systems for use in internal product development and expenditures made for an office move in sweden 
funds in were used primarily for payments related to office space expansions  new sales force automation and accounting system  upgrades of computing systems  integration of previous acquisitions  strategic investments  and the hiring of sales and professional services personnel in advance of revenues 
in may  the company renewed its loan agreement with american national bank and trust company of chicago 
under the loan agreement  spss has an available  unsecured line of credit  under which borrowings bear interest at either the prime interest rate or the eurodollar rate  depending on the circumstances 
as of december   spss had  outstanding under this line of credit 
the company s agreement with american national requires spss to comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests  and  among other things  restricts the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations where spss is not the surviving entity  sell assets  engage in select transactions with affiliates  and amend its organizational documents or make changes in its capital structure 
as a result of the company s merger with showcase in february  spss expects to extinguish its borrowings under the line of credit during at december   showcase had cash and cash equivalents of over  spss anticipates the amounts available from cash and cash equivalents on hand  under its line of credit  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  no assurance can be given that changing business circumstances will not require additional capital for reasons that are not currently anticipated or that the necessary additional capital will then be available to spss on favorable terms or at all 
the company s capital expenditures  primarily for computer systems  leasehold improvements and office furniture totaled approximately  in and are projected to total approximately  in and  in spss intends capital expenditures during to include new computers  primarily for use in internal product development  replacement of its systems for accounting and order entry  as well as furnishings and other equipment related to the move of the company s facilities in kilburn  uk  and expansion of facilities in chicago  miami  woking  uk  denmark  and australia 
spss does not believe that the implementation of its business strategy will require substantial additional capital expenditures in comparison with historical levels of product development costs and other expenses 
international operations significant growth in the company s international operations also occurred from to revenues from international operations comprised approximately to of total net revenues between and they were approximately of total net revenues in following the reorganization of its international operations in  spss has maintained substantially the same direct sales and telesales organizations worldwide 
the international sales organization uses more independent distributors than the domestic sales organization  primarily in countries without an spss sales office 
management believes the profit margins associated with the company s domestic and international operations are essentially the same 
as international revenues increase  spss may experience additional foreign currency exchange risk 
to mitigate these effects  spss hedges its transaction exposure ie  the effect on earnings and cash flows of changes in foreign exchange rates on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
spss does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
accordingly  the company s reported revenues and net income have been and in the future may be affected by the changes in foreign exchange rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured line of credit that bears interest at either the prime rate or the eurodollar rate 
as of december   the company had  outstanding under this line of credit 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional  of annual interest expense  assuming the same level of borrowing 
the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
since a substantial portion of the company s operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  the company s results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations to currency exchange rates  the company enters into various financial instruments  such as options 
these instruments generally mature within months 
gains and losses on these instruments are recognized in other income or expense 
were the foreign currency exchange rates to depreciate immediately and uniformly against the us dollar by percent from levels at december   management expects this would have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial results
