item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our business we are developing proprietary devices to deliver radiation to prevent the recurrence of blockages in arteries following balloon angioplasty  vascular stenting  arterial bypass surgery and other interventional treatments of blockages in coronary and peripheral arteries 
we incorporate our proprietary rdx technology into catheter based systems that deliver beta radiation to the site of a treated blockage in an artery in order to decrease the likelihood of restenosis 
restenosis is the recurrence of a blockage following interventional therapy 
the application of beta radiation inside the artery at the site of a blockage has proven clinically effective in inhibiting cell proliferation  a cause of restenosis 
prior to june  we focused on manufacturing and selling a broad range of angioplasty catheters and stent products  including our focus technology product line 
as catheter and stent products became widely available and subject to increasing price pressure  we shifted our focus to the research and development of radiation therapy devices to treat restenosis 
since june  we have acquired the portion of our former radiance medical systems subsidiary that we did not already own  which was researching and developing radiation therapy treatment devices to prevent blockages in arteries following interventional treatments  sold our vascular access product line and related assets  licensed our proprietary focus balloon technology to guidant for use in guidant s stent delivery systems  and reduced our direct sales force 
we continue to sell our remaining stent and catheter products  including our focus technology products  on a limited basis through medical device distributors 
development and operations we plan to continue to dedicate our corporate resources to completing clinical trials of the rdx system  obtaining regulatory approvals for the rdx system  and continuing research and development activities related to devices for the delivery of radiation to treat restenosis 
over the past few years  our source of revenues has shifted gradually from direct sales to royalties from licenses involving our products 
we are a party to several agreements for the distribution of products incorporating our focus technology and other existing products in the united states and other countries  the most significant of which is our license agreement with guidant 
in june  we entered into a technology license agreement with guidant  granting guidant rights  including exclusive rights in the united states  to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents 
in exchange  we received milestone payments based upon the transfer of the technological knowledge to guidant  and continue to receive royalty payments based upon the sale of products by guidant using the focus technology 
the payments under the guidant license are the primary source of our existing revenues 
until we obtain regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize the rdx system  we anticipate that our revenues will continue to decline as sales of products incorporating our licensed technology decline and as our technology becomes obsolete 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have experienced an operating loss for each of the last three years and expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least the end of our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly in the future 
our quarterly operating results depend upon several factors  including the timing and amount of expenses associated with development of the rdx system  the progress of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  varying product sales by our licensee  variations in foreign exchange rates  and third party payors reimbursement policies 
we do not operate with a significant backlog of customer orders  and therefore revenues in any quarter are significantly dependent on orders received during that quarter 
in addition  we cannot predict ordering rates by distributors  some of whom place infrequent stocking orders 
our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to adjust in response to fluctuating revenues 
organizational history we were formed in  and our common stock began trading publicly in the current radiance medical systems  inc resulted from our acquisition of the portion of our former radiance medical systems subsidiary that we did not already own 
we originally incorporated the former radiance as a separate entity to focus on the research and development of radiation therapy to treat cardiovascular disease  and to obtain outside sources of financing for such research and development 
in january  we paid approximately million in stock   in cash  and million in common stock options to acquire the portion of the former radiance that we did not already own 
in addition  the stockholders and option holders of the former radiance may still receive a product development milestone payment of up to for each share of preferred stock and for each share of common stock of the former radiance 
the milestone payment may be increased up to  or reduced or eliminated if the milestone is reached earlier or later  respectively  than the milestone target date 
the first three milestones were not achieved

results of operations comparison of years ended december  and sales 
sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in june  we licensed to guidant our focus technology for use with stents 
in january  we sold our vascular access product line and related assets and acquired the former radiance 
as a result of the license to guidant and increased competition for angioplasty catheter products  sales of our focus technology products decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in year ended december  as a result of our sale of the vascular access product line  there were no sales of vascular access products in the year ended december  compared to  in sales in the year ended december license fee and other 
license fee and other revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in  we signed a technology license agreement with guidant  which resulted in million in milestone related license fees and  in royalties in and million in royalties in in addition  in and  we recognized  in minimum royalties under the asset sale and purchase agreement with escalon medical corporation escalon for the vascular access product line and related assets 
in february  we amended the asset sale and purchase agreement with escalon regarding the payment of royalties 
 of royalties  of which  was outstanding at december   and due in the first quarter of  will be paid with  shares of escalon common stock with an estimated fair value of  an interest bearing note due in january for  and cash of  additionally  we received an interest bearing note for  payable from april through january  to secure the remaining minimum royalties due under the aforementioned agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in sales to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase was additional spending on clinical trials and development of pilot production for the rdx system 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease primarily was the result of the expiration of a marketing allowance for cathex  our japanese focus technology distributor  in the fourth quarter of reductions in our international sales force and related expenses also contributed to the decrease in expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to higher legal costs associated with the endosonics litigation and to a higher incidence of bad debt expense in compared with charge for acquired in process research and development 
we recognized a charge of million in the year ended december  we incurred the charge for the acquisition in january of the shares of the former radiance medical systems that we did not already own 
other income expense 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  interest income increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a increase in invested cash from our secondary offering in october gain on sale of assets decreased to million in from million in the primary source for the gain on sale of assets was the sale of an option to purchase certain equity investments held by us 
because the option expired  without exercise  in december  we anticipate that other income will be significantly lower for  compared with the gain included million from the sale of the assets of the vascular access product line and related assets 
comparison of years ended december  and sales 
sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  due to the licensing of our focus technology to guidant in june  reductions in our domestic sales force  the sale of our vascular access product line and related assets in january  and increased competition  sales of our focus technology products decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in year ended december  additionally  because of our sale of the vascular access product line  sales of our vascular access products decreased to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  license fee and other 
license fee and other revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in june  we signed a technology license agreement with guidant  which resulted in million in milestone related license fees in and million in milestone related license fees and  in royalties in in addition  in  we recognized  in minimum royalties under the sale agreement for our vascular access product line and related assets 
cost of sales 
the cost of sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to million from licensing fees received in that had no associated cost of sales and to relatively lower product sales compared with we agreed to produce vascular access products for six months following the sale of our vascular access product line and related assets in january on a cost plus reimbursement basis for the acquiring company and extended that commitment until december thus  the margin that we earned on sales of such products was substantially lower in compared with research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase was additional spending on development of and clinical trials for the rdx system 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease primarily was the result of reductions in our domestic and international sales force and related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower bad debt expense in compared with charge for acquired in process research and development 
we recognized a charge of million in the year ended december  and a charge of  in the year ended december  we incurred the charge for the acquisition in january of the shares of the former radiance medical systems that we did not already own 
we incurred the charge upon exercise in september of a warrant to purchase additional equity securities in the former radiance  which exercise resulted in our ownership of approximately of the former radiance  and thus an acquisition of a controlling interest 
other income expense 
other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  interest income decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a reduction of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during  due to the use of funds for operations  the purchase of treasury stock and capital expenditures 
gain on sale of assets increased to million in from a loss of  in due mainly to the sale of the assets of the vascular access product line and related assets in january other income expense increased to  in from an expense of  in due primarily to other income from the sale of an option to purchase equity securities we hold as an investment 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily by selling our equity securities  obtaining advances from endosonics  our former parent company and the selling stockholder in this offering  licensing our technologies  and entering into international product distribution agreements 
prior to our initial public offering in  we raised an aggregate of approximately million from the private sales of preferred and common stock and million in working capital advances from endosonics  which we repaid during the third quarter of in the second quarter of  we closed our initial public offering of common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering 
in the third quarter of  scimed life systems  inc exercised  common stock warrants  obtained from us through a stock purchase and technology license agreement  for  we also received  from the sale of  shares of our common stock to cathex  ltd 
under a may agreement that gave cathex exclusive product distribution rights in japan for our existing products until january  the distribution agreement with cathex was terminated in the fourth quarter of in january  we also sold substantially all of our vascular access product line and related assets to escalon medical corporation for approximately million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  we granted cosmotec co  ltd 
of japan the exclusive distribution rights to market our vascular radiation therapy products in japan 
we received million from cosmotec as an upfront cash payment and began recognizing income ratably over the seven year term of the agreement 
as part of the transaction with cosmotec  in august  we acquired a interest  for  in a new joint venture with an affiliate of cosmotec 
the joint venture  named radiatec  was formed to gain regulatory approval of and provide distribution for the rdx system in japan 
we borrowed million from cosmotec and recorded million in debt in june to reflect the fair value of the  million face amount convertible debenture 
on september   cosmotec converted the debenture into  shares of our common stock at per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  we entered into a two year contract manufacturing agreement with bebig gmbh to activate the radioactive sources and complete final assembly of the rdx system using our proprietary processes 
pursuant to the agreement  bebig will build a facility for the production of the rdx system 
we paid bebig  and  during and  respectively  and will pay approximately  in for facility set up fees under a amendment to the agreement 
in february  we agreed to a second and third amendment to the manufacturing agreement 
the second amendment calls for expansion of the production capacity and we will pay additional charges of  in in the first half of  we will prepare the additional manufacturing equipment to be used by bebig to perform the final assembly of the rdx system  estimated to cost approximately  and bebig will purchase the equipment from us at cost 
the third amendment increases the amount we will pay bebig for each unit produced and sets a minimum monthly facility charge of  beginning in the month the first product is manufactured  but not later than april we also will pay all material and third party costs associated with production validation and an agreed amount for each unit produced  ranging from approximately to depending upon the volume of units produced 
the cost of the facility set up fees  equipment costs and other costs could increase materially as the design of the production processes and facilities evolves over the coming year 
we have expensed all costs incurred by us with bebig as research and development costs 
in conjunction with the contract manufacturing agreement  in july  we entered into a three year sub license agreement to use bebig s exclusive license of the hehrlein patents for radiation technology that may be useful in the development of the rdx system 
pursuant to this sub license agreement  we must pay to bebig royalty fees  subject to offsets for certain payments under a related manufacturing agreement  for any products sold by us worldwide that incorporate the licensed technology 
the sub license is subject to renewal  without cost  through the expiration dates of bebig s patents 
in october  we sold in a secondary offering  and  shares of our common stock held in treasury and newly issued  respectively 
we received million in net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used resulted primarily from higher research  development and clinical expenses for compared with we believe that research and development expenses relating to the rdx system will increase  as will costs associated with commercialization of the rdx system if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals 
we plan to begin selling the rdx system in europe once we receive ce mark approval  which we expect to receive in the first half of at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we expect to incur substantial costs related to  among other things  clinical testing  product development  marketing and sales of the rdx system  and expect to utilize increased levels of working capital prior to achieving positive cash flow from operations 
we anticipate that our cash and anticipated revenues from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations through the second quarter of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical trials  the regulatory approval process  the costs involved in intellectual property rights enforcement or litigation  competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  and the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties 
we may need to raise funds through additional financings  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with existing or new corporate partners 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to grant rights to certain technologies or products that we would not otherwise grant 
trade accounts receivable  net  decreased to  at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from lower product sales 
other receivables increased to million at december  from  at december  the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in the license revenue receivable from guidant of million for licensed product sales during the fourth quarter of inventory increased to million at december  from  at december  the increase was due primarily to relatively higher rdx system materials inventory and production for research and development and clinical units 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the expiration of a marketing allowance for cathex  our japanese focus technology products distributor  following the termination of the distribution agreement in the fourth quarter of deferred revenue decreased to  at december  from million at december  the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of deferred revenue on the sale of an option and deferred license revenue during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
an investment involves a high degree of risk 
risks related to our business we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability 
from our formation in to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to incur losses through at least  and it is possible that we may never achieve profitability 
even if we eventually generate revenues from sales and achieve profitability  we nevertheless expect to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  and our expenditures related to clinical testing and product development 
our ability to become profitable will depend on the time and expense necessary to research and develop the rdx system  whether and how quickly we obtain regulatory approvals for the rdx system  and our success in bringing the rdx system to market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for the rdx system 
we need to conduct additional human clinical trials for the rdx system 
the rdx system is the only product we have under development and has not been approved for marketing by the food and drug administration  or fda  the nuclear regulatory commission  or nrc  or by any government entity outside of the united states 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop the product  conduct clinical trials and gain regulatory approvals for the rdx system 
prior to granting approval  the fda or foreign regulatory bodies may require more information or clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  or more clinical studies  which could require significant additional expenditures 
if granted  the fda or other foreign regulatory body approval may impose limitations on the uses for which or how we may market the rdx system 
should we experience delays or be unable to obtain regulatory approvals  we may never generate significant revenues  and our business prospects will be substantially impaired 
our operations are capital intensive  and we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our operations 
our activities are capital intensive 
we currently are spending cash at a rate of approximately million per month  and based on our current plans  we expect this rate of spending to increase to approximately million per month in the second quarter of and continue for at least the next to months 
although we believe that our cash and anticipated revenues from operations will be sufficient to meet our planned capital requirements at least through the second quarter of  we may require additional capital during that time or thereafter 
our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development programs for the rdx system  the scope and results of our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for the rdx system  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities  and our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties 
to finance these activities  we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
we may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms  or not at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we issue debt securities  these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock  and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations 
we might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which would impair our future prospects 
even if we receive necessary regulatory approval  we may not be able to commercialize the rdx system successfully 
the rdx system and related products that we intend to develop are in the early stages of development and require significant research  development and testing 
our development of these products is subject to the risks of failure commonly experienced in the development of new products based on innovative or novel technologies 
any or all of these proposed technologies and products may prove to be ineffective  unsafe or uneconomical to manufacture commercially 
even if our products are safe and effective  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture or market them successfully  either on our own or through third parties  or that we will manage the expansion of our operations successfully 
if we receive regulatory approval for our products  we will need to grow rapidly 
rapid growth may strain the capabilities of our managers  operations and facilities and  consequently  could harm our business 
if we obtain the required regulatory approvals for the rdx system  commercial scale production will require us to expand our operations 
rapid growth may strain our managerial and other organizational resources 
our ability to manage our growth will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to operate or contract with production facilities that can handle the radiation sources required for the manufacture of the rdx system  manage the simultaneous manufacture of different products efficiently and integrate the manufacture of new products with existing product lines  address difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  and implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
we rely on a single vendor to supply our radioactive sources and perform final assembly of the rdx system  and any disruption in our supply could curtail our operations severely and adversely affect our profitability 
although we manufacture components and sub assemblies for the rdx system  we do not apply the beta radiation 
we have contracted with a third party manufacturer in germany  bebig gmbh  to perform the final assembly and radioactive source manufacturing of the rdx system for use in europe 
bebig has produced only minor quantities of units for testing purposes for us under the manufacturing agreement  as we are in the process of setting up the bebig radiation facility 
we expect to complete the facility set up during the first half of we expect to enter into a similar manufacturing supply relationship with a manufacturer in the united states 
currently  we rely on a small  us based manufacturer to supply us with radioactive source balloons for use in research and clinical trials 
our reliance on a sole source supplier in the united states and europe may reduce our leverage in negotiating the terms of manufacturing and supply agreements with these manufacturers and could  therefore  reduce our profitability 
in addition  our reliance on sole source manufacturers exposes our operations and profitability to disruptions in supply caused by failure of our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements  any strike or work stoppage  disruptions in shipping  a natural disaster caused by fire  floods or earthquakes  a supply shortage experienced by one of our sole source manufacturers  and the fiscal health and manufacturing strength of our contract manufacturer 
the occurrence of any of the above disruptions in supply or other unforeseen events that could cause a disruption in supply from our sole source contract manufacturers likely would cause us to lose sales and possibly market share and could halt or delay our research and development and clinical trials 
because of the short shelf life of the rdx system  it is unlikely that we would have sufficient inventory to mitigate the adverse impact of any supply disruption 
in addition  the risk of a supply disruption could occur because our suppliers fail to comply with extensive radiation safety regulations in the united states  europe and other countries 
the complexity of these regulations and the danger inherent in handling radioactive material increases the possibility of a supply disruption by one of our contract manufacturers 
because we do not have alternative suppliers and manufacturers  our sales and profitability would be harmed in the event of a disruption 
the short shelf life of the rdx system will require us to develop an efficient distribution system and increases the likelihood of product waste  reduced margins and losses 
the beta radiation we use in the rdx system has a relatively short half life 
therefore  we expect the rdx system to have a shelf life of approximately days  which will make it critical for us and for our contract manufacturers to ship the products as close to the date of use as possible before the radioactive isotope decays into stable  non radioactive elements 
to do this  we will need to develop an efficient distribution system with a high degree of coordination among us  a contract manufacturer  the distributor  the shipping carrier and the end user 
if we fail to establish adequate shipping and logistic capabilities or manufacturing sources  we will be unable to commercialize the rdx system successfully 
moreover  even if we establish an efficient distribution system  any disruption or lack of coordination will result in product waste  which would reduce our margins and may make sales of the rdx system unprofitable 
our international sales expose our business to a variety of risks that could result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations 
we made approximately of our total sales in to foreign purchasers  particularly in countries located in europe and asia 
because we anticipate that the rdx system will receive regulatory approval in foreign markets beginning in the first half of and will not receive regulatory approval in the us until or later  a significant portion of our sales is and will continue to be subject to the risks of international business  including fluctuations in foreign currencies  trade disputes  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  the possibility of quotas  duties  taxes or other changes or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products being implemented by the united states or these foreign countries  timing and availability of import export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties collecting accounts receivable  difficulties complying with laws  increased tax exposure if our revenues in foreign countries are subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  accepting customer purchase orders governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from us laws and limit our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements and to collect damages  if awarded  and the general economies of the countries in which we transact business 
the use of radioactive material in our product may increase our risk in the event of product liability claims or accidental exposure 
our third party manufacturers must comply with extensive radiation safety regulations in the united states  europe and other countries that govern the import export  manufacture  distribution  use and disposal of radioactive materials 
for example bebig and any other manufacturer  supplier and distributor must obtain licenses from united states and international nuclear regulators  as applicable  such as the us nrc  to distribute radiation sources commercially  bebig or any other manufacturer  supplier and distributor must comply with us or international nuclear regulations  us department of transportation and international air transport association regulations  as applicable  governing the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or to the other users of the rdx system  and hospitals may need to obtain or expand their licenses to use and handle beta radiation prior to using the rdx system 
violations of these regulations and laws by us  our suppliers or our distributors  or any malfunctions of our system or errors by hospitals and physicians in administering treatment  could result in accidental contamination or injury  as well as unexpected remedial costs and penalties 
any such violation or incident could adversely impact the market for our system or lead to suspension of our trials or cessation of sales of the rdx system 
regulatory enforcement action such as civil penalties or license suspension or revocation likewise could lead to suspension of our clinical trials or cessation of sales 
even if our clinical trials or product sales are not affected  we may need to spend substantial funds to litigate and defend ourselves from any claims or pay any settlements 
in addition  because the rdx system is a new treatment  any similar regulatory violations or incidents involving our competitors could reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval for the rdx system or could delay or erode acceptance of the rdx system by physicians and patients 
in the event of an accidental release of radioactive material into a patient  we may face significant liability to the patient  to medical personnel exposed to the release and to other third parties affected by the exposure 
although we maintain product liability insurance  in the event of such a release  our liability would be difficult to estimate  as it would depend on such factors as the nature and extent of the exposure to the radiation and the probable long term effects of such an exposure 
the liability could materially exceed our product liability insurance limits 
a significant percentage of our revenues come from our focus technology license agreement with guidant 
our current and future revenues partially depend on the number of stent delivery systems that incorporate our focus technology that are sold by guidant corporation 
approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december  were revenues pursuant to a license agreement with guidant 
this agreement grants guidant the right to manufacture and distribute stent delivery products using our focus technology  including exclusive rights within the united states 
under the agreement  we receive royalty payments based upon the sale of products using the focus technology 
we expect that our revenues from the guidant license agreement will decline over the next few years as technological changes in the stent market make our focus stent technology obsolete 
our revenues may decline precipitously  and our business may be harmed  if guidant terminates the license agreement  is unable to sell stent delivery systems that incorporate our focus technology  or does not incorporate our focus technology into future generations of its stent delivery systems 
we will need to devote significant resources to market our products and technology to physicians in order to achieve market acceptance 
if we fail to achieve market acceptance  our business will suffer 
although the fda has recently approved a johnson johnson gamma radiation device and a novoste beta radiation device  we cannot predict the clinical acceptance by physicians of the rdx system or other products integrating radiation versus more conventional  minimally invasive treatments 
we also cannot predict how the short shelf life of our products will affect clinical acceptance by physicians 
other companies may have superior resources to market similar products or technologies or have superior technologies and products to market 
therefore  even if our products gain regulatory approval  we will need to spend significant resources prior to achieving market acceptance 
any failure of our products to achieve commercial acceptance  or any inability on our part to devote the requisite resources necessary to market our products  will harm our business 
we may rely on third party distributors to sell and market the rdx system 
they may do so ineffectively 
we may depend on medical device distributors and certain strategic relationships  some of which may be with our competitors  to distribute the rdx system 
significant consolidation among medical device suppliers has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers like us to distribute products effectively without a relationship with one or more of the major suppliers 
consequently  we may enter into agreements with third parties to distribute the rdx system 
if we enter into such relationships  we will depend directly on their efforts to market the rdx system  yet we will be unable to control their efforts completely 
if our distributors fail to market and sell the rdx system effectively  our operating results and business may suffer substantially  or we may have to make significant additional expenditures to market the rdx system effectively 
the rdx system relies upon our non exclusive sub license of the hehrlein patents from bebig 
if bebig terminates the sub license  we may be forced to re configure our existing base technology and seek new regulatory approvals 
we own two united states patent and own several pending patent applications relating to the proprietary devices comprising the rdx system 
we also have obtained a non exclusive license from bebig to utilize technology covered by the hehrlein patents concerning the uniform application of radiation to a balloon 
the license with bebig terminates in july  although either party may renew the sub license through the date that the hehrlein patents expire 
furthermore  either party may terminate the sub license for material breach 
in the event that bebig terminates the sub license  we may be forced to re design the rdx system to allow for the application of radiation to the balloon catheter in a manner that is still effective in treating restenosis  and also may need to seek new regulatory approvals  which would substantially delay product sales 
the market for our products is highly competitive  and competing medical device technologies may prove more effective in treating these conditions than our product candidates 
competition in the market for devices used in the treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease is intense  and we expect it to increase 
the rdx system and other potential products will compete with treatment methods that are well established in the medical community  as well as treatments based on new technologies 
we face competition from manufacturers of other catheter based atherectomy devices  vascular stents and pharmaceutical products intended to treat vascular disease 
in the next few years  we expect to face competition from treatments based on new technologies that novoste corporation  johnson johnson  guidant and others are developing 
the most significant treatments that pose a competitive challenge to us include novoste s beta radiation seed based system  which is available in the us and europe  johnson johnson s gamma radiation wire based system  which is available in the us and europe  guidant s beta radiation wire based system  which is available in europe and is currently being considered by the fda for pre market approval  drugs and drug coated stents  other radioactive wire based systems  and other technologies in various phases of development  including gene therapy  x ray and ultrasound 
any of these treatments could prove to be more effective or may achieve greater market acceptance than the rdx system 
even if these treatments are not as effective as the rdx system  many of the companies pursuing these treatments and technologies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  more extensive research and development capability  established market positions  and larger sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  we believe that many of the purchasers and potential purchasers of our competitors products prefer to purchase catheter and stent products from a single source 
accordingly  many of our competitors  because of their size and range of product offerings  will have an advantage over us 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this fluctuation may negatively impact our stock price in the future 
because the rdx system is still in the research and development phase  we cannot predict when  if ever  we will have revenues based on the sales of the rdx system 
also  our current revenues are attributable primarily to a license agreement with guidant  which limits our ability to predict future revenues 
moreover  we expect revenues pursuant to the license agreement with guidant to diminish in the future as technology changes 
in addition to the foregoing factors  our quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to the conduct of clinical trials  the timing of regulatory approvals  the relatively short shelf life of the rdx system that will require us to ship the product as close as possible to its expected date of use  and the consequent lack of a significant order backlog will make it difficult to forecast future revenues and operating results  reductions in the size  delays in the timing or cancellation of significant customer orders  fluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  the mix between pilot production of new products and full scale manufacturing of existing products  changes in the proportion between domestic and export sales  variations in foreign exchange rates  and changes in third party payors reimbursement policies 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparison of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock  which could cause you to lose some or all of the value of your investment 
if we do not attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
we require skilled personnel to develop  manufacture and sell the rdx system 
our business and future operating results also depend in significant part on our ability to continue to hire  train  retain and motivate additional skilled personnel  particularly regulatory  clinical  manufacturing  technical  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining such personnel 
our inability to attract and retain skilled employees as needed could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our industry our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the fda and similar agencies in foreign countries 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities  an extensive fda review process and other costly and time consuming procedures 
it often takes companies several years to satisfy these requirements  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
we also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of the most important requirements we face include fda pre market approval process  us  individual state and foreign nuclear requirements  california department of health services requirements  iso en certification  us department of transportation and international air transport association requirements  and european union ce mark requirements 
government regulation may impede our ability to conduct clinical trials and to manufacture the rdx system and other prospective products 
government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities 
the fda and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could impede our marketing of any proposed products and reduce our product revenues 
further  regulations may change  and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies  which could harm our business 
we also could be subject to new federal  state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways 
if this happens  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations 
we cannot predict the extent to which third party payors may provide reimbursement for the use of our products 
our success in marketing products based on novel or innovative technology  such as the rdx system  depends in large part on whether domestic and international government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse customers for the cost of our product 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
further  many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
we cannot assure you that sufficient reimbursement will be available for the rdx system  in either the united states or internationally  to establish and maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the development of our new products 
if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our new products  it will be very difficult for us to market our products to doctors and hospitals  and we may not achieve commercial success 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement 
a failure to protect our technology may affect our business negatively 
the market for medical devices is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately 
our success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the united states and internationally 
we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology 
however  we face the risks that we may fail to secure necessary patents prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances  thereby permitting competitors to market competing products  and our already granted patents may be reexamined  reissued or invalidated 
we also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties 
we cannot be certain that any of the confidentiality agreements will be honored or  if breached  that we would have enough remedies to protect our confidential information 
further  our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies 
to the extent that our consultants  key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop  disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information and there is no guarantee that such disputes will be resolved in our favor 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  our business and commercial prospects likely will suffer 
if our current products infringe upon the intellectual property of our competitors  our sale of these products may be challenged and we may have to defend costly and time consuming infringement claims 
we may need to engage in expensive and prolonged litigation to assert any of our rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties 
with no certainty as to the outcome  litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue 
our failure to pursue litigation could result in the loss of our rights that could hurt our business substantially 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  if at all 
our failure to obtain rights to intellectual property of third parties or the potential for intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  making or using our products that use the disputed intellectual property  obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling  making or using our products  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign our products or services  and subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products and may suffer severe financial harm 
whether or not an intellectual property claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
we may face product liability that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims 
although we never have been subject to a product liability claim  we cannot assure you that there will not be any claims brought against us in the future 
even then  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of our products and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products 
the price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop 
in particular  the market price of securities of small medical device companies  like ours  has been very unpredictable and may vary in response to announcements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations  introductions of new products  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  public concern over the safety of radiation based therapeutic products  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  changes in healthcare policy in the united states or other countries  and general stock market conditions 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval 
any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
these provisions may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 
substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and make it difficult for you to recover the full value of your investment in our shares 
most of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares or the perception that such sales could occur 
these factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
we have approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of these shares are freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act  except for  shares subject to volume limitations and other restrictions of rule item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   the portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because of the relative insignificance of our foreign subsidiaries and because our international transactions are denominated primarily in us dollars
