the following management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation  as well as information contained elsewhere in this report  contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of us  our directors or our officers with respect to  among other things the ability of our product offerings to compete in the asic market  the competitive advantages of our products  the outcome of current litigation in which we are involved and the expected success of our new product lines 
the success of our business operations is  in turn  dependent on factors such as market acceptance of our current and future products  our ability to timely and continually introduce new products and make our current products better  the ability of our subcontractors to manufacture  assemble  test and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of wafers to meet demand  general competitive conditions within the semiconductor industry and general economic conditions as set forth under future events  risk factors below and elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
overview we design  manufacture and market high performance  high density  programmable logic devices and associated computer aided engineering logic development tools 
programmable logic devices are semiconductor chips that may be programmed on site  using software tools that run on personal computers or engineering workstations 
user benefits include ease of use  lower risk and fast time to market 
our cmos based programmable logic devices address high speed  high density and low power applications in the telecommunications  data communications  computer peripheral and industrial markets 
flex and apex products are our sram based line of embedded array programmable logic devices  and max products are our line of eeprom and eprom based macrocell programmable logic devices 
we classify our products into the following categories 
all prior year data have been restated to reflect the following compositions new products consist of apex ke  apex kc  max b  acex k  excalibur families mainstream products include max a  max a  flex  flex ka  flex ke  apex k families mature and other products include classic  max  max  max s  max  flex  flex k and flashlogic r families  tools  mplds  configuration devices and northwest logic design services in general  customers prefer products with lower supply voltages because they use less power and dissipate less heat  normally resulting in lower overall system cost 
lower supply voltages result from more advanced fabrication processes and yield higher performance at a lower cost 
thus  supply voltage correlates with product maturity lower supply voltages represent newer products 
results of operations sales sales were  million in  million in and million in sales increased in from and in from increases in sales  in both years  were primarily due to higher unit sales in all product categories 
the increases in sales were partially offset by decreases in average unit selling prices 
sales of new products  which began shipping during the fourth quarter of  were million in and marginal in sales of mainstream products were million  higher than sales of million 
sales of mature and other products were million  higher than sales of million 
as a percentage of sales  new products  mostly introduced in  represented of sales in mainstream products represented of sales in as compared to in and in mature and other products represented of sales in as compared to in and in our new and mainstream products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years 
these products have similar or improved features and comparable or higher densities than their predecessors  but advanced process technology enables us to produce these products at a lower cost than previous generations of products 
consistent with their lower cost structure  we have priced these products at a significant discount to our more mature products in order to stimulate demand and broaden the appeal of programmable logic 
as a result  we experienced a shift in customer demand to our newer  lower priced offerings from the more mature products 
new and mainstream products were of total sales in as compared to in and in our management believes that lower prices on our newer product families will enable our product offering to compete more favorably with gate array and standard cell technologies  which represent significant market opportunities 
during  additional unit sales more than offset the lower selling prices and our management believes that over time this will continue  but we cannot assure you that this will occur 
in  unit sales of mainstream products increased  while average unit selling prices decreased 
in october  we sold to cypress semiconductor corporation the exclusive right to manufacture  market and sell our max programmable logic device product family and our equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc we recorded a pre tax gain of million 
the sale of the max family did not materially affect our fiscal year revenues 
excluding the max product family  sales grew in and in year over year sales growth by product category years ended december  new n a n a mainstream mature and other total customer sectors during  we experienced strong sales in the communications market segment driven primarily by the networking and telecommunications sectors 
the communications market segment represented of our business in as compared to in and in the electronic data processing market segment was of sales in as compared to in and in the industrial market segment was percent of sales in as compared to in and in the consumer market segment was in as compared to in and in  and other markets were in as compared to in both and our management believes that future revenue growth will be driven by product demand in the communications market segment  but we cannot assure you that this will occur 
geographic areas north america sales were million in  higher than sales of million 
international sales included sales in europe  japan and asia pacific and were million in  higher than million in during  sales in europe were million  an increase of from million in in japan  sales were million  an increase of from million in and sales in asia pacific were million  an increase of from million in in  north america sales grew from  while sales in europe grew  japan grew and asia pacific grew 
sales for in total grew primarily due to strength in north american and japanese networking and telecommunications sectors 
as a percentage of total sales  sales in north america  europe and asia pacific increased  while sales in japan declined in compared to north america sales increased to of sales from in and in  europe increased to from in and was in  asia pacific increased to from in and in  while japan decreased to from in and in year over year sales growth by geographic area years ended december  north america europe japan asia pacific total international total major items in the statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows years ended december  cost of sales gross margin total research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations gain on sale of wafertech interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in  in and in the increases in gross margin were primarily attributable to cost reductions as a result of manufacturing process improvements 
yields on newer  lower voltage products continued to improve for the year ended december  this includes improvements in the apex k  apex ke  flex ke and flex ka product families 
we continue to spend a significant amount of financial resources to improve production yields on both new and established products 
difficulties in production yields can occur when we begin production of new products  transition to new processes or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another 
these difficulties can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
for example  from the fourth quarter of through the first half of  process control issues associated with wafertech s volume ramp up resulted in low die yields on flex ka and flex ke products leading to reduced product availability in these families 
as a result  we were unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels and in some cases could not meet end customer demand 
our management expects to continue to introduce new and established products using new process technologies and may encounter similar start up difficulties during the transition to such process technologies 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products which also may result in higher costs and lower product availability 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in and million  or of sales in for the year ended december   excluding the million one time acquired in process research and development charge  research and development expenses were million  or percent of sales 
historically  the level of research and development expenses as a percentage of sales has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and wafers used in the development of new products 
we expect that  in the long term  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars primarily due to our efforts to develop new products 
research and development expenses include expenditures for labor  masks  prototype wafers  the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from acquisitions  and expenses for the development of process technology  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
excluding the one time charge  research and development expenses increased million  or in and million  or in the increases in absolute dollars were primarily a result of increased headcount  additional spending on masks  prototype wafers  package development and the development of our quartus software and excalibur embedded processor solutions 
during  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for the acquisitions of designpro inc and right track cad inc 
which is being amortized to research and development expense over a period of two to four years 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation included in research and development expenses was million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to make significant investments in the development of apex k  apex ke  apex kc  quartus software  excalibur embedded processor solutions and future products 
during the first quarter of  we shipped apex k  a new family of devices  and quartus  our new fourth generation software design tool 
during the fourth quarter of  we began shipping our apex ke family of devices 
the rollout of the volt apex ke product family progressed further during the second quarter of  during which time we began shipping four new devices including the apex epke  the highest density programmable device available in commercial quantities 
the apex ke family offers advanced features over the apex k family including lower power consumption  faster performance  expanded i o support and smaller die sizes 
apex k and apex ke devices utilize a new architecture for programmable logic and address higher density designs 
apex k and apex ke devices are supported exclusively by our quartus software 
also during the second quarter of  we announced our new excalibur embedded processor solutions 
excalibur solutions combine programmable logic  memory and a processor core  allowing users to integrate an entire system on a single programmable logic device 
these solutions provide programmable flexibility and system level integration while bringing advanced processor technology to the broad marketplace 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we released upgraded versions of our quartus software which provide improved place and route technology and enhanced device support 
our management expects apex k and apex ke devices  quartus software and excalibur solutions to be successful in the marketplace  however  the commercial success of these products depends on market acceptance of the use of apex k and apex ke devices in high density designs  as well as the acceptance of the quartus design software and excalibur solutions 
we cannot assure you that any of our products will achieve market acceptance 
we also continue to focus our efforts on the development of new programmable logic chips  related development software and hardware and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
however  we cannot assure you that we will accomplish our goals in the development and subsequent introduction of new products and manufacturing processes 
also  we cannot assure you that our new products will achieve market acceptance  that the new manufacturing processes will be successful  or that our suppliers will provide us with the quality and quantity of wafers and materials that we require 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner to help counter the semiconductor industry s historical trend of declining prices as products mature 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in and million  or of sales in although total selling  general and administrative expenses increased  they decreased as a percentage of sales because of strong revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions and incentive expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs related to the direct sales force and field application engineers who work in over forty field sales offices worldwide and stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper selection of our products 
the customers then work with our distributors for order fulfillment and logistical requirements  as over of our sales are made through distributors 
our management intends to continue to increase sales resources in markets and regions where it anticipates this will increase sales  enhance competitive position or improve customer service 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or in and million  or in the increases in absolute dollars were mainly driven by increased headcount for sales  marketing and administration personnel  higher advertising and legal expenses  and higher commission and incentive expenses associated with increased sales 
in process research and development during  we recorded a non recurring charge of million to in process research and development related to the purchase of designpro and right track 
we determined this non recurring charge using valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry 
we immediately expensed this non recurring charge in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
see note income from operations income from operations was million  or of sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales in and million  or of sales in the year over year increases in operating income  as a percentage of sales  were primarily due to improvements in gross margin and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased research and development expenses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income was million  or of sales for the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales in and million  or of sales in for the year ended december   interest and other income included a one time pre tax gain of million from the sale of the max family and our equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc excluding the one time gain  interest and other income was million  or of sales 
excluding the one time gain  the increase from to  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to the increase in interest income related to higher investment balances and higher interest rates 
interest and other income consists mainly of interest income on investments in high quality fixed income securities 
in  interest and other income included interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes issued in june that was comprised of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs  net of capitalized interest related to the construction of our new headquarters 
in june  the subordinated notes were converted into common stock resulting in a decrease in interest expense during that year 
no interest expense has been incurred since the conversion 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in and excluding the one time gain on the sale of wafertech  which was taxed at our marginal rate  our effective tax rate for was 
the reduction of the effective tax rate  excluding the one time gain  primarily resulted from a change in the geographic source of income 
equity investment in june  we formed wafertech  llc  a joint venture company  with tsmc and several other partners to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in camas  washington 
in return for a million cash investment  we received an equity ownership in wafertech and certain obligations and rights to procure up to of wafertech s output at market prices 
in january  we purchased from analog devices  inc an additional equity ownership interest in wafertech for approximately million  increasing our ownership interest to 
this increased investment in wafertech provided us with additional obligations and rights to procure up to of wafertech s future output 
in october  the partners in wafertech contributed million in additional equity to support capital expansion plans and working capital requirements of wafertech 
our share of that contribution was million  we maintained our same ownership interest and rights to acquire wafertech s output 
we accounted for our investment under the equity method based on our ability to exercise significant influence over wafertech s operating and financial policies 
on december   we sold our ownership interest in wafertech to a subsidiary of tsmc for million in cash 
the one time pre tax gain on the sale of wafertech was million 
for the year ended december   our equity in the loss of wafertech was million as compared to a loss of million in and million in wafertech began production of silicon wafers in october and achieved volume production in in past years  wafertech had experienced lower than forecast production yields resulting in lower than forecast output 
during the year ended december   wafertech s production volumes and yields increased over the prior year and met our targeted levels 
although we sold our equity interest in wafertech in december  we expect to continue utilizing wafertech as one of our suppliers of silicon wafers 
future results  risks factors in addition to other information contained elsewhere in this report  the following important factors  among others  have affected and  in the future  could affect  our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
our financial results depend on our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
our industry is intensely competitive 
future operating results will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture and sell complex semiconductor components and programming software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors 
we may not succeed in developing  manufacturing or selling competitive products 
we are developing programmable chips for applications that are presently served by other asic vendors 
many of these vendors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and a solution that has been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in displacing asic vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
furthermore  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  our customers increasingly use standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the asic market  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our future success depends on our ability to define  develop and sell new products 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid product obsolescence 
we continue to focus our efforts on developing new programmable logic chips  related development software and hardware and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new products and manufacturing processes or that our products and processes will achieve market acceptance or be successful 
if we do not successfully define  develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance existing products in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  for the supply and quality of our finished silicon wafers 
we depend significantly upon subcontractors to manufacture silicon wafers and assemble  test and ship product to end customers 
we also depend on all of our subcontractors  and especially our principal foundry partner  tsmc  to improve process technologies in a timely manner to enhance our product designs and cost structure 
our success depends  in part  on tsmc s ability to remain successful in its highly competitive industry 
their inability to do so could have a severe negative impact on us 
the vast majority of our products are manufactured and shipped to customers by subcontractors located in asia  principally hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines and taiwan 
disruptions or adverse supply conditions arising from market conditions  political strife  labor disruptions and other factors could adversely affect our future results 
market demand for silicon wafers increased significantly through the third quarter of  while supply of such wafers increased at a much slower rate 
this resulted in a firmer pricing environment  less responsiveness to requests for expedited delivery by wafer suppliers  and in some cases  unsatisfied demand 
in general  the lead time to increase market wafer supply by building additional wafer fabrication facilities is approximately two years and in periods where demand for wafers increases rapidly for a prolonged period  market shortages tend to occur 
we believe that under circumstances of wafer scarcity it is important to have close business relationships with wafer suppliers in order to receive the desired quantity of product 
we believe that we enjoy close working relationships with our principal wafer supplier  tsmc 
in the latter half of  business conditions changed 
our management no longer believes demand exceeds the foundry industry s ability to supply silicon wafers 
our management further believes that the foundry s ability to supply our desired quantity of silicon wafers will remain through at least the first half of however  we cannot assure you that we will succeed in securing our total desired output from tsmc or that the possibility of future wafer scarcity will not impair or prevent any future growth of our business 
natural or man made disasters  normal process fluctuations and variances in manufacturing yields could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  in september  a major earthquake struck taiwan resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life 
the earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at our primary vendor  tsmc  for several days and then only limited production began 
nearly two weeks passed before full production resumed  and a portion of the inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake 
we have sought to diversify our operating risk by obtaining silicon wafers manufactured by wafertech  located in camas  washington 
wafertech began production of silicon wafers in october and achieved volume production in in past quarters  wafertech had experienced lower than forecast production yields resulting in lower than forecast output 
during  wafertech s production volumes and yields increased over prior periods and met our targeted levels 
although we sold our equity interest in wafertech in december  we expect to continue utilizing wafertech as one of our suppliers of silicon wafers 
see also manufacturing wafer supply in part i of this report for additional factors related to wafer supply that may affect our operating results 
we depend on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our semiconductor products 
although our assembly and other subcontractors have not recently experienced any serious work stoppages  the economic  social and political situations in countries where certain subcontractors are located are unpredictable and can be volatile 
any political strife  prolonged work stoppages or other inability to manufacture and assemble our products would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face significant future litigation expenses 
we own numerous patents and patent applications and have technology licensing agreements giving us rights to design  manufacture and package products using certain patents owned by others 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will provide meaningful protection from competition or that we will rely on such rights in developing additional products 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face significant future litigation expenses 
we have in the past incurred  and in the future may continue to incur  litigation expenses to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties 
we cannot assure you that any such litigation would be successful or that our patents would be upheld if challenged 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of inquiries received from third parties  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we cannot assure you that such licenses could be obtained  and  if obtainable  could be obtained on conditions which would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  if patent litigation ensued  we cannot assure you that these third parties would not succeed in obtaining significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
the results of present litigation could adversely affect our operating results 
we are a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party to lawsuits involving various types of claims  including  but not limited to  unfair competition and intellectual property matters 
legal proceedings tend to be unpredictable and costly and may be affected by events outside of our control 
there is no assurance that litigation will not have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our major litigation matters are described under item and note we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our revenue 
during each of the last three years  international sales constituted nearly half of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include government regulation of exports  tariffs and other potential trade barriers  adverse changes in tax laws  freight costs or interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and generally longer receivable collection periods 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future or what  if any  effect such actions would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial results are affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been subject to significant downturns as a result of diminished demand for semiconductor products  general reductions in semiconductor inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
if these or other conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future  there could be an adverse effect on our operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products price competition the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions product obsolescence the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the foundries of tsmc  sharp or wafertech changes in manufacturing yields adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales and support employees and on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the competition for such employees is intense and the loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price volatility and the price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the overall stock market  the prices of semiconductor stocks in general and the price of our stock may continue to fluctuate greatly 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter variances in financial results  announcements of new products  new orders and order rate variations by us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock prices for many high technology companies experience large fluctuations  which are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as a recessionary period or high interest rates  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after june  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain derivatives and hedging activities 
our adoption of sfas no 
 which became effective january   will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during  our operating activities generated net cash of million  which was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted by non cash items including an increase in income taxes payable of million  an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million  a decrease in other assets of million and the one time write off of million for acquired in process research and development 
these items were partially offset by an increase in inventories of million  an increase in deferred income taxes of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash from operating activities was also offset by the gain on the sale of wafertech of million 
total cash proceeds related to the wafertech sale of million was included as a cash inflow under investing activities 
during  our operating activities generated net cash of million  which was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted by non cash items including an increase in income taxes payable of million  an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in other assets of million  equity in loss of wafertech of million and a decrease in inventories of million 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in deferred income taxes of million and the gain on the sale of the max product family of million 
investing activities during  the net cash provided by investing activities was million  which was driven by cash proceeds of million from the sale of our equity interest in wafertech and net sales of short term investments of million 
these items were partially offset by cash payments of million for the acquisitions of designpro and right track and the purchase of long term investments totaling million 
in addition  we invested million primarily in land  manufacturing and data processing equipment and software  and building improvements in our headquarters and penang facilities 
during  the net cash used for investing activities was million 
we purchased million net of short term investments and made long term investments  mainly in wafertech  totaling million 
additionally  we invested million primarily for manufacturing and data processing equipment and software 
these items were partially offset by proceeds of million received from the sale of the max product family and our equity interest in cypress semiconductor texas  inc financing activities during  the net cash used for financing activities was million  which was driven by the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
the repurchase was partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees through various option and employee stock purchase plans 
in addition  we received million from the sale of put warrants 
during  the net cash used for financing activities was million  which was driven by the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
the repurchase was partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees through various option and employee stock purchase plans 
in addition  we received million from the sale of put warrants 
financial condition since our inception  we have used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash generated from operations to support our operating activities 
as of december   we had  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to finance our operating activities and future growth 
our management believes that capital expenditures will increase in primarily due to anticipated higher expenditures in manufacturing and data processing equipment as well as building improvements in our headquarters and penang facilities 
we believe the available sources of funds and cash we expect to generate from operations will be adequate to finance current operations  capital expenditures and common stock repurchases for at least the next year 
employees the number of employees was  in   in and  in  reflecting an increase of in and in impact of currency and inflation we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars  and transact our foreign sales in us dollars 
we have  in the past  entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations and to meet contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase malaysian ringgit to meet a portion of our firm contractual commitments to be paid in ringgits 
the contract will be settled in june we may enter into similar contracts from time to time should conditions appear favorable 
inflation has not significantly impacted our financial results 
as of december   we had no open foreign exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of  million as of december  and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiaries and branch operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   our financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure you there will not be a material impact in the future
