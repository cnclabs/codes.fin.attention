item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general candlewood owns  operates  franchises  manages and develops hotels serving mid market extended stay business travelers 
the following table sets forth our property portfolio as of december  and number of hotels number of rooms december  december  increase increase owned   leased   managed joint venture franchised   total    as of december   we had a total of company operated hotels which is comprised of owned  leased and joint venture hotels  two managed hotels and franchised hotels located in states 
in addition  at december   we had a total of one company owned hotel  three joint venture hotels and seven franchise hotels under construction 
of the three joint venture hotels under construction at december   two of the hotels are being constructed pursuant to the development agreement with boston capital and mass mutual 
the remaining joint venture hotel under construction is in east lansing  michigan and is being developed on the campus of michigan state university 
we also had one joint venture development site under contract to purchase at december  on which we were performing market feasibility due diligence 
this site  if purchased  would become a joint venture hotel pursuant to our development agreement with boston capital and mass mutual 
our consolidated statements of operations includes revenues and expenses for only those hotels which are consolidated subsidiaries of candlewood hotel company  inc owned and leased hotels 
revenues and expenses from franchise hotels and unconsolidated subsidiary hotels joint venture hotels accounted for under the equity method of accounting are not included in our revenues and expenses 
franchise fees  royalty fees  management fees  equity income from investment in joint ventures and other fees received from franchise and joint venture hotels are included in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
our results of operations are dependent upon our revenue per available room revpar which is a factor of occupancy and room rate 
accordingly  we intend to remain focused on occupancy levels at each of our newly opened hotels until such time as the occupancy levels reach stabilization 
traditionally  the overall occupancy rate for our corporate hotels which is comprised of owned and leased hotels has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the ramp up period for newly opened facilities 
this negative impact on occupancy is expected to diminish as the ratio of new property openings during a period to total properties in operation at the end of the period decreases 
see hotel operations revenue below for a breakdown by year of when our corporate hotels were opened 
once occupancy levels stabilize at a corporate hotel  we review the daily pricing rates of that hotel 
we believe that this practice is a prevailing standard in the us lodging industry 
in two separate sale leaseback transactions  we have sold and leased back certain of our hotels with hpt  a real estate investment trust 
the provisions of the transactions allow us to operate  as lessee  over a defined lease term  hotels that we developed 
the transactions were closed in stages  beginning in and ending in early we sold and leased back five hotels in  hotels in and three hotels in the results from operations for  and reflect the transactions 
as a result of the sale leaseback transactions  we have recorded rent expense on the hotels leased back from hpt 
since these hotels are leased and not owned  the financial statements do not reflect any depreciation and amortization or interest expense for these hotels after the date of sale 
the proceeds from the sale of the hotels is recorded net of the deferred gain on sale 
the gain is deferred and not recognized into earnings until certain operating performance levels are achieved 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a significant element of our future growth and expansion will be provided through the franchising of hotels 
additionally  we are actively marketing management contracts to existing and prospective franchisees to utilize our management experience and expertise to manage their hotels 
we intend to continue to pursue select hotel development opportunities  however  we can make no assurance that we will be able to develop hotels in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  hotel operations hotel operations revenue the following is a summary of hotel operations revenues for corporate hotels which is comprised of owned and leased hotels for the years ended december  and december  stratified by the year in which the hotels opened in thousands fiscal year number fiscal fiscal increase percentage opened of hotels revenues revenues decrease change   n a total    hotel operations revenue  which includes room revenue and other revenue eg guest telephone and sales of products from the candlewood cupboard  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue reflected the increased revenue generated by hotels that had completed or were near completion of their ramp up phase and the increase in the number of corporate hotels in operation during the year the following table sets forth our operating statistics for corporate hotels for the years ended december  and december  for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room average occupancy rate  which is determined by dividing the number of guestrooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of guestrooms available for the period  was for corporate hotels for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the occupancy rate for the year ended december  was positively influenced by the increase in occupancy experienced by those hotels that had completed or were near completion of their ramp up phase 
overall  the increase in occupancy was experienced in both short and long term stays  but was particularly strong in our long term stay business  which consists of travelers staying seven or more nights 
it is our practice to continuously review individual markets to assess the impact of competition on local supply and demand and establish room rates that balance occupancy to produce optimal revenue 
the average daily room rate for corporate hotels for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  average daily room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of guestrooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period 
the decrease in average daily rate was largely due to the increase in our long term stays  which are charged at a lower daily rate 
factors that influence average daily room rates include stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  higher rates for our one bedroom suites  and higher rates in certain hotel locations 
revenue per available room  calculated as the average occupancy rate multiplied by the average daily rate  was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   a increase 
we cannot predict whether current occupancy and room rates can be maintained 
future occupancy and room rates may be impacted by a number of factors including the number and geographic location of new hotels  the season in which new hotels open  competition  market acceptance of our hotels  and general economic conditions 
we consider a property to have generally completed its initial ramp up phase somewhere between nine and twelve months following a hotel s opening 
the ramp up phase is dependent on the supply demand characteristics of individual markets as well as the effectiveness of our local sales efforts 
we had corporate hotels open as of december   one of which opened in the following table sets forth the performance of our hotels  stratified by the year in which the hotels opened revenue per number of average daily available hotels occupancy rate room hotels hotels hotels hotels hotels total as of december   we had company operated hotels that had been open at least two years  representing of the total corporate hotels open as of december  we consider these hotels to have completed their ramp up phase 
the following table sets forth the performance of these hotels for the years ending december  and  respectively for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room the average occupancy rate for the hotels that had been open at least two years as of december  was in  compared to for this increase was due to the overall increase experienced in both short and long term stays during the year ended december   but more particularly  the strength experienced in our long term stay business 
the average daily room rate decreased to in  compared to  primarily due to the lower daily rates charged for long term stays 
revenue per available increased  or  for the hotels in  compared to  primarily due to the increase in the occupancy rate 
hotel operating expenses hotel operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  hotel operating expenses consist of all expenses directly applicable to the operation of the hotels  including corporate allocations for various operating  marketing and accounting functions 
the largest portion of hotel operating expenses consisted of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of hotel operating expenses was comprised of normal operating items  such as utilities  property taxes  insurance  supplies  promotional materials  maintenance items and similar expenses 
the increase in hotel operating expenses is largely due to the full year impact of the company owned hotels opened in and the one hotel opened in  the variable nature of certain hotel operating expenses eg  as occupancy increases  certain expenses such as housekeeping labor and supplies increase  increased wages and general economic price increases 
rent expense on leased hotels rent expense on the leased hotels for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in rent expense reflects the full year lease costs of the three hotels sold and leased back in january and the contingent rent expense incurred on certain properties

hotel opening costs opening costs are costs incurred prior to the opening of a hotel and include costs related to the hiring and training of hotel personnel  such as travel  compensation and relocation 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected early adoption of statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires opening costs to be expensed as incurred 
opening costs for the year ended december  totaled  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in opening costs was primarily the result of having opened fewer company owned hotels in hotel depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense applicable to hotel operations eg  building  furniture  fixtures and equipment for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to  was a result of the full year impact of the company owned hotels opened in and the one hotel opened in in addition  many of the newly opened company owned hotels are in higher priced  primary markets where building costs are higher 
for both and  depreciation and amortization expense does not reflect any expense for properties sold in the sale leaseback transactions 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from three to forty years 
corporate operations other income other income for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for other income consists primarily of royalty fees revenue based fees received over the life of the franchise agreement and franchise fees a one time fee received upon execution of a signed franchise agreement from franchised hotels  management fees received from managed hotels and equity income from joint venture hotels

franchise fee income including application and royalty fees for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  franchise application fee income in increased as a result of executing new franchise agreements during the year ended december   compared to franchise agreements for the year ended december  the growth in royalty fee income is due to the increase in the number of franchise hotels in operation  and the increased revenue generated by those franchise hotels that had completed or were near completion of their ramp up phase 
we had franchised hotels excluding the boston capital joint venture hotels open as of december   compared to at december  the six boston capital joint venture hotels classified as joint venture hotels in our property table are also candlewood franchise hotels that we manage 
as a result  we receive royalty fees  management fees  and equity income from these hotels 
all six of these hotels opened during the year management fee income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in management fee income was primarily due to the management fees received from the six boston capital joint venture hotels 
equity income from joint venture hotels for the year ended december  totaled  compared to an equity loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in equity income is was due to the profitability of the boston capital joint venture hotels

the largest portion of corporate operating expenses consisted of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of other corporate operating expenses was comprised of normal operating costs  such as office space lease  travel  utilities  advertising  professional fees and similar expenses 
the increase in was primarily due to the expansion of our franchise sales and service team 
this expansion began in the second quarter of and was completed in the third quarter of franchise sales personnel are paid sales commissions on new franchise agreements 
during the year  we executed new franchise agreements  compared to agreements in abandoned site costs there were no abandoned site costs recorded for the year ended december  we recorded million of abandoned site costs for the year ended december  abandoned site costs represent costs  such as acquisition  architectural and zoning costs  related to certain development sites that we have decided not to develop 
corporate depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization applicable to corporate operations for the year ended december   totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization reflects depreciation of leasehold improvements and furnishings and our financial system hardware  software and peripheral equipment 
depreciation expense is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from three to twenty years 
amortization expense for intangible assets eg  operating rights  trademarks is computed using the straight line method over a period of twenty years 
the slight increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects the full year depreciation of leasehold improvements and furnishings purchased in for the new corporate office and depreciation of the financial system hardware  software and peripheral equipment purchased in interest income and expense we earned million of interest income for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the temporary investment of cash provided by operations 
interest income for the year ended december  related to the short term investment of proceeds received from the series b preferred stock placement  the sale leaseback transaction and the temporary investment of cash provided by operations 
we had interest expense  net of capitalized interest  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was due to the increased level of debt  higher interest rates  and fewer projects under construction  which reduced the amount of interest capitalized

as of december   we had only eight hotels open or under construction and the additional capital contribution amount was estimated at approximately million 
as of march   boston capital and mass mutual had not required us to increase our capital contribution  although they may require us to do so in the future 
we are otherwise in compliance with the terms of the joint venture agreement 
we will continue to identify and evaluate potential joint venture sites with these partners 
in addition to the above  at december   we had one joint venture hotel under construction in east lansing  michigan 
the total estimated cost of construction for this hotel is million

we currently have borrowed a total of million from various credit institutions gmac and regional local banks and hilton hotels corporation doubletree in connection with the development of candlewood hotels 
the maturity dates for these loans range from february to march with interest rates which range from to on non doubletree loans million to a fixed on the doubletree loan million 
approximately million and million of the total debt matures in and  respectively 
we currently do not have sufficient cash available to pay off the principal amount of these loans 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements we have with these lenders except for hilton  each loan provides for an extension period 
we plan to evaluate each loan based on a number of factors including hotel performance  interest rate  secondary market considerations and corporate strategy to determine if we will seek an extension or refinancing 
for those loans which matured in february and march  we have paid down a portion of the principal and extended the loans for up to one year 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to extend or refinance any of our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in regards to the doubletree debt  the first installment of million matures in november we are in discussions with hilton to negotiate an extension on this debt 
as consideration for securing an extension  we may be required to pay down a portion of the debt at or prior to the original maturity date 
we are unable to assure that we will be able to extend the maturity date of the doubletree debt or that permanent financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  as of december   we have guaranteed approximately million of the construction debt on the boston capital joint venture properties 
maturity dates for this debt range from october to december this debt is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
dividend payments on the series a and series b preferred stock are paid quarterly and in preference to the common stock 
these payments are approximately million per quarter 
after payment of dividends on the series a and series b preferred stock  we intend to retain any future earnings for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business 
we believe that a combination of our cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  borrowed funds from third party lenders if approved on an individual basis and construction loan guarantees from doubletree will be sufficient to provide capital for development of projects currently under construction  payment of preferred dividends and operations through december we will be required to invoke contractual extensions or refinance much of the million of debt that will mature during in addition  from time to time we will consider strategic acquisitions as a means of growth  which would require additional capital 
we continue to consider a number of financing alternatives  including credit facilities  the issuance of equity  debt or equity linked securities and joint ventures  which are necessary to provide the capital needed to build or acquire additional hotels 
we are unable to assure that we will be able to obtain financing on a timely basis  on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  losses of deposits or other committed capital  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as of december   we have available million of net operating loss carryforwards which are available to be utilized in future years to offset taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as the majority of our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on prime and libor 
if interest rates change by 
percent  the market value of our mortgages and notes payable  based on the outstanding balance effected by libor at december   would change by approximately  additionally  we have market risk on our short term investments  which are considered cash equivalents  due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase by 
percent  the market value of our short term investments  based on the outstanding balance at december   would change by approximately  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  we are required to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
because of our minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company
