in june of the company received notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that it was subject to delisting by the nasdaq national market on september   unless anytime before september  the bid price of the company s common stock was at least for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
additionally  in august of the company received a second notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that it was subject to delisting by the nasdaq national market on november   unless anytime before november  the minimum market value of public float of the company s common stock was at least  for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
on september   the company announced that it had appealed the nasdaq delisting notice  and that  as part of its plan to regain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements and subject to nasdaq and shareholder approval  the board of directors had authorized a one for four reverse split of outstanding shares of common stock and had scheduled a special shareholders meeting on december  for shareholders of record as of november  to vote on these matters 
on october  the company presented to the nasdaq listing qualifications panel its plan to regain compliance for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  or alternatively  to be allowed to maintain a listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on october  the company received notice from the nasdaq listing qualifications panel that the listing of the company s securities would be transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market effective with the open of business on october  accordingly  on october   the company s securities started trading on the nasdaq smallcap market and the company s trading symbol was changed to wkgpc  signifying a conditional listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
after approval at a special meeting of stockholders on december   the company effected a one for four reverse stock split on december  as of that date  the company s trading symbol was changed to wkgcd  signifying not only the conditional listing  but also designating that these securities were the new one for four reverse split securities 
in january of the company received notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that it had met the terms of the exception granted by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel when wtc s listing was transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market on october  accordingly  effective january   the company s trading symbol was changed from wkgcd back to wkgp  which was its original nasdaq trading symbol 
there can be no assurance that the company s common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
delisting of the common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  the company s common stock 
also  if in the future the company determines that it needs to seek additional equity capital  it could have an adverse effect on its ability to raise capital in the public equity markets 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
because the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from software license fees  the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to the size  timing and shipment of individual orders  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or the lengthening of the sales cycle either generally or with respect to individual customers 
in addition  the company s growth is dependent on achieving broader market acceptance of its products  the growth of the product data management market and the ability of the company to introduce enhancements and additional integrations to its products in a timely manner to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
the company also relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the segment of the software industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are impacted by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing and shipment of enhancements to the company s products and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  an unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and stock price
