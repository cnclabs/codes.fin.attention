funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  an alternative measure of performance of an equity reit 
in october  nareit issued a new white paper statement and redefined how funds from operations is calculated  effective january  funds from operations is now defined by nareit as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus depreciation and amortization other than amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
non recurring items  other than those considered extraordinary under gaap  are no longer adjustments to funds from operations 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of consolidated historical operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the following tables represent the unaudited calculation of our consolidated quarterly summary of funds from operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  fourth third second first total quarter quarter quarter quarter net income loss available to common shareholders     ffo adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization      straight line rental revenue adjustments      straight line rental revenue from joint ventures amortization of costs for leases assumed joint venture adjustments  gain loss on sales of real estate    minority interests     extraordinary loss  cumulative effect of change in accounting principal   funds from operations  excluding straight line rental revenue     straight line rental revenue      straight line rental revenue from joint ventures funds from operations  including straight line rental revenue      other data net cash provided by operating activities      net cash used in provided by investing activities      net cash used in provided by financing activities      year ended december  fourth third second first total quarter quarter quarter quarter net income available to common shareholders      ffo adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization      straight line rental revenue adjustments   straight line rental revenue from joint ventures joint venture adjustment amortization of costs for leases assumed gain on sales of real estate    minority interests      extraordinary loss  funds from operations  excluding straight line rental revenue      straight line rental revenue   straight line rental revenue from joint ventures funds from operations  including straight line rental revenue      other data net cash provided by operating activities      net cash used in investing activities      net cash provided by financing activities      year ended december  fourth third second first total quarter quarter quarter quarter net income available to common shareholders      ffo adjustments real estate depreciation and amortization      straight line rental revenue adjustments  amortization of costs for leases assumed  minority interests      extraordinary loss  funds from operations  excluding straight line rental revenue      straight line rental revenue  funds from operations  including straight line rental revenue      other data net cash provided by operating activities     net cash used in investing activities      net cash provided by financing activities      during the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with sab effective january   we recorded a charge to income of  net of minority interests of  representing the cumulative effect of adopting sab as of january  pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  the previously reported quarterly information for the first three quarters of has been restated 
the net quarterly effect was a decrease in net income loss available to common shares of  and for the first and second quarters  respectively  and an increase of for the third quarter of  a decrease in funds from operations of and for the first and second quarters  respectively  and an increase in funds from operations of for the third quarter 
no restatement of or information was necessary 
included in the above four quarters revenue adjustments is   and  for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  of revenue previously recorded excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and non real estate related depreciation 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission the commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the commission s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we granted permanent property easements on portions of certain of our properties in for which we recorded all of the revenue in when the cash was received 
in addition  the services company previously recognized of leasing commissions at the time of lease signing 
however  half of the commission amounts are subject to the tenant occupying the space 
under sab  revenue should be recognized over the anticipated period that the easement would be used and lease commissions should be recognized when all conditions related to earning the commission have been settled 
we adopted sab retroactive to january  and recorded a charge to income of million  net of minority interests of million  representing the cumulative effect of adopting sab as of january  the cumulative effect represents income recognized in and relates to the permanent property easements and to leasing activity described above 
during  we recognized million of other income a portion of which is included in other property revenues in the consolidated statements of income previously recorded in the prior year 
although the adoption of sab may impact the period in which the services company and we recognize certain revenues  it is not expected to impact the timing of our cash flow from operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas was previously amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas and sfas effective january  sfas and sfas will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be recognized immediately in earnings 
upon adoption of sfas and sfas on january   we will record as a cumulative effect of an accounting change a net transition adjustment unrealized loss of million in net income  and a net transition adjustment of million as a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income at that time 
adoption of the standard will result in a net transition adjustment of million on the balance sheet reflected as a million reduction in deferred costs  a million reduction in investment in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and a deferred hedge liability recorded of million 
substantially all of our office and industrial leases require tenants to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office and industrial leases provide for fixed increases in base rent or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
as of december   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness was subject to interest at floating rates 
future indebtedness may also be subject to floating rate interest 
the floating rate debt includes million subject to an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively results in a fixed rate of  million subject to various interest rate cap agreements and million subject to an interest rate collar agreement 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on such indebtedness

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our mortgage notes payable and bonds payable  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  collars and caps  the table represents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

the cap effect of this collar agreement is effectively eliminated by the company s sale of an interest rate cap for a notional amount of million maturing on january  concurrent with the sale  the company entered into an interest rate cap for a notional amount of million which capped the interest rate at a libor index rate of 
based upon the rates in effect at december   the weighted average interest rates  including the interest rate swap  collar and cap agreements  on our mortgage notes payable and bonds payable at december  were and  respectively 
additionally  the bonds payable of million and million are collateralized by letters of credit of million and million  respectively  incurring annual fees of and quarterly extension fees  respectively 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt increased by one percentage point  our annual interest incurred including the effects of the interest rate protection agreements would increase by million
