the tender offer expired on march  and was oversubscribed 
we are currently calculating the proration factors and will close the tender offer shortly 
xerox also granted us an option to purchase up to  additional shares of our stock it owned after completion of the tender offer at the tender offer price so long as its ownership after the exercise of the option is at least of our outstanding common stock 
we currently expect to exercise the option to the extent required to reduce xerox s ownership to of our stock 
the purchase would be financed with a promissory note

 long term construction type contracts 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force domestically  and internationally through distributors and value added resellers  or vars 
revenues from export sales and sales through our foreign subsidiary were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to revenue from export sales were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily the result of increased revenues through our xerox affiliates in australia and europe 
the decrease from to is primarily the result of decreased activity associated with an internal realignment of our foreign subsidiary 
until september   we had a strategic marketing alliance with xerox under which both parties agreed to pay each other fees on referrals that lead to the successful sale or licensing of each other s products 
our revenues from this strategic marketing alliance were   and in  and  respectively 
these commissions were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
no commissions were paid relating to referrals from xerox in  and 
table of contents we have entered into distributorship agreements with various xerox foreign affiliates to remarket our products internationally 
our revenues from these agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily the result of increased revenues through our xerox affiliates in australia and europe 
the increase from to is primarily the result of increased revenues through our xerox affiliate in brazil 
initial license fees 
initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and a decrease of from to the decrease in was mainly the result of decreased revenues from our foreign resellers

initial license revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
annual renewal license and support fees 
annual renewal license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to these increases were principally due to an increase in the installed base of users of our software products 
annual license fees were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
services and other 
revenues from services and other were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to these decreases were principally due to the mix of software being sold  much of which did not require as much consulting services in order to be implemented 
revenues from services and other were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of initial license fees 
costs of initial license fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of initial license fees in  and  respectively 
cost of initial license fees includes documentation  reproduction costs  product packaging and media  employment costs for installation and distribution personnel  the cost of third party software and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in from was primarily the result of expensing the remainder of the capitalized software costs of visual compuset professional edition due to the th quarter release of visual compuset professional edition the decrease as a percentage of revenue in from was primarily due to savings realized from our restructuring 
cost of annual renewal license and support fees 
costs of annual license fees were   and million  and  respectively  representing  and of annual license fees in  and  respectively 
costs of annual renewal license fees consist principally of the employment related costs for our technical support staff

as a percentage of total revenue  research and 
table of contents development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to direct significant resources to the development and enhancement of our products 
we expense all costs for research and development of new products until technological feasibility has been assured 
thereafter  costs of software development are capitalized until general release of the product 
the capitalized costs of software development are amortized using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current product revenues to estimated total product revenues or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
we capitalized software development costs of   and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in is due to the release of two major products  visual compuset professional edition and dls and related components 
the amount of software development costs to be capitalized in the future may change if the time between the establishment of technological feasibility of a product and its general release changes 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related costs for pre and post sales activity 
the increase in was primarily due to increased marketing expenditures on advertising  promotion activities and trade shows

the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and higher professional fees 
the decrease in was the result of savings realized from our restructuring 
general and administrative expenses were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
restructuring charges 
in connection with a restructuring plan adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with our actions to reduce our overall cost structure that had become inconsistent with our revenue base 
this charge included the termination of employees  the write off of impaired assets and a reduction in our leased facilities 
interest  net 
interest  net is composed of interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments offset by finance charges related to equipment leases 
interest  net was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in is from higher cash balances 
the decrease in is from lower cash balances due to payments made toward the restructuring charges 
provision for income taxes 
effective tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
these rates differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances offsetting deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect future operating results our total revenues and operating results can vary  sometimes substantially  from quarter to quarter and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
future results will depend upon many factors  including the demand for our products  the level of product and price competition  the length of our sales cycle  the size and timing of individual license transactions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the budget cycles of our customers  our success in expanding our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the mix of products and services sold  levels of international sales  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  the timing of new hires  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to develop and market new products  controlling costs and general domestic and international 
table of contents economic conditions 
in addition  our sales generally reflect a relatively high amount of revenue per order  and  therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on our revenues and quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each fiscal quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
our software products generally are shipped as orders are received 
as a result  initial license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the timing of receipt of initial license fees is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  typically three to twelve months from the initial contact 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue trends and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from a limited number of initial license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses 
to the extent such expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
due to the foregoing factors  revenues and operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this is an increase of million from december   primarily representing cash generated from operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through the next twelve months 
as discussed above in overview and recent developments  our self tender offer for cash expired on march  we anticipate purchasing  shares at per share  which will reduce our cash balance by million to approximately million 
in addition  we may exercise our option to purchase additional shares from xerox which would be paid for with a promissory note 
a portion of our remaining cash could be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
we are currently evaluating  in our ordinary course of business  potential investments such as businesses  products or technologies 
we have no current understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies 
recently enacted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
the statement defers for one year the effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
now will apply to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
as of december   we do not hold any derivative instruments  or conduct any hedging activities 
therefore  we do not anticipate any impact to our consolidated financial statements for the adoption of sfas no 
and at january  in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying accounting practice board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb no 
states the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a 
table of contents previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin became effective on july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
euro conversion in january  a new currency called the euro was introduced in certain economic and monetary union  or emu  countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro will have on the marketplace 
additionally  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the european commission with regard to the euro 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined any potential costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies on non us based competitors 
the primary foreign currency risk exposure is related to us dollar to french franc and us dollar to euro conversions 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm sales commitments and anticipated sales for the next quarter and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual export sales during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the affect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects described above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
each month we review our position for expected currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
