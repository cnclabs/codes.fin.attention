overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary  high voltage  analog ics for use in ac to dc power conversion primarily for the cellular telephone  personal computer  cable and direct broadcast satellite and various consumer electronics markets 
from our inception in march through  we developed numerous standard and custom products incorporating high levels of features and functionality  each intended to address the needs of various markets 
although we succeeded in developing the core of our patented technology during this period  market penetration of our products was low because these products were not as cost effective as alternative products 
limited product revenue and the high costs associated with developing and marketing numerous solutions to numerous target markets resulted in our being unprofitable 
in  we changed our strategy to focus on bringing cost effective  integrated products to the high voltage ac to dc power supply markets 
as a result  in  we completed development of topswitch  the first in our family of cost effective  high voltage  power conversion ics 
the topswitch family of products  with its proprietary integrated architecture  is designed to address with relatively few products broad applications in a number of high volume  high voltage ac to dc power supply markets 
the initial target markets served by topswitch are particularly sensitive to size  portability  energy efficiency and time to market 
the topswitch products and the solutions enabled by them are significantly lower in cost than our previous products and the solutions enabled by those products 
commercial shipments of topswitch began in may primarily as a result of the increasing sales of topswitch products  our net revenues from product sales more than tripled between and  increasing from million to million 
net revenues from product sales increased sequentially by in  in  in  in and in in response to increasing market acceptance of our topswitch products and faster revenue growth in  we accelerated our investment in research and development and sales and marketing  including technical customer support 
as a result  operating expenses were million in  million in  million in  million in and million in we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues  as we continue to add resources to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative activities 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  are difficult to forecast and are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
for a discussion of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual operating results  please see factors that may affect future results of operations 
we license certain technologies and grant limited product manufacturing and marketing rights to strategic parties in return for foundry relationships  license fees and product royalty arrangements 
prior to the introduction of topswitch in  our analog ics generated limited product sales while license fees and prepaid royalties accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues 
in future periods  we expect license fees and royalties to consist primarily of royalties on products shipped by licensees incorporating licensed technology  and anticipate that license fees and royalties will account for a small percentage of net revenues 
a portion of our cost of revenues consists of the cost of wafers 
the contract prices to purchase wafers from matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 
from time to time  as these strategic parties close old production lines and move to new fabrication facilities  we must absorb a portion of the costs of physically moving the manufacturing of our products to new production lines  including the costs of installation of new process technologies 
product revenues consist of sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers are recognized upon shipment 
at that time  we provide for estimated sales returns and other allowances related to those sales 
between and percent of our sales are made to distributors under terms allowing certain rights of return and price protection for our products held in the distributors inventories 
therefore  we defer recognition of revenue and the proportionate cost of revenues derived from sales to distributors until the distributors sell our products to their customers 
the gross profit deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december  net revenues product sales license fees and royalties total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus license fees and royalties paid by licensees of our technology 
net revenues increased to million in compared to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenues from product sales was due primarily from our other end market category in which no one market represented more than of our net revenues 
sales to the cellular phone market  which is our largest end market  accounted for approximately of our net product revenues for compared to of net product revenues in sales of our topswitch and tinyswitch products represented and of net revenues from product sales in and  respectively 
net revenues from royalties were million in compared to million in we expect net revenues from royalties to continue to account for a small percentage of our net revenues 
international sales were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues in those respective periods 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  the largest portion of our net revenues is derived from sales to this region 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
in  two separate customers  both of whom are distributors  accounted for approximately and of net revenues 
in  the same customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues  gross profit 
gross profit is equal to net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from matsushita and oki  the assembly and packaging of our products  and internal labor and overhead associated with the testing of both wafers and packaged components 
these costs include expenses incurred in connection with the physical move of the manufacturing of our products between wafer production lines at our foundry suppliers and with the installation of new process technologies at these foundries 
these costs may recur from time to time and adversely affect our cost of revenues 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in compared to million  or of net revenues  in we continued to see some impact of increased pricing pressures to gross margins  and lost some manufacturing efficiencies due to new product introductions 
in  gross profit benefited from a one time credit from one of our wafer suppliers in the amount of million  which improved our gross profit by for that year 
we cannot assure you that our gross profit will remain at these levels in future periods 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until new products are released to production 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues in  compared to million  or of net revenues in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased salaries and other costs related to the hiring of additional engineering personnel  outside consulting fees and expensed prototype materials resulting from the transition of foundry manufacturing processes  and bringing newly developed products into manufacturing 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues in  compared to million  or of net revenues in this increase in absolute dollars represented the addition of personnel to support international sales and field application engineers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  outside services  legal and auditing expenses 
in and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively  which represented and of net revenues in each respective period 
the decrease in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to reduced professional and legal expenses related to the settlement in of the patent infringement lawsuit that we filed 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in other income reflected additional interest income related to the increase in cash equivalents and short term investments from to  and lower interest expense related to a reduction in our capital equipment lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for and represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for the increased tax rate in is primarily because the impact of benefiting net operating loss carry forwards ended in the difference between the statutory rate of and our effective tax rate for is due primarily to the favorable effects of research and development tax credits  foreign sales corporation and apportionment of state taxes  net of the federal benefit 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased to million in compared to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenues from product sales was due primarily to strong demand for our products across all of our major markets and geographies 
in particular  sales to the cellular phone market accounted for approximately of our product revenues for compared to of product revenues in  and increased over sales into that market 
sales of our topswitch and tinyswitch products represented and of net revenues from product sales in and  respectively 
net revenues from royalties were million in compared to million in international sales were million in compared to million in  representing approximately and of net revenues in those respective periods 
although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  the largest portion of our net revenues is derived from sales to this region 
in  two separate customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues 
in  the same customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues  gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in compared to million  or of net revenues in efficiencies realized from higher volumes  reductions in wafer costs  and improved test yields contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
gross profit also benefited from a one time credit from one of our wafer suppliers in the amount of million recorded in the credit improved our gross profit by for the year 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased salaries and other costs related to the hiring of additional engineering personnel  outside consulting fees and expensed prototype materials resulting from the transition of foundry manufacturing processes  and bringing newly developed products into manufacturing 
these expenses remained unchanged as a percentage of net revenues at in both and sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues in  compared to million  or of net revenues in this increase in absolute dollars represents the addition of personnel to support international sales and field application engineers 
general and administrative expenses 
in and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively  which represented and of net revenues in each respective period 
this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased professional and legal expenses related to a patent infringement lawsuit filed that we filed 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in other income reflected additional interest income related to the increase in cash equivalents and short term investments from to  and lower interest expense related to a reduction in our capital equipment lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for and represented federal  state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for the difference between the statutory rate and our effective tax rate for and is due to the impact of benefiting net operating loss carry forwards  offset by the reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance

 net revenues product sales license fees and royalties total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues increased sequentially in the first three quarters of and were essentially unchanged from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
net revenues decreased in the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of due to the seasonal nature of some of our markets  and then remained relatively flat for the balance of we did not experience historical seasonal increases in the third and fourth quarters of  due primarily to weakening of the cell phone market during that time 
our gross profit  as a percentage of net revenues  remained flat during the first three quarters of and was down in the fourth quarter due primarily to increased pricing pressures and some lost manufacturing efficiencies due to new product introductions 
the third quarter of benefited approximately from a one time credit from one of our wafer suppliers 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  generally increased during the eight quarters presented  primarily due to increased staffing in the areas of new product design and technology development 
sales and marketing expenses generally increased in absolute dollars over the first six quarters presented and then were down slightly in the third and fourth quarter of the increases were due primarily to the additional staffing in sales and application engineering and increased sales commissions due to the increased revenues from product sales 
sales expenses were down in the third and fourth quarters of due primarily to reduced commissions because of lower net revenues 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  remained relatively flat over the eight quarters presented except for a significant increase in the third quarter of due primarily to increased legal expenses related to a patent infringement lawsuit that we filed 
interest and other income  net  with the exception of the fourth quarter of  essentially increased over the eight quarters presented primarily from increased interest income due to higher cash balances created by a net positive cash flow 
other income  net was down in the fourth quarter of due to a one time write off of abandoned leasehold improvements connected with the move to our new facilities in that quarter 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering of common stock in december  our principal source of funding has been cash from our operations with some funding from capital equipment lease lines 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  under a revolving line of credit agreement with union bank of california  we can borrow up to million 
a portion of the credit line is used to cover advances for commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit  which we provide to matsushita and oki prior to the shipment of wafers by those foundries to us 
the balance of this credit line is unused and available 
the line of credit agreement contains financial covenants and requires that we maintain profitability on a quarterly basis and not pay or declare dividends without the bank s prior consent 
we have financed a significant portion of our machinery and equipment through capital equipment leases 
we financed additional equipment during the year ended december  in the amount of  with no additional financing in the year ended december  we may obtain additional financing for equipment purchases in future quarters 
as of december   we owed approximately million on our various capital equipment leases 
as of december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of approximately million  which was an increase of approximately over december  our operating activities generated cash of million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash generated in the year ended december  was principally the result of net income in the amount of million  depreciation and amortization and an increase in accrued liabilities 
this was partially offset by increases in deferred income taxes  inventory and prepaid expenses 
cash generated in the year ended december  was principally the result of net income of million  depreciation and amortization and an increase in accrued liabilities  offset by increases in deferred income taxes  accounts receivable and inventories 
our investing activities were a net transfer from short term investments to cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december   and a transfer from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments of million for the year ended december  we also purchased capital assets in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in purchases of capital assets in was primarily due to expenditures related to the purchase of tenant improvements on our new facilities in san jose 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  in june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amended or modified certain issues discussed in sfas no 
sfas no 
is also effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
and sfas no 
establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statements also require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
we have reviewed our revenue recognition policies and determined that we are in compliance with sab accordingly  there was no impact on our financial statements from adopting sab in the fourth quarter of factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business before purchasing shares of our stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  are difficult to forecast  are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
as a result  our quarterly operating results will likely fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that occurs  the price of our stock may decline 
some of the factors that could affect our operating results include the following 
the volume and timing of orders received from customers  
the volume and timing of orders placed by us with our foundries  
changes in product mix including the impact of new product introduction on existing products  
our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies on a timely basis  
the timing of investments in research and development and sales and marketing  
cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  and 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
our quarterly results may be subject to seasonality 
historically  our revenues are strongest in our third and fourth quarters  due to what we believe are seasonal factors attributed to the high volume consumer markets for the end products into which our ics are sold 
our revenues have then followed a pattern of being sequentially linear or somewhat down in the first and second quarters of the next year 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers and if they fail to place  or if they cancel or reschedule orders for our products  our operating results and business may suffer 
our business is characterized by short term customer orders and shipment schedules 
the ordering patterns of some of our existing large customers have been unpredictable in the past and we expect that customer ordering patterns will continue to be unpredictable in the future 
not only does the volume of units ordered by particular customers vary substantially from period to period  but also purchase orders received from particular customers often vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes 
in addition  customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
in the past we have experienced customer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control  and significant cancellations could occur again at any time 
intense competition in the high voltage power supply industry may lead to a decrease in the average selling price and reduced sales volume of our products  which may harm our business 
the high voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and characterized by significant price erosion 
our products face competition from alternative technologies  including traditional linear transformers and discrete switcher power supplies 
if the price of competing products decreases significantly  the cost effectiveness of our products will be adversely affected 
if power requirements for applications in which our products are currently utilized  including battery chargers for cellular telephones  drop below current power levels  these older alternative technologies can be used more cost effectively than our topswitch based switchers 
we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market 
we believe our failure to compete successfully in the high voltage power supply business  including our ability to introduce new products with higher average selling prices  would materially harm our operating results 
if demand for our products declines in the cellular phone battery charger and desktop personal computer stand by markets  our net revenues will decrease 
applications of our products in the cellular phone battery chargers and desktop personal computer  or pc  stand by markets have and will continue to account for the majority of our net revenues 
we expect that our net revenues and operating results will continue to be substantially dependent upon these markets for the foreseeable future 
the cellular phone and desktop pc markets can be highly cyclical and have been subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
any significant downturn in these markets could cause our net revenues to decline and the price of our stock to fall 
in addition  technological advances in these markets may reduce demand for our products 
because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy  we may incur substantial expenses before we generate significant revenues  if any 
our products are generally incorporated into a customer s products at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use our products  commonly referred to as design wins  which can often require us to expend significant research and development and sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success  often precede volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues 
if a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product  we may not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that product for many months or years 
our products must meet exacting specifications  and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products 
our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that our products must meet 
ics as complex as those we sell often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments 
we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
if defects and failures occur in our products  we could experience lost revenue  increased costs  including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would harm our operating results 
we depend on third party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products and if they fail to provide us sufficient wafers  our business will suffer 
we have supply arrangements for the production of wafers with matsushita and oki 
although certain aspects of our relationships with matsushita and oki are contractual  many important aspects of these relationships depend on their continued cooperation and  in many instances  their course of conduct deviates from the literal provisions of the contracts 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to work successfully with matsushita or oki in the future  that they will continue to provide us with sufficient capacity at their foundries to meet our needs  or that either of them will not seek an early termination of its wafer supply agreement with us 
we estimate that it would take to months from the time we identified an alternate manufacturing source before that source could produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields in sufficient quantities to meet our needs 
although we provide matsushita and oki with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity of the foundry in which they manufacture wafers for us 
an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause matsushita and oki to reduce capacity available to us 
matsushita and oki may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customers requirements 
any of these concessions could harm our business 
if our third party suppliers and independent subcontractors do not produce our wafers and assemble our finished products at acceptable yields  our net revenues may decline 
we depend on matsushita and oki to produce wafers  and independent subcontractors to assemble finished products  at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely manner 
the failure of matsushita or oki to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from selling our products to our customers and would likely cause a decline in our net revenues 
in addition  our ic assembly process requires our manufacturers to use a high voltage molding compound available from only one vendor  which is difficult to process 
this compound and its required processes  together with the other non standard materials and processes needed to assemble our products  require a more exacting level of process control than normally required for standard packages 
unavailability of the sole source compound or problems with the assembly process can materially adversely affect yields and cost to manufacture 
we cannot assure you that acceptable yields will be maintainable in the future 
matsushita has licenses to our technology  which it may use to our detriment 
our ability to take advantage of the potentially large japanese market for our products is largely dependent on matsushita and its ability to promote and deliver our products 
pursuant to our agreement with matsushita  matsushita has the right to manufacture and sell products using our technology to japanese companies worldwide and to subsidiaries of japanese companies located in asia 
although we receive royalties on matsushita s sales  these royalties are substantially lower than the gross profit we receive on direct sales 
we cannot assure you that matsushita will not use the technology rights we have granted it to develop or market competing products following any termination of its relationship with us or after termination of matsushita s royalty obligation to us 
our international sales activities subject us to substantial risks 
sales to customers outside of the united states account for a large portion of our net revenues 
these sales involve a number of risks to us  including 
potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  
tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and 
the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
our failure to adequately address these risks could reduce our international sales  which would materially adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
if our efforts to enhance existing products and introduce new products are not successful  we may not be able to generate demand for our products 
our success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ics for high voltage power conversion for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers 
if we fail to develop and sell new products in a timely manner  our net revenues could decline 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market demands as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
our or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would harm our business and may cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  customers may defer or return orders for existing products in response to the introduction of new products 
although we maintain reserves against returns  we cannot assure you that these reserves will be adequate 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our business and increase our expenses 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
most of our operations are located in california  although part of our inventory is stored and shipped from an overseas facility 
we currently have only limited backup generators for emergency alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay shipments of our products to customers  and could result in lost revenue  which could harm our business and results of operations 
if our products do not penetrate additional markets  our business will not grow as we predict 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to penetrate additional markets for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to overcome the marketing or technological challenges necessary to do so 
to the extent that a competitor penetrates additional markets before we do  or takes market share from us in our existing markets  our net revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
an economic downturn in the us could cause a decline in demand for our products 
the recent announcements of economic slowdown by major companies in some of the end markets we serve  indirectly through our customers  may indicate that there could be a slowdown in demand for some of our ics 
if our customers are not successful in maintaining high levels of demand for their products  their demand for our ics may decrease and adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  we could lose market share  incur costly litigation expenses or lose valuable assets 
our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  and know how  and to continue our technological innovation 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
from time to time we have received  and we may receive in the future  communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could cause us to lose market share and harm our business 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries in which our technology is or may in the future be licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of infringement of our intellectual property 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced systems applications engineers 
the competition for these employees is intense  particularly in silicon valley 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for these individuals or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  and we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on  any of our employees 
we have adopted anti takeover measures  which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
in february  our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against hostile takeover tactics 
the adoption of this plan was not in response to any proposal to acquire us  and the board is not aware of any such effort 
the existence of this plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors
