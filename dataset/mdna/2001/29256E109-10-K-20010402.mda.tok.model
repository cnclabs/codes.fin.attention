results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or compared to total sales of  for the year ended december  both international and us sales increased during the year 
international sales increased in the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  this was due to the rebuilding of the international sales force  primarily in japan  as well as the addition of sales forces in certain countries in the middle east and france 
in the united states  sales increased for the year when compared to the prior year 
while agents that were with encore for the entire year showed strong increases over the prior year s sales  encore was not as successful as it anticipated in increasing the number of sales agents or representatives actively selling encore products 
in an effort to focus the sales force on productive agents  there were a number of sales representatives whose agreements with encore were terminated during sales of reconstructive devices  knees  hips  and shoulders  each showed a significant increase in sales in when compared to knee sales increased over the prior year  hip sales increased over the prior year  and shoulder sales increased over the prior year 
this was a result of several agents showing stronger sales year over year and the introduction of revision hip products 
however  trauma sales showed an overall decrease of from the prior year 
this was primarily due to the fact that there had been a large order during for the japanese customer of the ultimax tm line of trauma products which was not repeated during spinal product sales increased to over  during the year of  which was a result of obtaining the necessary fda approvals for the scient x product lines during the first quarter of and beginning to sell the medicrea product lines during the second half of gross margin during was negatively impacted by two different items 
first  with the increased percentage of international sales  as compared to us sales  gross margin decreased because us sales generate a greater gross margin than sales outside the united states 
secondly  during the fourth quarter of  encore conducted an extensive evaluation of its product lines and decided to rationalize the products it was offering for sale 
as a result of this product rationalization  there was  of additional reserves added to the inventory reserve for slow moving  discontinued and obsolete items 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was when the inventory charge is included  and without the inventory charge 
this compares to a gross margin of of sales for selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or over a portion of this increase came from an increase of commission and royalty expenses related to higher sales 
additional increases in selling expenses related to a national sales meeting and surgeon meetings which had not been held in prior years 
research and development expenses increased by  over the amount spent in this represents an increase of 
significant activities undertaken during the year resulted in the keystone tm modular hip system being approved by the fda during  as well as a number of ide clinical studies being conducted 
additionally  several products are in the process of being developed 
an additional charge of  was taken in the fourth quarter of which relates to specific items that are not part of the normal selling  general and administrative  or research and development expenses 
the most significant was a charge of  related to impairment of intangible assets 
additional components of this charge include  which relates to post retirement obligations for former employees and  which relates to doubtful accounts connected to a french customer 
as a result of these other charges and the increase in the inventory reserve taken in  operating income showed a loss of  however  absent these charges  operating income would have been  this amount is  or less than operating income for interest expense increased by  in compared to this was due to a full year of interest expense related to the notes incurred in the acquisition of bti  whereas only nine months of interest expense was incurred during the year of related to these notes 
in addition  the average amount outstanding on the line of credit during was greater than the average amount outstanding during the total effect of the increase in sales  offset by the increase in expenses as well as the charges to inventory reserves and other charges outlined above resulted in emc having a net loss for the year of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or compared to total sales of  for the year ended december  this decrease in absolute sales reflects two different trends for encore sales 
on one hand  us sales increased over more productive sales territories  an increase in the number of sales territories and an increase in the number of products offered for sale fueled the increase in us sales 
on the other hand  outside the us  sales decreased compared to the year ended december  this was mainly due to the significant decrease in the sales of encore s former primary distributor for europe 
this relationship was changed in the summer of and encore became engaged in pursuing alternative avenues for international distribution to remedy this situation 
during encore entered into distribution agreements for france and the middle east and engaged in negotiations with other distributors for other countries in europe 
in addition  encore terminated its relationship with its distributor for total joint products in japan as of december  during  encore located and contracted with a new  highly experienced sales distribution company for carrying not only encore s total joint lines of products  but also its new trauma products that it acquired when it acquired the trauma specialty company bti 
this sales force will complement the other japanese sales force that is distributing encore s specialty trauma line of intramedullary rods and an external fixation system 
overall  while sales of reconstructive products decreased to  in  this decrease masks the significant increase in hip sales for encore 
these products were significantly aided by the addition of several new products that were introduced during and showed strong sales growth in the overall decrease in total joint sales was fueled by decreased sales of the foundation r total knee systems which were the only product being sold by encore s former european distributor 
another strong indication of the progress that encore made during is that trauma product sales increased over this increase was a result of having a broader product line  in part due to the acquisition of bti  and having the products gain more acceptance throughout the united states 
another factor in the increased us sales was the transition from a non exclusive to an exclusive sales force 
going forward  rapid geographical expansion in the united states  an improvement in the quality of the sales force  adding new international distributors who will carry the full encore product line and introduction of new products will fuel additional increases in sales in both the total joint and trauma segments of the business 
additionally  encore received several of the needed fda approvals to market spinal products during the later half of and was able to bring these products to the united states during as an indication of the fiscal management and cost control that encore exercised during  gross margin as a percent of sales increased in even though sales overall decreased 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales for this was due both to the increase in us sales  which generate a greater gross margin than sales outside the us  and continued monitoring of manufacturing costs 
even with a decrease in sales for  encore kept up its strong research and development program since it recognizes that new products are the lifeblood of expansion of an orthopedics company 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to in from in activities included a joint design effort with saint gobain desmarquest fine ceramics to develop a ceramic knee femoral component to address the issue of polyethylene wear in the knee  clinical trials for a ceramic ceramic hip system and a metal metal hip system  development of a mobile bearing knee  development of a revision hip system and regulatory submissions for spine 
part of controlling expenses in a year when sales decreased was that selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in when compared to the same period in while a part of this decrease came from lower commissions and royalties associated with the overall decrease in sales  significant portions of the savings came from management efforts undertaken in for example  the company incurred costs in relating to consigned inventory discrepancies 
discrepancy charges in were insignificant 
as a result of the fiscal management of encore during a year of decreasing sales  operating income as a percent of sales increased to as compared to of 
so even though sales decreased by  operating income only decreased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense increased by  in compared to this was due to an increase during in the average line of credit balance over the same period last year and the addition of interest on notes payable related to the acquisition of bti on march  other income increased  in due to licensing income and favorable foreign exchange gains 
the total effect of the decrease in sales coupled with the strong fiscal management of encore was that net income as a percent of sales increased to in from in in pure dollar terms  net income for the year ended december   decreased to  from  in capital expenditures encore has invested significantly over the past several years on building a state of the art  fully integrated orthopedic implant company 
these expenditures have included the investment in surgical instrumentation  machine tools to increase manufacturing capacity  computer hardware and software  and equipment required to support a growing organization 
over the last several years  encore has acquired machine tools primarily through capital leases 
encore has made significant investments in surgical instrumentation  as such instrumentation is necessary to implant encore reconstructive products 
also  the size of the sales force and the increases in the product lines have necessitated increases in the need for additional surgical instruments 
in the united states  these instruments are capitalized and depreciated 
they are used by the sales force to aid in sales 
internationally  these instruments are sold or leased to international customers 
the amounts of surgical instruments capitalized in  and were   and  respectively 
other capital expenditures during those periods were   and  respectively 
as a growing organization  encore has devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving its management information systems through additions of hardware and software 
in addition  during  encore dealt with yk issues 
the expenditures for these computer expansions and improvements were approximately  in   in and  in liquidity since its inception  the company has financed its operations through the sale of equity securities  borrowings and cash flow from operations 
the company has available to it a million revolving credit facility 
this facility will decrease during the year on a quarterly basis to million 
in addition  it has a number of financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the company had drawn approximately million 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
while the company s current forecast shows that the company will be able to meet the financial covenants during and will be able to keep the need for outstanding debt under the maximum ceilings for amounts outstanding  there is no assurance that the forecasts will prove accurate or that the bank s requirements will be able to be met 
in  addition  there is no assurance that another credit facility will be available as a replacement to the current facility 
there exists the possibility that emc will need to obtain additional equity financing  although there is no assurance as to the amount  availability or cost of such financing 
a distinguishing feature of the credit facility is that encore s cash management services are intermingled with it on a daily basis 
encore s bank accounts sweep funds to either reduce or increase the loan balance  as needed  and invests any excess funds if the loan balance equals zero  in a money market account 
as such  the outstanding loan balance is adjusted daily based on the net amount of cash receipts versus cash outlays  while the cash balance at wells fargo remains at zero as long as encore is a net borrower 
this sweep feature has the effect of minimizing interest cost and automatically investing any excess funds 
the company s continued growth has resulted in an increase in its capital requirements 
this growth is now primarily funded by the credit facility and cash generated from operations to meet its working capital needs 
as of december   the company had net working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  this increase was primarily due to increases in inventory and accounts receivable  offset by an increase in the current portion of long term debt 
during the third quarter of and continuing through and into  emc began actively purchasing its equity securities  both common stock and warrants  in connection with the buyback program it announced at the beginning of this program was initiated because emc management and the board of directors felt that emc s equity was undervalued 
emc repurchased   and  shares of common stock in  and respectively  and  and  warrants during and  respectively 
emc did not repurchase any warrants during forward looking statements the foregoing management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that represent emc s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  statements regarding growth in sales of encore s products  profit margins and the sufficiency of emc s cash flow for its future liquidity and capital resource needs 
these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  the effect of competitive pricing  encore s dependence on the ability of its third party manufacturers to produce components on a basis that is cost effective to encore  market acceptance of encore s products  the ability to attract and retain competent employees  technological obsolescence of one or more products  changes in product strategies  the availability to locate acceptable acquisition candidates and then finance and integrate those acquisitions  and effects of government regulation 
results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results included in these statements as a result of these or other factors
