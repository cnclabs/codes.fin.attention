risk factors relating to brooks industry the cyclical demand of semiconductor manufacturers affects brooks operating results and the ongoing downturn in the industry could seriously harm brooks operating results 
brooks business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the level of semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditures is dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a downturn 
brooks anticipates the downturn will continue during the next few quarters 
despite these industry conditions  brooks plans to continue to invest in those areas which brooks believes are important to its long term growth  such as its infrastructure and information technology system  customer support  supply chain management and new products 
as a result  consistent with its experience in downturns in the past  brooks believes the current industry downturn will lead to reduced revenues for it and may cause it to incur losses 
industry consolidation and outsourcing of the manufacture of semiconductors to foundries could reduce the number of available customers 
the substantial expense of building or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is leading increasing numbers of semiconductor companies to contract with foundries  which manufacture semiconductors designed by others 
as manufacturing is shifted to foundries  the number of brooks potential customers could decrease  which would increase its dependence on its remaining customers 
recently  consolidation within the semiconductor manufacturing industry has increased 
if semiconductor manufacturing is consolidated into a small number of foundries and other large companies  brooks failure to win any significant bid to supply equipment to those customers could seriously harm its reputation and materially and adversely affect its revenue and operating results 
risk factors relating to brooks operations brooks sales volume substantially depends on the sales volume of brooks original equipment manufacturer customers and on investment in major capital expansion programs  retrofits and upgrades by end user semiconductor manufacturing companies 
brooks sells a majority of its tool automation products to original equipment manufacturers that incorporate brooks products into their equipment 
therefore  brooks revenues depend on the ability of these customers to develop  market and sell their equipment in a timely  cost effective manner 
brooks also generates significant revenues from large orders from semiconductor manufacturing companies that build new plants or invest in major automation retrofits and upgrades 
brooks revenues depend  in part  on continued capital investment by semiconductor manufacturing companies 
brooks relies on a relatively limited number of customers for a large portion of its revenues and business 
brooks receives a significant portion of its revenues in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers  or a decrease in orders by one or more customers  could adversely affect brooks revenue  business and reputation 
sales to brooks ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal delays in or cancellation of shipments of a few of brooks large orders could substantially decrease its revenues or reduce its stock price 
historically  a substantial portion of brooks quarterly and annual revenues has come from sales of a small number of large orders 
some of brooks products have high selling prices compared to brooks other products 
as a result  the timing of when brooks recognizes revenue from one of these large orders can have a significant impact on its total revenues and operating results for a particular period and reduce its stock price because its sales in that fiscal period could fall significantly below the expectations of financial analysts and investors 
this could cause the value of its common stock to fall 
brooks operating results could be harmed if a small number of large orders are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled due to delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance 
demand for brooks products fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably  which makes it difficult to manage its business efficiently and can reduce its gross margins and profitability 
brooks expense levels are based in part on its expectations for future demand 
many expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
the rapid and unpredictable shifts in demand for brooks products make it difficult to plan manufacturing capacity and business operations efficiently 
if demand is significantly below expectations  brooks may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs  which can diminish gross margins and cause losses 
a sudden downturn may also leave brooks with excess inventory  which may be rendered obsolete as products evolve during the downturn and demand shifts to newer products 
brooks ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because it must continue to invest in research and development to maintain its competitive position and to maintain service and support for its existing global customer base 
conversely  in sudden upturns  brooks sometimes incurs significant expenses to rapidly expedite delivery of components  procure scarce components and outsource additional manufacturing processes 
these expenses could reduce its gross margins and overall profitability 
any of these results could seriously harm brooks business 
brooks lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that brooks will generate revenue 
brooks tool automation products are generally incorporated into original equipment manufacturer equipment at the design stage 
to obtain new business from its original equipment manufacturer customers  brooks must develop products for selection by a potential customer at the design stage 
this often requires brooks to make significant expenditures without any assurance of success 
the original equipment manufacturer s design decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
brooks cannot guarantee that the equipment manufactured by its original equipment manufacturing customers will be commercially successful 
if brooks or its original equipment manufacturing customers fails to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner  brooks business and financial results will suffer 
brooks also must complete successfully a costly evaluation and proposal process before brooks can achieve volume sales of brooks factory automation software to customers 
these undertakings are major decisions for most prospective customers and typically involve significant capital commitments and lengthy evaluation and approval processes 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will continue to satisfy evaluations by its end user customers 
brooks operating results would be harmed if one of its key suppliers fails to deliver components for brooks products 
brooks currently obtains many of its components on an as needed  purchase order basis 
generally  brooks does not have any long term supply contracts with its vendors and believes many of its vendors have been taking cost containment measures in response to the industry downturn 
when demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment increases  brooks suppliers face significant challenges in delivering components on a timely basis 
brooks inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in significant delays or reductions in product shipments 
this could create customer dissatisfaction  cause lost revenue and otherwise materially and adversely affect brooks operating results 
delays on brooks part could also cause it to incur contractual penalties for late delivery 
brooks may experience delays and technical difficulties in new product introductions and manufacturing  which can adversely affect its revenues  gross margins and net income 
because brooks systems are complex  there can be a significant lag between the time brooks introduces a system and the time it begins to produce that system in volume 
as technology in the semiconductor industry becomes more sophisticated  brooks is finding it increasingly difficult to design and integrate complex technologies into its systems  to procure adequate supplies of specialized components  to train its technical and manufacturing personnel and to make timely transitions to high volume manufacturing 
many customers also require customized systems  which compound these difficulties 
brooks sometimes incurs substantial unanticipated costs to ensure that its new products function properly and reliably early in their life cycle 
these costs could include greater than expected installation and support costs or increased materials costs as a result of expedited changes 
brooks may not be able to pass these costs on to its customers 
in addition  brooks has experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulties in both low and high volume manufacturing 
any of these results could seriously harm brooks business 
moreover  on occasion brooks has failed to meet its customers delivery or performance criteria  and as a result brooks incurred late delivery penalties and had higher warranty and service costs 
these failures could continue and could also cause brooks to lose business from those customers and suffer long term damage to its reputation 
brooks may be unable to recruit and retain necessary personnel because of intense competition for highly skilled personnel 
brooks needs to retain a substantial number of employees with technical backgrounds for both its hardware and software engineering  manufacturing  sales and support staffs 
the market for these employees is intensively competitive  and brooks has occasionally experienced delays in hiring qualified personnel 
due to the cyclical nature of the demand for its products and the current downturn in the semiconductor market  brooks recently reduced its workforce as a cost reduction measure 
if the semiconductor market experiences an upturn  brooks may need to rebuild its workforce 
due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which brooks operates  this type of employment cycle increases brooks risk of being unable to retain and recruit key personnel 
brooks inability to recruit  retain and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect its ability to develop  manufacture  install and support its products and may result in lost revenue and market share if customers seek alternative solutions 
brooks international business operations expose it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately of brooks total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal brooks anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues 
many of brooks vendors are located in foreign countries 
as a result of its international business operations  brooks is subject to various risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  difficulties in managing distributors  representatives and third party systems integrators  challenges presented by collecting trade accounts receivable in foreign jurisdictions  longer sales cycles  possible adverse tax consequences  fewer legal protections for intellectual property  governmental currency controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  and export import controls and tariff regulations 
to support its international customers  brooks maintains locations in several countries  including belgium  canada  china  germany  japan  malaysia  singapore  south korea  switzerland  taiwan and the united kingdom 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will be able to manage these operations effectively 
brooks cannot assure you that its investment in these international operations will enable it to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of its customers  some of whom are located in countries where brooks has no infrastructure 
although brooks international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates can make it more difficult for brooks to compete with foreign manufacturers on price 
if brooks international sales increase relative to its total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on brooks operating results 
brooks must continually improve its technology to remain competitive 
technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
brooks believes its success depends in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer needs  even in industry downturns 
for example  as the semiconductor industry transitions from mm manufacturing technology to mm technology  brooks believes it is important to its future success to develop and sell new products that are compatible with mm technology 
if competitors introduce new technologies or new products  brooks sales could decline and its existing products could lose market acceptance 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will identify and adjust to changing market conditions or succeed in introducing commercially rewarding products or product enhancements 
the success of brooks product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurately identifying and defining new market opportunities and products  completing and introducing new product designs in a timely manner  market acceptance of brooks products and its customers products  timely and efficient software development  testing and process  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance in the field  development of a comprehensive  integrated product strategy  and efficient implementation and installation and technical support services 
because brooks must commit resources to product development well in advance of sales  its product development decisions must anticipate technological advances by leading semiconductor manufacturers 
brooks may not succeed in that effort 
its inability to select  develop  manufacture and market new products or enhance its existing products could cause it to lose its competitive position and could seriously harm its business 
brooks faces significant competition which could result in decreased demand for brooks products or services 
the markets for brooks products are intensely competitive 
brooks may be unable to compete successfully 
brooks believes the primary competitive factors in the tool automation systems segment are throughput  reliability  contamination control  accuracy and price performance 
brooks believes that its primary competition in the tool automation market is from integrated original equipment manufacturers that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs internally rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier like brooks 
many of these original equipment manufacturers have substantially greater resources than brooks does 
applied materials  inc  the leading process equipment original equipment manufacturer  develops and manufactures its own central wafer handling systems and modules 
brooks may not be successful in selling its products to original equipment manufacturers that internally satisfy their wafer or substrate handling needs  regardless of the performance or the price of brooks products 
moreover  integrated original equipment manufacturers may begin to commercialize their handling capabilities and become brooks competitors 
brooks believes that the primary competitive factors in the end user semiconductor manufacturer market for factory automation and process control solutions are product functionality  price performance  ease of use  ease of integration and installation  hardware and software platform compatibility  costs to support and maintain  vendor reputation and financial stability 
the relative importance of these competitive factors may change over time 
brooks directly competes in this market with various competitors  including applied materials consilium  ibm  si view  compaq  trw  camstar and numerous small  independent software companies 
brooks also competes with the in house software staffs of semiconductor manufacturers like nec  texas instruments and intel 
most of those manufacturers have substantially greater resources than brooks does 
brooks believes that the primary competitive factors in the factory interface market are technical and technological capabilities  reliability  price performance  ease of integration and global sales and support capability 
in this market  brooks competes directly with asyst  rorze  fortrend  newport  tok  yasakawa and hirata 
some of these competitors have substantial financial resources and extensive engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
much of brooks success and value lies in its ownership and use of intellectual property  and brooks failure to protect that property could adversely affect its future operations 
brooks ability to compete is heavily affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property 
brooks relies primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
the steps brooks has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
brooks patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which brooks products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect brooks products 
this may make the possibility of piracy of brooks technology and products more likely 
brooks cannot guarantee that the steps brooks has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating brooks proprietary rights 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
brooks may engage in litigation to enforce its patents  protect its trade secrets or know how  defend itself against claims alleging it infringes the rights of others  or determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to brooks and divert the attention of brooks management  which could harm its operating results and its future operations 
a party making such a claim could secure a judgment against brooks that requires it to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent brooks from selling its products 
any of these events could seriously harm brooks business 
brooks operations could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of brooks technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to brooks business 
brooks cannot predict the extent to which it may be required to seek licenses or alter its products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
brooks cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses it may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing brooks products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical or could detract from the value of its products 
brooks business may be harmed by infringement claims of general signal or applied materials 
brooks received notice from general signal corporation alleging certain of brooks products infringed its patent rights 
the notification advised brooks that general signal was attempting to enforce its rights to those patents in litigation against applied materials  and that  at the conclusion of that litigation  general signal intended to enforce its rights against us and others 
according to a press release issued by applied materials in november  applied materials settled its litigation with general signal by acquiring ownership of five general signal patents 
although not verified by brooks  these five patents would appear to be the patents referred to by general signal in its prior notice to brooks 
applied materials has not contacted brooks regarding these patents 
brooks does not have long term contracts with its customers and brooks customers may cease purchasing brooks products at any time 
brooks generally does not have long term contracts with its customers 
as a result  brooks agreements with its customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly brooks customers can cease purchasing its products at any time without penalty  brooks customers are free to purchase products from brooks competitors  brooks is exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and brooks customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
brooks software products may contain errors or defects that could result in lost revenue  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims with substantial litigation costs 
complex software products like brooks can contain errors or defects  particularly when brooks first introduces new products or when it releases new versions or enhancements 
any defects or errors could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance  which would seriously harm brooks business and operating results 
brooks has occasionally discovered software errors in its new software products and new releases after their introduction  and brooks expects that this will continue 
despite internal testing and testing by current and potential customers  brooks current and future products may contain serious defects 
because many of brooks customers use their products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to brooks customers and could significantly impair their operations 
brooks customers could seek to recover damages from brooks for losses related to any these issues 
a product liability claim brought against brooks  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect brooks marketing efforts 
brooks future operations could be harmed if the commercial adoption of mm wafer technology continues to progress slowly or is halted 
brooks future operations depend in part on the adoption of new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the industry transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is occurring more slowly than expected 
a significant delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology  or the failure of the industry to adopt mm manufacturing technology  could significantly impair brooks operations 
moreover  continued delay in transition to mm technology could permit brooks competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products at more competitive prices 
as a result of these factors  competition for mm orders could become vigorous and could harm brooks results of operations 
brooks recent rapid growth is straining its operations and requiring it to incur costs to upgrade its infrastructure 
during fiscal and  brooks experienced extremely rapid growth in its operations  its product offerings and the geographic area of its operations 
the proposed merger with pri will continue this trend 
brooks growth has placed a significant strain on its management  operations and financial systems 
brooks future operating results will depend in part on its ability to continue to implement and improve its operating and financial controls and management information systems 
if brooks fails to manage its growth effectively  its financial condition  results of operations and business could be harmed 
brooks systems integration services business has grown significantly recently and poor execution of those services could adversely impact brooks operating results 
the number of projects brooks is pursuing for its systems integration services business has grown significantly recently 
this business consists of integrating combinations of brooks software and hardware products to provide more comprehensive solutions for brooks end user customers 
the delivery of these services typically is complex  requiring that brooks coordinate personnel with varying technical backgrounds in performing substantial amounts of services in accordance with timetables 
brooks is in the early stages of developing this business and it is subject to the risks attendant to entering a business in which it has limited direct experience 
in addition  brooks ability to supply these services and increase its revenues is limited by its ability to retain  hire and train systems integration personnel 
brooks believes that there is significant competition for personnel with the advanced skills and technical knowledge that it needs 
some of brooks competitors may have greater resources to hire personnel with those skills and knowledge 
brooks operating margins could be adversely impacted if it does not effectively hire and train additional personnel or deliver systems integration services to its customers on a satisfactory and timely basis consistent with its budgets 
the effect of terrorist threats on the general economy could decrease brooks revenues 
on september   the united states was subject to terrorist attacks at the world trade center buildings in new york city and the pentagon in washington  dc the potential near and long term impact these attacks may have in regards to brooks suppliers and customers  markets for their products and the us economy are uncertain 
there may be other potential adverse effects on brooks operating results due to this significant event that brooks cannot foresee 
brooks business may be harmed by infringement claims of asyst technologies  inc 
brooks acquired certain assets  including a transport system known as iridnet  from the infab division of jenoptik ag on september  asyst technologies  inc had previously filed suit against jenoptik ag and other parties collectively  the defendants  claiming that products of the defendants  including iridnet  infringe asyst s patents 
this ongoing litigation may ultimately affect certain products sold by brooks 
brooks has received notice that asyst may amend its complaint to name brooks as an additional defendant 
based on brooks investigation of asyst s allegations  brooks does not believe it is infringing any claims of asyst s patents 
brooks intends to continue to support jenoptik to argue vigorously  among other things  the position that the iridnet system does not infringe the asyst patents 
if asyst prevails in prosecuting its case  asyst may seek to prohibit brooks from developing  marketing and using the iridnet product without a license 
because patent litigation can be extremely expensive  time consuming  and its outcome uncertain  brooks may seek to obtain licenses to the disputed patents 
brooks cannot guarantee that licenses will be available to it on reasonable terms  if at all 
if a license from asyst is not available  brooks could be forced to incur substantial costs to reengineer the iridnet product  which could diminish its value 
in any case  brooks may face litigation with asyst 
such litigation could be costly and would divert brooks management s attention and resources 
in addition  if brooks does not prevail in such litigation  brooks could be forced to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement 
jenoptik has indemnified brooks for losses brooks may incur in this action 
risk factors relating to brooks acquisitions brooks has announced a merger with pri  and uncertainty regarding the merger may disrupt brooks operations and adversely affect its business 
on october   brooks announced its proposed merger with pri automation  inc brooks cannot guarantee that the merger will occur 
the merger will happen only if stated conditions are met  including approval of the issuance of shares in the merger by brooks stockholders  approval of the merger by pri s stockholders  clearance of the merger under united states and foreign antitrust laws  and the absence of any material adverse change in the business of brooks or pri 
many of the conditions are outside the control of brooks and pri  and both parties also have stated rights to terminate the merger agreement 
accordingly  there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger 
this uncertainty may cause customers  suppliers and channel partners to delay or defer decisions concerning brooks  which could negatively affect its business 
customers  suppliers and channel partners may also seek to change existing agreements with brooks as a result of the merger 
any delay or deferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have a material adverse effect on brooks business  regardless of whether the merger is ultimately completed 
many costs related to the merger  such as legal  accounting  financial advisor and financial printing fees  must be paid by brooks regardless of whether the merger is completed 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  brooks may be subject to a number of risks  including a decline in the market price of brooks common stock  to the extent that the relevant current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed  and substantial disruption to brooks business and distraction of its workforce and management team 
in addition  employees who are uncertain about their future with the combined company or who do not wish to work for the combined company may seek employment elsewhere  which could impair brooks ability to operate its business 
brooks business could be harmed if brooks fails to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses it has acquired 
brooks has completed a number of acquisitions in a short period of time 
brooks management must devote substantial time and resources to the integration of the operations of its acquired businesses with its core businesses and with each other 
if brooks fails to accomplish this integration efficiently  brooks may not realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  research and development initiatives  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of the operation of its acquired businesses  presents a significant challenge to brooks management 
this is compounded by the challenge of simultaneously managing a larger entity 
these businesses have operations and personnel located in asia  europe and the united states and present a number of additional difficulties of integration  including assimilating products and designs into integrated solutions  informing customers  suppliers and distributors of the effects of the acquisitions and integrating them into brooks overall operations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and cultures  defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  managing geographically remote units  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which brooks has limited or no direct experience  and minimizing the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
if brooks delays the integration or fails to integrate an acquired business or experiences other unforeseen difficulties  the integration process may require a disproportionate amount of brooks management s attention and financial and other resources 
brooks failure to adequately address these difficulties could harm its business and financial results 
brooks business may be harmed by acquisitions brooks completes in the future 
brooks plans to continue to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
brooks identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on brooks business  diversion of brooks management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
if brooks is successful in pursuing future acquisitions  brooks may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect brooks results of operations and be dilutive to its stockholders 
if brooks spends significant funds or incurs additional debt  brooks ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline  and brooks may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
brooks cannot guarantee that it will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that it will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that brooks completes 
should brooks successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into brooks existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of brooks existing businesses 
risk factors relating to brooks common stock brooks operating results fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact its business and its stock price 
brooks revenues  margins and other operating results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including the level of demand for semiconductors in general  cycles in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and automation software  the timing  rescheduling  cancellation and size of orders from brooks customer base  brooks ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  brooks success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of brooks new product announcements and releases and those of its competitors  the mix of products it sells  the timing of any acquisitions and related costs  competitive pricing pressures  and the level of automation required in fab extensions  upgrades and new facilities 
brooks entered the factory automation software business in fiscal brooks believes a substantial portion of its revenues from this business will depend on achieving project milestones 
as a result  brooks revenue from this business will be subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors  including whether brooks can achieve project milestones on a timely basis  if at all  as well as the timing and size of projects 
brooks stock price is volatile 
the market price of brooks common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between april  and april   the closing price of brooks common stock rose from approximately to per share and between august  and september   the price of brooks common stock dropped from approximately to per share 
consequently  the current market price of brooks common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and brooks may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in its common stock 
factors affecting brooks stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or brooks failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of brooks public company customers  market conditions in the industry  general economic conditions  low trading volume of brooks common stock  and the number of firms making a market in brooks common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like brooks 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of brooks common stock 
because a limited number of stockholders  including a member of brooks management team  owns a substantial number of shares of brooks common stock and are parties to voting agreements  their decisions may be detrimental to your interests 
by virtue of their stock ownership and voting agreements  robert j 
therrien  brooks president and chief executive officer  and jenoptik ag have the power to significantly influence brooks affairs and are able to influence the outcome of matters required to be submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election of brooks directors  amendments to brooks certificate of incorporation  mergers  sales of assets and other acquisitions or sales 
these stockholders may exercise their influence over brooks in a manner detrimental to your interests 
as of december   mr 
therrien and m w zander holding gmbh  a subsidiary of jenoptik ag  beneficially owned approximately of brooks common stock 
brooks has a stockholders agreement with mr 
therrien  m w zander holding gmbh and jenoptik ag under which m w zander holding gmbh agreed to vote all of its shares on all matters in accordance with the recommendation of a majority of brooks board of directors 
provisions of brooks certificate of incorporation  bylaws  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due may discourage takeover offers and may limit the price investors would be willing to pay for brooks common stock 
brooks certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make an acquisition of brooks more difficult and discourage changes in brooks management 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of brooks common stock 
in addition  brooks has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under the plan become exercisable to purchase brooks common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of brooks common stock 
because of its possible dilutive effect to a potential acquirer  the rights plan would generally discourage third parties from proposing a merger with or initiating a tender offer for us that is not approved by brooks board of directors 
accordingly  the rights plan could have an adverse impact on brooks stockholders who might want to vote in favor of a merger or participate in a tender offer 
in addition  brooks may issue shares of preferred stock upon terms the board of directors deems appropriate without stockholder approval 
brooks ability to issue preferred stock in such a manner could enable its board of directors to prevent changes in its management or control 
finally  upon a change of control of brooks  brooks may be required to repurchase convertible subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal outstanding amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of the repurchase 
such a repurchase of the notes would represent a substantial expense  accordingly  the repayment of the notes upon a change of control of brooks could discourage third parties from proposing a merger with  initiating a tender offer for or otherwise attempting to gain control of brooks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on brooks overall interest exposure at september   including all interest rate sensitive instruments  a near term change in interest rates within a confidence level based on historical interest rate movements would not materially affect the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
currency rate exposure brooks foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of brooks international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of brooks international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments do not impact operating results  but instead are reflected as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent brooks expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  brooks will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation
