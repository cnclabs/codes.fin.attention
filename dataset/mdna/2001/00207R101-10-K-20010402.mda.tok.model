item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview atmi is a leading supplier of materials  equipment and related services used worldwide in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
atmi specifically targets the front end semiconductor materials market 
this market includes the processes used to convert a bare silicon wafer into a fully functional wafer that contains many copies of a semiconductor device or chip 
atmi s customers include most of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
atmi has organized its operations along two business segments materials and technologies 
the materials segment materials provides products that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process and related packaging and delivery systems 
the technologies segment technologies provides products and services that sense and environmentally control these materials while also providing specialized thin film deposition and outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services to semiconductor device manufacturers 
technologies also conducts the company s venture and government funded research and development activities 
the semiconductor equipment industry is inherently cyclical 
the company s equipment product lines are specifically tied to the semiconductor capital spending cycles  which causes significant volatility in order and revenue patterns for those products 
periods of robust capacity expansion are normally followed by periods of capacity digestion when equipment spending slows and existing capacity progresses towards full utilization 
following a strong period of capital spending in  the current outlook for is a decline in capacity expansion within the industry followed by recovery in late or early this will have a negative impact on the capital spending within the industry during and atmi s equipment product lines will be affected by that trend 
the majority of atmi s material product lines are driven by end use demand for semiconductors  or how many devices are made  rather than the capacity needed to make them 
as such  these product lines are less cyclical 
however  in there appears to be a softening in general macroeconomic conditions  causing a reduced growth in demand for end use devices 
this general condition could have an impact on the growth rate of atmi s consumable product lines in atmi has completed eight acquisitions during the three years ended december   seven of which have been accounted for as pooling of interests 
as a result  the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the results of these seven acquired companies 
the acquisition of the minority interest of its adcs korea joint venture was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative merger costs and related expenses total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income segment data the company has two reportable operating segments materials and technologies 
the reportable operating segments are each managed separately because they manufacture and distribute distinct products with different production processes 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on segment operating profit or loss  excluding merger costs and related expenses  interest  other income or expense  and income taxes 
the accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the company s consolidated financial statements 
intercompany sales are not material among segments or operating divisions 
the following tables provide reported results for each of these segments for the periods indicated in thousands fiscal year ended december  revenues materials    technologies    consolidated revenues    operating income materials    technologies    merger costs and related expenses    consolidated operating income    comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the continued growth of the semiconductor industry during this time period  as well as increased market penetration and the introduction of new products 
materials revenues increased in from levels  mainly as a result of increased market penetration of gas delivery systems  and volume gains in materials  liquid delivery systems and high purity packaging product lines 
technologies revenues increased in from levels  led by significant growth in thin film deposition services  the environmental and sensing product lines  and atmi s emosyn business 
the growth in sales between and was due in large part to the recovery of the semiconductor industry from a cyclical downturn experienced in  particularly for consumable products  as seen by materials growth in revenue 
materials experienced significant gains related to the materials and delivery systems product lines and high purity packaging product lines in as compared to technologies revenues for increased from levels 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity expansion began to rebound in the middle of leading to improved sales of environmental and sensing products and thin film deposition services 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from in gross margin decreased slightly to in from in the decrease was due in large part to factors within the technologies segment end of year softness in the environmental sensing and abatement equipment product lines  manufacturing inefficiencies in thin film deposition services due to the addition and continued ramp up of manufacturing capacity to support growth  and a higher percentage of total revenues generated by the emosyn business  which operates at lower margins than other atmi businesses and product lines 
partially offsetting these declines were favorable product mix shifts in the high purity packaging product lines  and materials and delivery systems in the materials segment 
gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in this increase was due principally to margin growth related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased sales and a shift in product mix towards materials and delivery systems  high purity packaging and liquid materials product lines 
research and development expenses

the merger related costs also included a million reversal of previously accrued merger costs for prior acquisitions 
the acquisition of delatech also resulted in a million asset impairment charge during the second quarter of for inventory million and goodwill million associated with an existing environmental equipment product line which was determined to be impaired 
the operating results included merger and related costs of million incurred in connection with the acquisition of now technologies 
operating income 
operating income  including the recognition of merger and related costs  increased almost four fold to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased to in compared to in the revenue growth experienced in drove considerable operating income increases 
operating income  including the recognition of merger and related costs  increased in to million from million in materials operating income increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by increased market penetration of gas delivery systems  volume gains in materials  liquid delivery systems and high purity packaging product lines  and improved leveraging of materials fixed overhead structure 
materials operating income for increased to million from million in this increase reflected the gains made due to the improved market conditions within the industry and increased market penetration during the significant revenue increase in combined with stronger margins and cost containment initiatives resulted in higher operating income within materials 
materials operating income  as a percentage of revenues  was  and for  and  respectively 
technologies operating income increased to million in  from million in the increase was driven by significant growth in thin film deposition services  the environmental and sensing product lines  and atmi s emosyn business  and increased operating leverage through a focus on overhead cost reduction in this segment 
technologies operating income improved to million in  compared to a million loss in the profitability increase was attributable to the growth in both environmental and sensing products and thin film deposition services revenues  the attendant product margin improvements and a favorable product mix shift along with an improvement in profitability of various contract programs 
investments in research and product development within emosyn and the company s other ventures are reflected in technologies operating income 
technologies operating income loss  as a percentage of revenues  was  and in  and  respectively 
other and interest income  net 
other and interest income  net  increased to million in from million in in  other income included a gain of approximately million on the sale of certain marketable equity securities by the company  offset by a write off of a million cost basis investment 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to proceeds received of approximately million related to the company s public stock offering in april and increased cash balances derived from improved operating results of the company 
other and interest income  net increased to approximately million in from million in the increase in related to a significant increase in interest income due to increased cash levels on hand throughout all of compared to only part of these increased cash levels resulted from a public stock offering that was completed at the beginning of the second quarter of an increase in interest rates in also resulted in increased interest income 
interest expense declined in due to lower levels of debt outstanding at december  compared to december  interest expense decreased to million in from million in income taxes 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in income tax expense increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate of differs from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily because of state and foreign income taxes  foreign sales corporation benefits  and non deductible merger and acquisition costs 
the effective tax rate was 
the decline in the effective rate in is based on the fact that there was a declining impact of acquired companies historic tax rates on restated financial statements in the current year 
the company incurred non deductible merger costs in and recognized benefit based on changes in estimates regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of certain acquired companies 
the effective tax rate of was higher than statutory rates because no tax benefit was recognized for the merger costs related to the now acquisition  and no tax benefit was recognized for operating losses sustained by acsi 
minority interest 
minority interest represented the interest held by kc tech co  ltd 
in the operations of adcs korea  which was a joint venture established to manufacture  sell and distribute chemicals to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea  in which atmi had the remaining interest 
on december   atmi purchased kc tech co  ltd

net income excluding merger related costs  other expenses  and one time gains 
over the last three years  the company has used mergers and acquisitions to accelerate its growth and broaden its product lines 
as a result of this strategy  the company has incurred expenses to consummate these transactions and integrate these acquired businesses into existing operations 
excluding merger and related costs pursuant to acquisitions  certain severance charges related to reorganizing the business pursuant to these acquisitions  and one time gains associated with the sale of certain securities  net income would have been million  or per share assuming dilution in  an increase of over million  or per share assuming dilution in the amount represents a increase over million  or per share assuming dilution in weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution increased to million shares for the year ended december   from million shares for the year ended december   which was an increase from million shares for the year ended december  the increase in primarily resulted from the completion of the april  public offering of million shares 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december   and to date  atmi has financed its activities principally through cash from operations  the sale of equity  external research and development funding and various lease and debt instruments 
the company s working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  net cash provided by operations was approximately million during  as compared to cash provided by operations of million during  and million in the cash flow from operations for resulted primarily from improvements in operating results  substantially offset by increased working capital requirements mainly accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the million of merger costs in reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  with approximately million remaining unpaid at december  in  operating cash flows improvement was driven primarily from an improvement in operating results  partially offset by increases in working capital accounts and deferred taxes 
in addition  the million of merger costs and related expenses in reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as million were non cash charges and approximately million remained unpaid at december  the million of merger costs and related expenses incurred in the third quarter of  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as approximately million remained unpaid at december  net cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to used in  and million used in in  the company sold marketable securities and received net proceeds of million for future working capital requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  the company s cash and cash equivalents included money market securities and commercial paper 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s portfolio  therefore  the company would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the company s securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows
