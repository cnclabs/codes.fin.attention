the company s chili s grill bar restaurants average weekly sales increased to  in fiscal versus  in fiscal the company s italian dining division s restaurant sales increased  to  in fiscal when compared to restaurant sales of  in fiscal the increase was due to the continued success of operational and marketing initiatives which increased average weekly sales to  in fiscal from  in fiscal total restaurant operating expenses were  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  total restaurant operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the following factors influenced the operating margins food and beverage costs were  or of total restaurant sales in fiscal  compared to  or of total restaurant sales in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of total revenue was mainly due to increased efficiencies and favorable commodity prices that resulted in decreased food costs at each of the company s restaurant concepts

this non cash asset impairment charge resulted from the company s determination that an impairment write down should be considered when there is a sustained trend of negative operating performance as measured by restaurant level cash flow 
the non cash facility closure charges include amounts for the write off of fixed assets and other costs related to the closing of these facilities

the company had operating income of  in fiscal compared to operating income of  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the non cash charges of  in fiscal total other expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the million non cash charge to reserve for the subordinated note 
the company had an increase in other income from transformational payments made by burger king to the company 
see item franchise and development agreements 
bruegger s corporation failed to make the interest payment on the subordinated note that was due to the company on december  and the company has subsequently been advised that the affiliate guarantors failed to make an interest payment that was due to their senior secured lender on january  the affiliate guarantors own and operate bruegger s bagel bakeries as franchisees of bruegger s franchise corporation  a subsidiary of bruegger s corporation 
the company believes that the bruegger s bagel bakeries operated by the affiliate guarantors constitute a majority of the bruegger s bagel bakery system and therefore account for a majority of bruegger s franchise corporation revenues 
the company has been advised that bruegger s franchise corporation has subordinated its right to receive royalty payments from the affiliate guarantors to the affiliate guarantors senior secured lender 
consequently  there can be no assurance when  if ever  the company might receive any principal or interest payments in respect of the subordinated note 
in view of these and other circumstances  as of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million non cash charge to fully reserve for the subordinated note 
income tax expense of  was recorded in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in income tax was mainly due to increased state income taxes

net operating loss carryforwards of million expire in and million expire in fica tip credits of million expire in   expire in   expire in and  expire in the alternative minimum tax credits of  carryforward indefinitely 
the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal years were examined by the internal revenue service irs 
the irs completed its audit during fiscal resulting in a change to the net operating loss carryover of million 
the increase to the net operating loss was the result of additional tax losses identified as a result of the disposition of various assets of the bagel businesses sold during fiscal at the end of fiscal the company had a valuation reserve against its net operating loss carryforwards of million resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
the company s assessment of its ability to realize the net deferred tax asset was based on the weight of both positive and negative evidence  including the taxable income of its current operations 
based on this assessment  the company s management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax benefit recorded will be realized 
such evidence will be reviewed prospectively and should the company s operating performance continue to improve  the company may recognize additional tax benefits related to its net deferred tax asset position in the future

on august  the company completed the refinancing of its existing debt with a financing package totaling  consisting of a  revolving credit agreement and a  mortgage facility  as described below 
the revolving credit agreement was executed with chase bank of texas  as agent for a group of six banks  providing for borrowings of up to  with interest payable at the adjusted libor rate plus a contractual spread

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  fasb issued fas no 
 which deferred the effective date of fas no 
in june  the fasb issued fas no 
 which amended fas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  fas no 
is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  fas no 
 as amended  requires that all changes in derivatives be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the company is currently not involved in derivative instruments or hedging activities and therefore the company does not expect any impact from fas no 
 as amended 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants
