our actual results may be materially different from the results we discuss in the forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed in the risk factors and other sections of this report 
overview we are a leading global designer  manufacturer and distributor of a broad range of plastic and glass eyeglass lenses and hold a leading manufacturing and technology position in the fast growing plastic lens segment of the global spectacle lens market 
we have sales offices in countries worldwide and operate in most major regions of the world 
we believe that we hold a top three market position in terms of volume of plastic eyeglass lenses sold in each major region where we operate  including north america  europe and rest of world consisting primarily of australia  asia and south america 
we focus our efforts on value added products  including products with advanced design characteristics  lens coatings and treatments and thin and light weight materials eg  polycarbonate 
approximately of our annual net sales are represented by value added products 
we market our spectacle lens products globally under the brands sola and american optical ao and distribute them globally through three primary channels direct to national chain retail  direct to retail outlets and wholesale distributors eg  independent processing laboratories 
additionally  in the united states we sell directly to managed care organizations  a rapidly growing segment of the spectacle lens market 
our business is organized into three primary markets north america  europe and rest of world 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately of our net sales from north america  from europe and from rest of world 
our organization has historically been managed on a decentralized basis with each operating unit having its own manufacturing facilities  distribution centers and inventory management systems 
this decentralized approach resulted in excess manufacturing capacity  redundant facilities in high cost regions and excessive distribution centers 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we initiated a strategic operating review designed to streamline manufacturing and distribution  reduce operating costs worldwide and write off inventory skus that are no longer being manufactured 
in april  we appointed jeremy bishop as our new president and chief executive officer 
following his appointment  mr 
bishop expanded the scope of our strategic cost cutting program and accelerated the implementation of our strategic initiatives begun in following completion of the strategic initiatives  operations will consist of four primary and seven specialized manufacturing facilities  two primary research and development centers  primary prescription laboratories and five primary distribution centers 
the charges recorded for these initiatives from fiscal through the end of fiscal  net of gains on asset sales  totaled approximately million  including million of associated inventory write offs classified in cost of sales  with a corresponding cash impact of approximately million 
the non cash charges relate primarily to the write off of equipment and other assets  as well as the impairment of goodwill 
the cash charges relate primarily to severance expenses and facility closures 
we realized approximately million of savings in fiscal year related to the initiatives implemented during fiscal and  and we expect to generate additional savings of approximately million annually beginning in fiscal year as a result of the actions taken in fiscal year additionally  cash proceeds are anticipated from sales of land and buildings made redundant by these initiatives  approximately million of which we realized in fiscal in addition to special charges  we incurred transition costs associated with executing our strategic initiatives 
these costs totaled million in fiscal and largely related to expenditures to execute the strategic actions eg  certain employee and facility costs and expenses incurred that will be eliminated upon completion of the strategic actions eg  manufacturing variances 
out business is somewhat seasonal  with fiscal third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season 
fiscal fourth quarter results are generally the strongest 
results of operations the following table shows the results of our operations for fiscal years  and fiscal year ended march  in thousands net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development expenses    selling and marketing expenses    general and administrative expenses including goodwill amortization    special charges    operating expenses    operating income loss    interest expense  net    income loss before provision benefit for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary item    provision benefit for income taxes   minority interest income loss before extraordinary item   extraordinary item  net income loss   net sales and selling and marketing expenses have been revised as a result of the retroactive adoption of eitf accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs

using constant currency exchange rates  fiscal sales increased compared with fiscal and increased compound annual growth compared with fiscal the following table shows certain items expressed as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses special charges operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary item provision benefit for income taxes minority interest extraordinary item net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
our net sales were million in fiscal  reflecting an increase of million or from million in fiscal using constant exchange rates  the percentage increase was 
the increase in net sales was primarily due to the european and rest of world regions offset in part by a decrease in net sales in the north american region 
net sales in the european region increased despite slowdowns in the united kingdom and germany 
this sales growth represents significant share gains across the continent 
these gains are attributable to strong sales of progressive lenses  particularly ao compact  strengthened sales and marketing strategies and the robust relationships developed by our prescription laboratories with customers in italy  france and belgium 
net sales in the rest of world region increased as a result of the continued market recovery in asia and south america  partially offset by lower sales in china and southeast asia 
the sales decline in the north american region occurred mostly in the second quarter due to temporarily limited distribution opportunities as a result of competitors acquisitions of independent processing laboratories 
net sales performances by region were as follows 
north america decreased by million or  
europe increased by million or  and 
rest of world increased by million or 
using constant exchange rates  the regional performances were as follows 
north america decreased by  
europe increased by  and 
rest of world increased by 
our value added products accounted for million or of net lens sales in fiscal compared to million or of net lens sales in fiscal this increase was led by growth in polycarbonate lens sales with a year on year increase of million or and increased sales in finalite of million 
gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit totaled million for fiscal compared to gross profit of million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
in calculating gross profit  we wrote off million of inventory in fiscal and million of inventory in fiscal and recorded million of transition costs in fiscal associated with our strategic initiatives 
if these inventory write offs and transition costs were excluded  gross profit would have been million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin  after adjusting for the inventory write offs and transition costs  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the gross margin decrease was principally due to continued underabsorption of overhead of million caused by reduced production levels and product mix changes 
we experience price competition  which can be severe in certain markets  particularly for our standard products 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses in fiscal totaled million compared to million for fiscal operating expenses included special charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also recorded million of transition costs related to our strategic initiatives in fiscal if these special charges and transition costs were excluded from operating expenses  operating expenses would have been million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
operating expenses  excluding the special charges and transition costs  for fiscal as a percentage of net sales were as compared to for fiscal research and development expenses of million for fiscal represented of net sales in fiscal as compared to research and development expenses of million or of net sales for fiscal the million or decrease in our research and development expenses was due in part to headcount reductions associated with the strategic initiatives approximately employees as well as the impact of the strong us dollar against non us dollar expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal and were million or of net sales in fiscal  despite increased costs associated with the initial launch of contour optics and sola technologies in fiscal our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal included in general and administrative expenses are charges associated with the devaluation of the brazilian real of million in fiscal and million in fiscal also included in fiscal general and administrative expenses is a million charge related to the write off of accounts receivable due to the bankruptcy of a customer in north america 
if these devaluation charges and receivable write off were excluded  general and administrative expenses would have been million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in our general and administrative expenses primarily relates to headcount reductions associated with the strategic initiatives approximately employees as well as additional reductions in overall spending levels 
primarily as a result of our strategic initiatives  which commenced in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded pretax special charges of million in fiscal we incurred million of expense associated with workforce reductions in north america  europe and australia 
included in the workforce reductions were employees from manufacturing  employees from sales and marketing  employees from administration  and employees from research and development 
at march   million cash had been paid related to workforce reductions incurred since fiscal the special charges include million related to the write off of molds  which were discontinued as a result of our efforts to standardize on a global basis product specifications 
also  we continued to transfer high volume production to low cost manufacturing locations and to consolidate manufacturing expertise into fewer production facilities 
as a result  we incurred special charges of million related to redundant equipment write offs and facility closure costs in fiscal additionally  as a result of our discontinuation of the development of the polycarbonate matrix product line  we incurred million in asset write offs  including equipment million and related commitments million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of land in north america of million associated with facility closures 
also included in special charges is million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with a prior acquisition of a lens manufacturing business 
this impairment is pursuant to sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as we decided to discontinue and cease operations of this lens manufacturing business and completely close down the facility

we anticipate that substantially all of the accrued liability will be paid in fiscal and will be funded through future asset sales and cash provided by operations 
we are in the process of selling land and buildings made redundant by the strategic initiatives  which may generate proceeds of up to approximately million 
we do not anticipate any additional special charges related to our current strategic initiatives 
we realized approximately million of savings in fiscal related to the initiatives implemented during fiscal and and anticipate continued annual savings of approximately million  primarily from workforce reductions 
beginning in fiscal  we expect additional annual savings of approximately million from lower production costs as a result of the actions taken in fiscal these savings will be partially mitigated by anticipated changes in product mix and price 
during the second half of fiscal  we incurred transition costs of million associated with executing our strategic initiatives 
these costs were primarily related to interim workforce expenses  manufacturing variances and out of pocket expenditures that we expect to be eliminated as we fully execute our strategic initiatives 
of these costs  million are reflected in cost of sales  million in research and development expenses  million in selling and marketing expenses and million in general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate our strategic initiatives will be substantially implemented during fiscal and anticipate incurring associated transition costs of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  primarily during the fourth quarter  we recorded pretax special charges of million 
we commenced consolidation of our mexican manufacturing operations in fiscal year and completed the consolidation in fiscal year included in the mexican manufacturing facilities consolidation charge of million are write offs of molds million and costs associated with combining the two manufacturing operations million 
the special charge amount includes million relating to workforce reductions in north america  europe and australia 
included in the workforce reductions were employees from manufacturing  employees from sales and marketing  employees from administration and employees from research and development 
we recorded a charge of million for provision against collection of accounts receivable in asia as a result of the economic slow down in the region during fiscal during fiscal year  we commenced the transfer of high volume production to low cost manufacturing locations and the consolidation of certain manufacturing expertise into fewer production facilities 
as a result  we incurred charges of million related to the write off of molds and million related to facility closure costs 
operating income loss 
our operating loss for fiscal totaled million  compared to operating income of million for fiscal operating income  excluding the special charges of million  transition costs of million  inventory write offs of million  and currency devaluation charges of million in fiscal and excluding special charges of million  inventory write offs of million  currency devaluation of million and accounts receivable write offs of million in fiscal  would have been million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
net interest expense 
our net interest expense totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to increased borrowing rates  waiver fees and borrowing levels in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
our combined state  federal and foreign tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal if the special charges were excluded from income before provision for income taxes  and the tax benefit associated with the special charges were excluded from the provision for income taxes  the resulting effective combined state  federal and foreign tax rate would have been in fiscal and in fiscal we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of march  amounting to approximately million 
whether we will be able to utilize these deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
extraordinary gain 
in june  we purchased million of our senior notes due as a result  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax of million  resulting from the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the purchase price 
the purchase was funded by our multicurrency credit agreement and resulted in a decline in net borrowings 
net income loss 
our net loss for fiscal totaled million compared to net income of million for fiscal in fiscal  if the special charges of million  transition costs of million  inventory write offs of million  currency devaluation charge of million  and extraordinary gain of million and associated taxes of million were excluded  our net income would have been million or per share

liquidity and capital resources our operating activities generated million in cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of continued decreased investments in working capital 
the increase in cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to decreased investments in working capital  offset in part by reduced net income 
during fiscal  our inventories decreased million exclusive of the write offs as a result of our strategic initiatives 
this decrease was a result of lower production levels and utilization of inventory on hand 
during fiscal  inventories increased million and as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat at compared to in fiscal net accounts receivable increased million in fiscal and as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was mainly due to increased sales in north america in the last month of fiscal net accounts receivable as a percentage of net sales in fiscal remained flat with the prior year at 
during fiscal  net cash expended on investing activities amounted to million 
included in this amount was million of capital expenditures  million for the acquisition of oracle lens manufacturing corporation  a polycarbonate lens manufacturer in rhode island  and million for the acquisition of the remaining interest in a wholesale laboratory group located in australia and new zealand 
the oracle acquisition was funded through borrowings under our multicurrency credit agreement and is expected to be accretive to earnings 
the most significant capital expenditures relate primarily to spending on polycarbonate production capacity in the us  mexico and australia as well as prescription laboratory capacity increases in france 
partially offsetting these expenditures was million of proceeds received from the sale of land in petaluma  california 
during fiscal  net cash expended on investing activities amounted to million 
of this amount  million represented capital expenditures  million related to investment in a joint venture in india and other trade investments  and million was for the acquisition of a wholesale laboratory in portugal in december the most significant capital expenditures in fiscal were made in the united states and europe  primarily related to capacity increases 
during fiscal  net cash expended on investing activities amounted to million 
of this amount million represented capital expenditures and million represented investment in acquisitions 
the most significant capital expenditures  primarily on additional production capacity and computer system upgrades  were made in the united states  mexico  brazil  italy and australia 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  of which approximately million annually is viewed as discretionary 
our net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily from borrowings on our credit facilities 
cash outflows in fiscal included million related to a stock buy back under our stock repurchase program 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased million of our senior notes due for million  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
the purchase was funded by borrowings under our multicurrency credit agreement and resulted in a decline in net borrowings 
at september   december  and march   we did not satisfy the leverage ratio covenant of our multicurrency credit agreement 
we obtained waivers of this breach from the lending banks 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain local credit facilities to provide credit for overdraft  working capital and some fixed asset investment purposes 
as of march   our total credit available under such facilities was approximately million  of which million had been utilized 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of million us million on the date of issuance notes due march  we may redeem these notes in whole or in part  at any time  on or after march   at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount plus a premium declining ratably to par plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages  if any 
prior to march   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of these notes at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages  if any 
we used the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of these notes to repay and terminate our multicurrency credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 
we are currently in the process of negotiating a three year million line of credit that we expect to be secured by domestic receivables and inventory and of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
we anticipate completing the financing in the second quarter of fiscal in order to continue our operations and meet our significant liquidity requirements  we must achieve profitable operations or obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  bank financing  and other sources 
we believe that our existing cash balances  foreign credit facilities  internally generated funds and other potential financing alternatives will be sufficient to meet our capital  operating and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if we are unable to generate adequate cash flow from sales of our products  we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay development or commercialization of certain products  or reduce the marketing  customer support  or other resources devoted to product development 
accordingly  our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
currency exchange rates as a result of our worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position 
the principal effect of currency exchange rates on our results of operations and financial position is translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have been made to shareholders equity 
primarily as a result of the strength of the us dollar  these translation adjustments were approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal because a portion of our debt is non us dollar denominated  we may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps 
we had not entered into any of these swaps or forward contracts as of march  the carrying amount of the forward contracts approximates fair value  which has been estimated based on current exchange rates 
for further financial data on our performance by region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal  with fiscal third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season 
fiscal fourth quarter results are generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect our cost of the goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in many markets limits our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and we are subject to price erosion in many of our standard product lines 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
for a description of the effects of inflation on our reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by us in response to inflationary conditions  see currency exchange rates 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
subsequently  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  we believe there will be no material impact resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
in march  fasb issued interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of opinion no 
for a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued an exposure draft related to business combinations 
if the final rules are adopted as proposed  as of april   we will no longer be required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings 
in addition  we will be required to periodically review goodwill for potential impairment 
if an impairment is found to exist  a charge will be taken against earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
we cannot currently determine the amount of an impairment charge  if any  that we would record upon adoption of these rules

without limiting the generality of the preceding statement  all statements in this report concerning or relating to estimated and projected earnings  margins  costs  expenditures  cash flows  growth rates and financial results are forward looking statements 
in addition  we  through our senior management  from time to time make forward looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments 
these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting our best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
other factors may affect the accuracy of these forward looking statements and our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements 
while it is impossible to identify all relevant factors  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us include  but are not limited to  those factors or conditions described below  as well as changes in the regulation of the spectacle lens industry at either or both of the federal and state levels  competitive pressures in the spectacle lens industry and our response to these factors  and general conditions in the economy and capital markets 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to sola and persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
risks relating to sola and the industry we operate in the highly competitive spectacle lens industry  and we may not be able to compete effectively with entities with more established operating histories and greater financial resources 
we operate in the highly competitive spectacle lens industry 
we compete primarily on the basis of customer service  quality and breadth of product offerings  innovation and price 
the spectacle lens industry is characterized by price competition  which can be severe in some of our markets  particularly for standard products 
we attempt  to the extent possible  to counter competition on the basis of price by focusing on providing a rapid response to orders  maintaining high fill rates  developing differentiated new products and educating processing laboratories and eyecare practitioners on the benefits of our lenses and coatings 
our competitors may develop products or services that are more effective or less expensive than our products or that could render certain of our products less competitive 
since recently developed products comprise a substantial portion of our sales  our performance and future growth are dependent upon our continuing ability to develop and market new products 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do to fund expansion and research and development 
within a particular market  certain of our competitors may enjoy a home country advantage over foreign competition 
we also face competition from a number of our principal competitors  such as essilor and hoya  that are vertically integrated with processing laboratories to a greater extent than we are 
this integration limits the number of independent processing laboratories to which we can market products 
since their acquisition by essilor and hoya  these laboratories have decreased the purchase of our products 
our sales to essilor and hoya owned laboratories were approximately of net sales in fiscal we are vertically integrated in europe and asia  but not in the united states 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have manufacturing and distribution sites in three major regions north america including mexico  europe and rest of world comprised primarily of australia  asia and south america 
approximately of our net sales in the fiscal year ended march  were derived from the sale of products outside the united states 
as a result  a significant portion of our sales and operations are subject to the risks inherent in international operations  including 
developments in the foreign political and economic environment may have an adverse effect on operations in those countries  
tax rates in certain foreign countries may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  
we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries  including staffing and managing foreign operations  
we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  
foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  and 
we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will be dependent  in part  on our ability to effectively manage these and other risks 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 
our cash flow is comprised of a variety of currencies 
although we may enter into currency swap agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt obligations  these hedging transactions  if entered into  will not eliminate that risk entirely 
as a result of our worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency exchange rates and inflation 
in addition  brazil currently faces an energy crisis and shortage of hydroelectric plant power 
at this time  we cannot determine the future impact of this situation  and  although we believe that it will not have a material impact on our operations  we cannot assure you that will be the case 
we may not be able to continually reduce manufacturing costs 
to maintain and or strengthen our competitive position within the spectacle lens industry  we must continually reduce our product manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
in addition to normal cost reduction activities  we recently initiated product migration and standardization activities and reduced the number of people employed worldwide 
these reductions are necessary to help offset price decreases  inflationary pressures and changes in product and regional mix 
to the extent our cost reduction activities are unsuccessful  in part or in full  our ability to compete may be significantly impacted 
we concentrate a large part of our manufacturing operations in tijuana  mexico 
currently  approximately of our manufacturing operations are based in three facilities in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood  earthquake  war  work stoppage  supply shortage or disruption  adverse government action or other disaster or condition could result in a loss of production capabilities  and accordingly  impede our ability to meet our customers requirements 
we must continue to develop new and enhanced products 
we are continually developing new and enhanced products in an effort to develop incremental sales and improved gross margins 
our ability to develop new and enhanced products successfully will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
some of our products may become obsolete  and we may not achieve the technological advances necessary for us to remain competitive 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions  such as lack of market acceptance and delays in product development 
our results may be affected by our ability to generate sales from new products as anticipated and the costs of such introductions 
we compete against alternative technologies and treatments that provide a substitute for spectacle lenses 
spectacle lenses compete with other methods of vision correction  including laser surgery and contact lenses 
as these technologies evolve  they may provide more competition to the spectacle lens business and lead to declines in our net sales 
we conduct all of our foreign operations through subsidiaries and the payment of dividends by these entities may be restricted 
we conduct all of our foreign operations through subsidiaries 
these operations contribute significantly to our sales and profitability 
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries are in many instances subject to statutory restrictions  are contingent upon the results of operations of those subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations 
dividends and other payments to us from subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions are subject to legal restrictions and may have adverse tax consequences to us 
management reviews the need for cash distributions to us from our foreign subsidiaries on a case by case basis 
if the need for cash distributions from the subsidiaries should arise in the future  there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries will be permitted to make such cash distributions without legal restrictions or adverse tax consequences to us 
we are dependent on a small number of suppliers for raw materials 
most of the raw materials used in our products are readily available from a number of suppliers at competitive prices  and we have not experienced any significant shortages in obtaining raw materials 
while there are currently multiple suppliers of polycarbonate and monomer raw materials  we purchase over of those materials from three suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers  or a significant decrease in the supply of polycarbonate or monomer  would require us to obtain these raw materials elsewhere 
if we were unable to obtain polycarbonate or monomer from other suppliers at acceptable prices  we might achieve lower margins and experience difficulty in meeting our customers requirements 
in addition  our photochromic lenses are processed by a third party using technology that is proprietary to it 
we are dependent upon the north american chain retail channel 
distribution to national chain retail  super optical retail stores and retail buying groups is a growing distribution channel for spectacle lenses 
we believe this distribution channel will continue to be important to sustain growth and profitability 
while we are currently well positioned in this distribution channel through relationships with key retailers  these relationships could terminate or these retailers could choose one or more of our competitors to provide them with lenses in the future 
additionally  these retailers could choose to process and distribute lenses themselves rather than purchasing the lenses from us or any other third party 
we may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations to which we are subject 
as with our competitors  we must comply with us and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  waste water discharges and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes  and with other federal  state and foreign laws and regulations 
we believe that we possess all material permits and licenses necessary for the continuing operation of our business and believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws 
we cannot assure you that we will operate at all times in complete compliance with all such requirements 
we could be subject to potentially significant fines and penalties for any noncompliance that may occur 
it is impossible to predict accurately what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future 
our success depends on our key personnel and we may not be able to retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract personnel with spectacle industry experience 
we may face competition in recruiting this personnel and accordingly experience difficulty in growing and succeeding 
the loss of the services of this personnel or the ability to retain such personnel in the future could hinder the implementation of our business strategy 
we do not carry key man insurance on our senior management team 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness that may limit our ability to respond to market conditions including our ability to satisfy capital expenditure requirements or to meet our contractual or financial obligations 
in addition  the debt instruments governing our indebtedness are subject to covenants that could limit our ability to conduct our business 
furthermore  our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future performance 
our future performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
interest on our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and euro million aggregate principal amount of notes due will be payable in cash semi annually through and including march  although we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our capital expenditure requirements  we cannot guarantee that this will be the case 
our charter and by laws contain antitakeover provisions that could make the acquisition of sola more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of sola 
for example  our by laws include advance notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors as well as to submit proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that could have the effect of delaying or hindering a possible takeover of sola 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sola 
risks relating to our common stock the public market for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including 
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  
announcements of new products by us or our competitors  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
trends in our business environment  including competitive and pricing pressures  and 
general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions like recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  including seasonal variances in demand for our products  the cost of product introductions  changes in product mix  our ability to control costs  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other factors described in this risk factors section of this report 
for example  all other factors aside  our results are generally weakest in the third quarter as a result of lower sales during the holiday season and strongest in the fourth quarter 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long term debt and any future financing requirements 
during fiscal  fixed rate debt consisted primarily of outstanding balances on senior notes  and variable rate debt related primarily to borrowings under our multicurrency credit agreement  which was terminated on april  the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates expected on our existing long term debt instruments 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of march  expected maturity date as of march  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate debt      weighted average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt    weighted average interest rate the above table does not reflect our euro million notes issued april  including this debt  fixed rate debt maturing beyond fiscal would be approximately  and the weighted average interest rate would be 
currency rate risk 
our subsidiaries primarily operate in foreign markets  and predominantly have their local currencies as their functional currencies 
these subsidiaries do not have third party borrowings in currencies other than their local currencies  and therefore there are no appropriate quantitative disclosures 
qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 
our ability to pay or refinance long term borrowings at maturity at market rates  
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants  and 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations or business acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt 
while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt  or the impact interest rate movements might have on existing debt  we evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to 
our global operations  whereby approximately of our revenues are derived from operations outside the united states  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  
the ability of our operations to satisfy cash flow requirements of predominantly euro and us dollar denominated long term debt without the need to repatriate earnings and profits  which are denominated in currencies other than the euro and us dollar  
our investments in foreign subsidiaries being primarily directly from the us parent  resulting in us dollar investments in foreign currency functional companies  and 
the location of our operating subsidiaries in a number of countries that have seen significant exchange rate changes against the us dollar  primarily downwards in recent years  such as brazil  mexico  china  venezuela and other asian countries 
we manage our currency rate risks through a variety of measures 
we negotiated as part of our multicurrency credit agreement a multicurrency facility so that local borrowings could be made in the currency of the local entity  while still obtaining the benefits of central borrowing capability 
this agreement was terminated on april  in addition  in certain limited instances  subsidiaries  after obtaining approval from our head office  will enter into forward exchange contracts in connection with inter company purchases and sales of products 
these contracts do not extend longer than one year and are immaterial to the overall operations of the group 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations on our euro million notes  due  issued april  this liability remains unhedged as of june  subsidiaries operating in high inflation environments protect margins by methods that include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
we disclose constant exchange rate net sales performances in the aggregate  as well as by region  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

european monetary union conversion to the euro we have instituted a euro conversion team and begun preparation for the conversion by twelve member states of the european monetary union to a common currency  the euro 
conversion to the euro by these member states of the european monetary union will take place on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis between january  and january  by january   all companies operating in the twelve member states will be required to be fully operational using the new currency 
the euro conversion team has primarily addressed the accounting and information systems changes that are necessary to facilitate trading in the euro  the possible marketplace implications of a common currency and the currency exchange rate risks  with the initial emphasis placed on the system modifications 
we believe that the financial impact of conversion to a euro based currency will not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
