item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of program management  consulting services and systems solutions primarily to state and local government agencies throughout the united states 
since our inception in  we have been at the forefront of innovation in meeting our mission of helping government serve the people 
we use our expertise  experience and advanced information technology to make government operations more efficient and cost effective while improving the quality of services provided to program beneficiaries 
we have had contracts with government agencies in all states  of the largest cities and of the largest counties 
we have been profitable every year since we were founded 
for the fiscal year ended september   we had revenues of million and income  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  of million 
prior to october  we conducted our operations through two groups the government operations group and the consulting group 
in october  we reorganized our groups to better focus and manage our existing and future technology assets 
our core technology assets were moved from our consulting group to our newly created systems group 
accordingly  prior period financial information has been reclassified to reflect current period presentation of segment information 
our revenues are generated from contracts with various payment arrangements  including fixed price  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  performance based criteria  and time and materials reimbursement used primarily by the consulting group 
for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from fixed price contracts were approximately of total revenues  revenues from cost plus contracts were approximately of total revenues  revenues from performance based contracts were approximately of total revenues  and revenues from time and materials reimbursement contracts were approximately of total revenues 
traditionally  a majority of our contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based and federal government contracts have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts because we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns or inaccurate revenue estimates 
we recognize revenues from cost plus contracts  including a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee  as costs are incurred 
we recognize revenues from fixed price and time and materials reimbursement contracts  including a portion of our estimated profit  as costs are incurred 
during fiscal and fiscal  revenues from performance based contracts  including a portion of estimated profit  were recognized as costs were incurred 
in fiscal  we changed our method of revenue recognition for performance based contracts to recognize revenues as such revenues become fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers rather than as costs are incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
each quarter  management reviews the costs incurred  the revenues recognized and billings from government contracts to adjust recognized revenue amounts 
the government operations group s contracts generally contain base periods of one or more years as well as one or more option periods that may cover more than half of the potential contract duration 
as of september   our average government operations group contract duration was approximately years 
our consulting group contracts had performance periods ranging from one month to approximately two years 
our average systems group contract duration was approximately years 
our most significant expense is cost of revenues  which consists primarily of project related employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or to achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the service costs related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials reimbursement contracts 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the client 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of management  marketing and administration costs including salaries  benefits  travel  recruiting  continuing education and training  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications and equipment depreciation 
business combinations and acquisitions we combined with four firms during  all of which were transactions accounted for as pooling of interests  four firms during  three of which were accounted for as purchases and one of which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and four firms during fiscal and one firm in fiscal  each of which was accounted for as a purchase 
additionally  we acquired substantially all of the assets of two firms and a division of another during fiscal in fiscal  our focus was on the consolidation and integration of our previous acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to continue to selectively identify and pursue complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach and the breadth and depth of our services and to enhance our customer base 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have completed the following acquisition transactions acquired company description of business date purchase price intangible assets recorded opportunity america llc employment training and placement may  strategic partners international llc activity based costing systems july  technology management resources child support collection services april  valuation resource management  inc asset inventorying and valuation services april  asset works  inc infrastructure management systems april  g international  inc smart card systems march  crawford consulting  inc web enabled information systems march  public systems  inc client server management systems october  we recognize the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses as intangible assets 
at september  and  intangible assets  net of related amortization  represented approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
the carrying values of intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  are reviewed for impairment if changes in the facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of their carrying value 
the principle factor we use in identifying potential impairment is profitability of the acquired business 
any impairment would be recognized when the expected future operating cash flows from such intangible assets is less than their carrying value 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas and fas other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we intend to apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning the first quarter of fiscal year results of operations set forth in the table below are the percentages of revenue for selected income statement data for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended september  year ended september  revenues government operations group consulting group systems group total revenues cost of revenues gross profit government operations group consulting group systems group total gross profit as percentage of total revenues selling general and administrative expenses merger  deferred compensation and esop expense amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles legal settlement expense income from operations interest and other income income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues

income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of income before income taxes  the income tax expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the non deductibility of the legal settlement expense in fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues

income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of income before income taxes  the income tax expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the non deductibility of the legal settlement expense discussed above 
quarterly results set forth in item of this annual report on form k are selected income statement data for the eight quarters ended september  we derived this information from unaudited quarterly financial statements that include  in the opinion of our management  all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for such periods 
you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our revenues and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenues earned on contracts  the timing of revenues on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenues 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
during the quarterly periods in fiscal years and  we recorded goodwill amortization expense as follows quarter ended december  march  june  september  in thousands government operations consulting systems quarter ended december  march  june  september  in thousands government operations consulting systems beginning october   goodwill will no longer be expensed under fas the pro forma impact of not recognizing goodwill amortization expense in fiscal and would have resulted in an increase to net income and diluted earnings per share as follows quarter ended december  march  june  september  in thousands  except per share data increase in net income diluted earnings per share december  march  june  september  increase in net income diluted earnings per share liquidity and capital resources for the year ended september   cash provided by operations was million as compared to million for the year ended september  higher income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization  the cumulative effect of an accounting change and the tax benefit due to option exercises has favorably impacted our operating cash flow 
improvements in the billing and realization of accounts receivable collections  from an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings ie  unbilled receivables of million in fiscal to a decrease in unbilled receivables of million in fiscal  had a significant positive effect in fiscal for the year ended september   cash used in investing activities was million as compared to million for the year ended september  cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  primarily consisted of expenditures for capitalized software costs totaling million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
during the year ended september   we generated cash from sales of marketable securities  substantially all of which consisted of short term municipal bonds totaling million  and used million in cash for acquisitions as well as expenditures for capitalized software costs totaling million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the million of cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  consisted of purchases of marketable securities totaling million  million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston  virginia  million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended september  was million  which consisted primarily of million of proceeds  net of offering expenses  from the secondary stock offering completed in june and sales of stock to employees through our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan of million 
cash used in financing activities during the year ended september  totaled million and consisted of million of payments on borrowings of companies acquired  offset by the receipt of proceeds of million from sales of stock to employees through our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during the year ended september  and consisted primarily of million of proceeds  net of offering expenses  from our secondary offering of common stock that we completed in december as a consequence of the terrorist attacks on september   we believe that the unanticipated expenses of heightened security measures implemented by federal  state and local governmental agencies may exceed budgeted amounts 
in the near term  we believe that these government agencies will have sufficient resources to continue to fund increased security measures without significant budget adjustments 
therefore  we currently expect that the market for our services will remain relatively unchanged 
however  our expectation assumes that the terrorist attacks on september were a one time event and that there will be no additional events of this magnitude 
if additional events should occur that result in significantly greater expenditures for tighter security measures  or such additional security measures are required to be sustained for extended periods of time  then the amounts budgeted for our services by governmental agencies may be reduced or reallocated  in some cases significantly  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital cash needs over the next twelve months
