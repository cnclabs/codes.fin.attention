performance overview the company recorded net income of  for compared to  for s results continue to reflect the cost of the company s expansion strategy as the bank has grown to twenty five retail banking branches  and ten residential mortgage lending offices 
also contributing to the decrease in earnings is the increase in the provision for loan losses as the company continued to realize significant loan growth 
basic net income per share for the year ended december  was per share  compared to per share reported last year 
total assets increased by  or  reflecting significant increases in loans and deposits 
loans outstanding increased by  or  while deposits grew by  or 
growth statistics for loans and deposits continue to compare favorably to industry averages  and reflect the company s continued efforts in business development and advertising 
stockholders equity increased  or reflecting improvements in the market value of the company s available for sale securities portfolio as well as a  capital contribution from members of the company s board of directors and executive management 
net interest income margins the primary source of earnings for the company is net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on the interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between the interest earning assets and the company s funding sources 
net interest income increased to  for  an increase from the net interest income of  earned for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in average earning assets  which totaled  for  a increase as compared to  for average loans increased by to  and average investments and other earning assets decreased by to  the increase in loans reflects the company s expansion of its commercial and real estate lending activities among middle market borrowers in the baltimore washington area  the growth of the bank s mortgage banking subsidiary  fmmc  and the increased emphasis on consumer lending 
the decrease in investments and other earning assets was primarily the result of normal runoff in the bank s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
earning asset growth was funded by an increase in average interest bearing deposits of  or 
other borrowed funds decreased by  or 
the increase in deposits was due to the aggressive expansion of the company s retail banking network to twenty five branches  the continued popularity of the bank s money market maximizer product  and growth in certificate of deposit products 
the decrease in borrowings occurred  as deposit growth was more than sufficient to fund earning asset growth 
interest income on loans increased to  for which represents an increase of  or from  for in addition to higher average balances on loans  yields increased due to several increases in market interest rates throughout the year 
interest income on investments and other earning assets increased to  for which represents an increase of  or from  while overall average balances decreased on investments and other earning assets  yields on short term investments improved 
interest expense on deposits increased to  in  an increase of  or from  for in addition to the increases in average balances  higher market interest rates increased the rates paid on money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
interest expense on borrowings increased to  for  an increase of  or from  for higher interest costs for short term borrowings more than offset declines in average balances 
the key performance measure for net interest income is the net interest margin  or net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the company s net interest margin is affected by loan pricing  mix of earning assets  and the distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december  as compared to for yields on earning assets increased by basis points  while the cost of interest bearing deposits increased by basis points and the cost of other borrowings increased by basis points 
a higher mix of loans as a percentage of earning assets and higher average balances on non interest deposit accounts offset the higher costs of deposits and borrowings 
table comparative average balances yields and rates below indicates the company s average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and average yields and rates 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as non interest bearing deposits

table rate volume variance below indicates the changes in the company s net interest income as a result of changes in volume and rates 
changes in interest income and interest expense can result from variances in both volume and rates 
the company has an asset and liability management policy designed to provide a proper balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities to attempt to optimize interest margins and to provide adequate liquidity for anticipated needs

noninterest income for year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to increased service fees on deposits  higher gains recognized on the sale of securities  and increases in other mortgage banking fees

this increase reflects management s continued emphasis on growth through branching  costs associated with the data processing conversion  as well as significant increases in loans  deposits and mortgage banking activities 
salaries and benefits increased  or primarily due to additional staffing as a result of the branch expansion  staffing increases to support loan and deposit growth  as well as regular salary increases and higher benefit costs 
occupancy costs grew for in the amount of  or when compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to the additional branches and mortgage offices  as well as additional space requirements at the operations facility

management anticipates that it is more likely than not that the future operations of first mariner bancorp will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the potential utilization of the net operating loss carryforward 
a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforward of  has been established to reflect this uncertainty 
financial condition at december   the company s total assets were  as compared to  at december   an increase of 
this increase was due to the continued growth in the branching network  expansion of business development efforts  and continued marketing of deposit and loan products 
the bank s overall growth in its core business  generating loans and gathering of deposits grew at a higher rate than overall asset growth as decreases in investment securities and other borrowings offset some of the growth in loans and deposits 
loans at december  were  as compared to  on december   which represents an increase of  or 
growth occurred in all categories of loans 
loans held for sale increased by  investment securities and interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased by  as normal runoff occurred in the bank s mortgage backed securities portfolio and short term investments were used to pay down other borrowing and fund loan growth 
total deposits increased by  an increase of from  at december  other borrowings  including repurchase agreements  decreased by  and reduced overall dependence on borrowed funds to of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  composition of loan portfolio because loans are expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume of loans and the volume as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the composition of the bank s loan portfolio 
table loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands type of loans commercial      commercial real estate and construction      residential real estate      consumer      total loans      add unamortized loan premiums less unearned income loans receivable      table maturity schedule of selected loans december  more than years up to year to one year to years years years total residential real estate      commercial real estate and construction      commercial      consumer      total      fixed interest rate      variable interest rate      total      december  more than years up to year to one year to years years years total residential real estate     commercial real estate and construction     commercial     consumer    total      fixed interest rate      variable interest rate      total      december  more than years up to year to one year to years years years total residential real estate     commercial real estate and construction      commercial      consumer      total      fixed interest rate      variable interest rate      total      the bank s loan portfolio composition as of december  reflects a concentration in commercial real estate and construction loans 
this category of loans increased by  and was primarily driven by increases in the bank s residential construction portfolio 
the residential construction portfolio consists of loans to individuals for construction of their primary residence 
these loans are generally converted to a permanent first mortgage upon completion of the construction and are underwritten for eventual sale in the secondary market 
residential real estate loans  which consist primarily of year and year adjustable rate mortgages  increased by  commercial loans increased by  consumer loans  comprised primarily of second mortgage loans  increased by approximately of the bank s loans have adjustable rates as of december  and approximately at december   the majority of which are adjustable rate first mortgages indexed to us treasury obligations 
interest rates on variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  the interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall the interest earned would decline  thus impacting the company s interest income 
see also the discussion under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity below 
the preceeding table sets forth the maturity distribution  classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rate  for the bank s loan portfolio at december   and some of the loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  the preceeding table should not be used as a forecast of future cash collections 
the scheduled repayments as shown above are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due 
loan quality the bank attempts to manage the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio through various control processes  such as credit evaluation of borrowers  establishment of lending limits and application of lending procedures  including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances 
however  the bank seeks to rely primarily on the cash flow of its borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies are designed to minimize risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as well as general and regional economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require special attention 
for significant problem loans  management s review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and the guarantor  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
specific reserves against the remaining loan portfolio are based on analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan chargeoffs  delinquency trends  previous collection experience  and the risk rating on each individual loan along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
table allowance for loan loss allocation  which is set forth below  indicates the specific reserves allocated by loan type and also the general reserves included in the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the company had approximately  in nonaccrual loans as compared with  at december  the company held other real estate owned of  at december  compared to  at december  the increase in other real estate owned was due to the foreclosure on several loans previously in nonaccrual status  as well as an increase in foreclosures on residential real estate 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to maintain the allowance at a level management has determined to be adequate based upon factors noted above 
the company provided  for loan losses for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily to provide coverage of the higher level of loan growth in  compared to as of december  the allowance for loan losses was  as compared with the december  balance of  an increase of  or 
net charge offs of  and  were recognized for and  respectively 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from for to in the growth in the allowance was driven by the growth and mix in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represented of outstanding loans at december  and december  the following table allowance for loan losses summarizes the allowance activities 
table allowance for loan losses years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses  beginning of year     loans charged off commercial real estate consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial real estate consumer total recoveries net chargeoffs provision for loan losses    allowance for loan losses  end of year      loans net of premiums and discounts excluding loans held for sale period end balance      average balance during period      allowance as percentage of period end loan balance percent of average loans provision for loan losses net chargeoffs management s judgment as to the level of future losses on existing loans is based on management s internal review of the loan portfolio  including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position  the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
however  management s determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future period will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans may be classified as non accrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrowers financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
interest is not recognized on any non accrual loans except residential real estate loans is recognized only when received 
the following table summarizes the allocation of allowance by loan type

the allowance for loan losses represented of nonperforming assets as of december  compared to as of december  at december   the allowance for loan losses represented of nonaccruing loans compared to at december  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
at december   other real estate owned included a land development project consisting of residential building lots with a carrying value of approximately  the land development project is being completed under the direction of the company 
currently  the remaining lots are under contract for settlement through may in addition  nine single family lots with a carrying value of  a commercial property with a carrying value of  and thirteen single family units with a carrying value of  were also included in other real estate owned 
capital resources stockholders equity totaled  as of december  as compared to  as of december   an increase of 
the increase of  was the result of the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss of  the net retention of earnings of  and the issuance of additional capital of  cash dividends of two cents per share were declared and paid in the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects the increase in value of the company s available for sale securities 
as market interest rates declined throughout the long term fixed rate nature of these securities resulted in an increase in market valuation 
the additional capital of  resulted from a contribution of capital by members of the company s board of directors and executive management of  as well as shares issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan of  banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher deemed credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
the company and the bank have agreed with the federal reserve bank of richmond  the fdic  and the state banking commissioner to submit plans to improve earnings and maintain capital levels commensurate with the growth plans of the company and the bank 
the company will comply with the federal reserve policy dated november  concerning the payment of cash dividends and will not incur additional debt at the holding company level without federal reserve approval 
management believes that these agreements do not restrict or impede the bank s ability to conduct normal banking and business transactions 
management is committed to complying with the provisions of the agreement 
to date  the company has provided its capital requirements mainly through the funds received for its stock offerings 
in the future  the company may consider raising capital from time to time through an offering of common stock or other securities 
as reflected in table capital ratios  the company exceeded its capital adequacy requirements as of december  and and meets the requirements for well capitalized status under federal banking regulations 
the company continually monitors its capital adequacy ratios to assure that the company exceeds regulatory capital requirements 
capital is classified as tier common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter 
the company s capital position is presented in the following table table capital ratios minimum to be well december  requirements capitalized under for capital prompt corrective adequacy purposes action provision total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital leverage ratio the bank also maintains capital levels which qualify for well capitalized status under current regulatory guidelines 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the bank s capital adequacy ratios 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of earning assets and funding sources 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income 
net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of interest rate movements  management endeavors to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute interest rate sensitivity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the company s management and the board of directors oversee the asset liability management function with the board of directors asset liability committee and meeting periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies for the company 
the asset mix of the statement of financial condition is continually evaluated in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
in theory  interest rate risk can be diminished by maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of funding sources 
accordingly  the company undertakes to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with management s expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  management may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps or caps  to manage its exposure to interest rate movements 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize the overall interest rate risk to the company 
the interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in table rate sensitivity analysis 
assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities which are based on prevailing prepayments assumptions and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   the company s interest sensitive liabilities exceeded interest sensitive assets within a one year period by  or of total assets compared to  or of total assets at december  the decrease in the interest rate sensitivity gap occurred due to the lower levels of longer term fixed rate investment securities as well as the purchase of an off balance sheet hedge  which is discussed in greater detail below 
in addition to the use of interest rate sensitivity reports  the company tests its interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
earnings simulation models are used to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have the company s net interest income and net income 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  are included in the analysis 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change 
at december   the company s estimated earnings sensitivity profile reflected a minimal sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on an assumed increase of basis points over a one year period  the company s net interest income would decrease by if rates were to increase and decrease by if rates were to decline 
the bank purchased an interest rate cap during to hedge a portion of its borrowing position  and thereby protect a portion of the bank s exposure to increasing interest rates 
the interest rate cap purchased had a notional amount of  a maturity of march  and is based on a cap rate of 
the notional amount represents the unit of measure to determine payments  and is not an exchange of principal 
any credit risk is equal to the fair value of the cap if the counterparty fails to perform  which is usually a small percentage of the notional amount 
counterparty risk is mitigated by executing transactions with highly rated counterparties using international derivatives association master agreements 
cap payments are made quarterly  and are based upon month libor london inter bank offering rate 
to the degree month libor exceeds at the quarterly measurement periods  the bank receives payments based on the difference between month libor and the cap rate of with the notional amount representing the unit of measure to determine the payment 
the interest rate cap was purchased for  and is being amortized using the straight line method 
as of december   the unamortized portion of the interest rate cap totaled  and had a fair value of  which represents the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform

liquidity is derived from increased customer deposits  the maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  loan repayment and income from earning assets 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was and for december  and respectively 
funds received from new and existing depositors  provided a large source of liquidity for the years ended december  and the bank seeks to rely primarily on core deposits from customers to provide stable and cost effective sources of funding to support loan growth
