in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders 
these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in rental revenues in the existing portfolio and from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment  the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate 
cash dividends paid increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the company s dividend payout ratio  based on funds from operations on a per basic common share basis  for  and was approximately  and  respectively

such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans

changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction
