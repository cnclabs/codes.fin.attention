item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference 
title the title segment includes the functions of searching  examining  closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property 
examination and closing 
the purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred  what debts are owed on it and what the title policy coverage will be 
this involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds  mortgages  wills  divorce decrees  court judgments  liens  paving assessments and tax records 
at the closing or settlement  the seller executes a deed to the new owner 
the buyer typically signs new mortgage documents 
closing funds are then disbursed to the seller  the prior mortgage company  real estate brokers  the title company and others 
the documents are then recorded in the public records 
a title policy is generally issued to both the lender and new owner 
title policies 
lenders in the usa generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate  including securitized lending 
this is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position 
the purchasers of the property want the assurance given in their policy against claims that may arise against their ownership 
the face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan 
title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance 
fire  auto  health and life insurance protect against losses and events in the future 
in contrast  title insurance seeks to eliminate most risks through the examination and settlement process 
investments 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of its investments 
these policies include an emphasis on credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending on market conditions 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale 
losses 
losses on policies occur because of a title defect not discovered during the examination and settlement process 
other reasons for losses include forgeries  misrepresentations  unrecorded construction liens  the failure to pay off existing liens  mishandling of settlement funds  issuance by agents of unauthorized coverages and other legal issues 
some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits 
such claims are based on various legal theories usually alleging misrepresentation by an issuing office 
although the company vigorously defends against spurious claims  it has from time to time incurred a loss in excess of policy limits 
experience shows that most claims against policies and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued  although claims may be made many years later 
by their nature  claims are often complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims 
estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims  the long periods of time over which claims are paid  significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors 
the company s liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and other losses expected to be reported in the future 
the amount of the reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that the company expects to incur on policy losses and in costs to settle claims 
provisions are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized 
the amounts provided are based on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages  current legal environment and types of policies written 
amounts shown as the company s estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate 
independent actuaries also review the adequacy of the liability amounts on an annual basis 
in accordance with industry practice  the amounts have not been discounted to their present values 
factors affecting revenues 
title revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market and the prices at which real estate sales are made 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases 
other factors include demand by buyers  consumer confidence and family incomes 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
generally  the third quarter is the most active in terms of real estate sales and the first quarter is the least active 
selected information for the national real estate industry follows amounts are preliminary housing starts millions housing resales millions housing resales median sales price in thousands customers 
the primary sources of title business are attorneys  builders  developers  lenders and real estate brokers 
no one customer was responsible for as much as ten percent of stewart s title revenues in any of the last three years 
titles insured included residential and commercial properties  undeveloped acreage  farms and ranches 
service  location  financial strength  size and related factors affect customer acceptance 
increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service 
the parties to a closing are concerned with personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement 
the rates charged to customers are regulated to varying degrees by different states 
financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing the company s agency network

based on unconsolidated statutory net premiums written for amounts are not available  stewart title guaranty company guaranty is one of the leading individual title insurers in america 
competitors include names are abbreviated fidelity  first american  land america and old republic 
as do most title insurers  stewart also competes with abstractors  attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney owned title insurance bar funds 
a number of home builders  financial institutions  real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agents  some of which issue policies underwritten by guaranty 
this controlled business also provides competition for stewart s agents 
offices

regulations 
title insurance companies are subject to extensive state regulations covering rates  agent licensing  policy forms  trade practices  reserve requirements  investments and the flow of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transaction 
kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by certain state and federal laws 
real estate information the real estate information segment primarily provides electronic delivery of services related to real estate transactions 
these services include title reports  flood determinations  property appraisals  mortgage documents  credit reports and tax services 
this segment also provides post closing services to lenders  including document retrievals  assignments  lien releases  recordation  collateral reviews and loan pool certifications 
in addition  this segment provides services related to section tax deferred exchanges  mapping  and construction and maintenance of title plants for county clerks  tax assessors and title agencies 
factors affecting revenues 
as in the title segment  rei revenues are also closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market 
customers 
the primary sources of rei business are lenders 
other customers include title offices  real estate brokers  attorneys  municipalities and courthouses 
the most important factor affecting customer acceptance and market share growth is superior customer service 
similar to the title operations  the real estate information being provided by the companies in this segment are a part of the closing process which is driven by personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement 
general technology 
stewart s automation products and services are increasing productivity in the title office and speeding the real estate closing process for lenders  real estate professionals and consumers 
in the past  an order typically required several individuals to search the title  retrieve and review documents and finally create the actual commitment 
today  on a normal subdivision file  one person can receive the order electronically and  on the same screen  view the prior file  examine the index of documents  retrieve and review electronically stored documents  prepare the commitment and deliver the product

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a comparison of the results of operations of the company for with and with follows 
general 
the company s two segments of operations are title and real estate information rei 
in general  the principal factors that contribute to increases in the company s operating revenues for both segments include declining mortgage interest rates which usually increase home sales and refinancing transactions  rising home prices  higher premium rates  increased market share  additional revenues from new offices and increased revenues from commercial transactions 
although relatively few in number  large commercial transactions typically yield higher premiums 
according to published industry data  interest rates for year fixed mortgages  excluding points  for the year averaged as compared to in rates averaged in the rates in were steady at slightly above or below the mark throughout the year 
in  rates stayed at about that same level until june when they began a decided move upward 
at year end  rates were just over 
in  the upward trend continued  with rates reaching a peak of in may 
then  rates declined for seven consecutive months 
at year end rates were 
operating in these mortgage interest rate environments and in strong general economies  real estate activity in was very strong 
in  existing home sales remained strong  increasing about 
however  refinancing transactions dropped significantly during the second half of in  existing home sales declined about from refinancing transactions also continued to decline in the annual average for refinancing to total loan applications was in  in and in at the end of  however  refinancings had increased to about 
title revenues 
the company s revenues from premiums  fees and other revenues decreased in over  while increasing in over the number of direct closings handled by the company decreased in and in the average revenue per closing increased in and in because of higher home prices  increased commercial transactions  and due to the significant drop in in the number of refinancings with their lower premiums 
a reduction in texas title premium rates became effective august  there were no other major revenue rate changes in  or premiums from agents decreased to million in and increased to million in from in the decrease in resulted primarily from declining refinancings and regular transactions handled by agents nationwide 
while premiums in nearly all states declined in  the largest decreases were in california  florida and oregon 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the same factors affecting direct operations mentioned above  along with the inherent delay in agents reporting policies on transactions 
at the end of  refinancing transactions were unusually high 
other revenues in included million in losses in an equity investee startup operation 
in other revenues included a million pretax gain resulting from a settlement of a lawsuit and a related sale of an equity ownership in a title agency 
title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title revenues for the last three years were amounts millions percentages texas california new york florida all others rei revenues 
real estate information revenues were million in  million in and million in the decrease in resulted primarily from decreased real estate transactions and fewer ongoing mapping and title plant projects 
the increase in was primarily due to a significant number of new businesses started and additional income earned from existing operations 
the increases in were partially offset by a decrease in business volume due to increases in mortgage interest rates 
investments 
investment income increased in and in primarily because of increases in yields 
investment gains in  and were realized as part of the ongoing management of the investment portfolio for the purpose of improving performance 
agent retention 
the amounts retained by agents  as a percentage of premiums from agents  were  and in the years  and  respectively 
amounts retained by title agents are based on contracts between agents and the title underwriters of the company 
the percentage that amounts retained by agents bears to agent revenues may vary from year to year because of the geographical mix of agent operations and the volume of title revenues 
selected cost ratios by segment 
the following table shows employee costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of related title and real estate information operating revenues for the last three years 
employee costs other expenses title rei these two categories of expenses are discussed below 
employee costs 
employee costs for the combined business segments increased in and in the number of persons employed by the company at december   and was   and  respectively 
the decrease in staff in was primarily the result of reductions in existing operations in response to decreased volumes 
these reductions were offset by acquisitions and expansion in national marketing and technology operations 
in the increase was primarily the result of acquisitions  increased rei volume and the expansion of the company s technology and national marketing operations 
in the rei segment  employee costs and cost ratios increased in primarily due to a shift in focus to provide more post closing services to lenders 
these services are considerably more labor intensive 
certain rei startup operations also increased expenses 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the combined business segments increased in and in the overall increase in other operating expenses for the combined business segments in was in new offices  rent  search fees and provisions for regulatory actions brought against the company

the year also included a million charge resulting from a lawsuit settlement in an rei operation 
other operating expenses also include title plant expenses  travel  delivery costs  telephone  supplies and policy forms 
most of these expenses follow  to varying degrees  the changes in transaction volume and revenues 
the company s labor and certain other operating costs are sensitive to inflation 
to the extent inflation causes increases in the prices of homes and other real estate  premium revenues are also increased 
premiums are determined in part by the insured values of the transactions handled by the company 
title losses 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title premiums  fees and other revenues  were  and in  and  respectively 
the continued improvement in industry trends in claims and increases in refinancing transactions  which result in lower loss exposure  have led to lower loss ratios in recent years 
income taxes 
the provision for federal and state income taxes represented effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
the effective rate was higher primarily due to state income taxes which were proportionately higher in relation to taxable income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion below about the company s risk management strategies includes forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties 
management s projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of the company s market rate sensitive instruments should certain potential changes in market rates occur  is presented below 
while the company believes that the potential market rate changes are reasonably possible  actual results could differ 
the company s only material market risk in investments in financial instruments is in its debt securities portfolio

the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities at december  was million 
debt securities at december  mature  according to their contractual terms  as follows actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized fair cost value omitted in one year or less   after one year through five years   after five years through ten years   after ten years   mortgage backed securities   the company believes its investment portfolio is diversified and expects no material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities it holds 
investments made by the company are not collateralized 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by agencies of the us government 
based on the company s debt securities portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million  or  in the fair value of its portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would only be realized upon the sale of the investments
