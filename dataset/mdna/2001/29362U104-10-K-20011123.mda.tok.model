entegris primarily derives its revenue from the sale of products to the microelectronics industry and recognizes sales upon the shipment of such goods to customers 
cost of sales includes polymers and purchased components  manufacturing personnel  supplies and fixed costs related to depreciation and operation of facilities and equipment 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers and are served through various subsidiaries and sales and distribution relationships in the united states  asia and europe

for example  the fiscal year ended august  is referred to as fiscal or 
in the second half of fiscal  the semiconductor industry began to recover from an industry downturn 
this recovery  which continued through the second quarter of fiscal  led to greatly improved net sales and profitability 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented deterioration in market conditions  with rapidly falling rates of factory utilization and reduced capital spending 
as a consequence  the company reported falling sales and earnings in the latter half of fiscal effective august   the company changed its method of accounting for its domestic inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method

all adjustments which management considers necessary for the fair presentation of the unaudited information have been included in the quarters presented 
from mid through the second quarter of fiscal  the company reported steadily improving net sales  primarily resulting from improved market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
as sales grew  gross profits and margins improved due to improved utilization of production capacity  and often a more favorable product sales mix 
during the last two quarters of  the company s sales fell dramatically as the global semiconductor industry experienced historic lows in factory utilization  which led to industry capital spending cutbacks 
the company experienced lower gross profits and margins as sales dropped by and sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal net income in the first quarter of fiscal included a million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of a portion of the company s investment in metron stock 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pretax charge of million related to the termination of a distribution agreement 
net income in the third quarter of included a million pretax charge in connection with its decision to close two facilities 
our quarterly results of operations have been  and will likely continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  a number of which are beyond the company s control 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from operating activities  long term loans  lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short term lines of credit 
in fiscal  entegris raised capital via an initial public offering 
operating activities 
cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
income from operations was the primary component of cash flow generated by operations in all years 
in fiscal  the company also benefited from the lower working capital requirements associated with falling second half sales  principally due to an accounts receivable decline of million 
inventories rose million as the company increased its safety stock of certain critical resins and built its inventories of fluid handling components used in the production of fluid handling products 
working capital stood at million at august  investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
acquisition of property and equipment totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significant capital expenditures in related principally to building our manufacturing capabilities for mm products  tooling for new products  investments in the company s e business initiatives  and the continued upgrading and integration of information systems 
the company expects capital expenditures of approximately to million during fiscal  consisting mainly of spending on manufacturing equipment  tooling and information systems 
the company completed four acquisitions in fiscal in march  the company acquired the fluid handling component product line of a japanese company for million 
patents and goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded in connection with the transaction 
in may  the company completed its acquisition of nt international  which designs and manufactures patented ultrahigh purity flow and pressure measurement sensors and controllers  for a cash payment of million 
identifiable intangible assets  including patents  and goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded in connection with the transaction 
in the fourth quarter  the company completed the acquisition of atcor corporation and the operating assets of critical clean solutions  inc which provide precision cleaning systems  products and services to the semiconductor industry  for cash payments totaling of million 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded in connection with the transactions 
the company made net purchases of million of available for sale securities classified as short term investments in financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively  while cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal in  the company recorded proceeds of million in connection with common shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
payments on long term borrowings totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  entegris completed a registered underwritten initial public offering ipo  receiving net proceeds of million after underwriting and issuance costs 
a portion of the ipo proceeds was used to eliminate domestic short term borrowings and retire million in long term debt and capital lease obligations 
the company repurchased common shares for million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these shares were acquired in connection with the redemption of common stock from the company s employee stock ownership plan and  in  the repurchase of  common shares as part of a  share repurchase authorization made by the company s board of directors in the first quarter of fiscal as of august   the company s sources of available funds comprised million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and various credit facilities 
entegris has unsecured revolving credit commitments with two commercial banks with aggregate borrowing capacity of million  with no borrowings outstanding at august  and lines of credit with six international banks which provide for borrowings of currencies for our overseas subsidiaries  equivalent to an aggregate million 
borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit were million at august  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria for intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
immediately 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million  million and none for  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statement no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on the company s financial statements at the date of this report 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is evaluating sfas no 
to determine the impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
euro conversion on january   the european union established fixed conversion rates and adopted the euro as its new common legal currency 
at that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges simultaneously with the legacy currencies of the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during this transition period  parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
the company is modifying its information technology systems to permit transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and provide for the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
in addition  the company is evaluating issues involving introduction of the euro and whether certain existing contracts will need to be modified 
currency risks and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
based on current information and assessments  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris s principal market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s current exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
most of its outstanding debt at august  carried fixed rates of interest 
all of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are debt instruments with remaining maturities of months or less 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the sale of products from the united states when such sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the cash flows and earnings of foreign based operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
impact of inflation the company s financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of polymers  its primary raw material  was essentially unchanged from one year ago 
entegris expects the cost of resins to remain stable in the foreseeable future 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose modestly in fiscal moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal item a
