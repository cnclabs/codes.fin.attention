the company is a leading national provider of comprehensive hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services 
the company operates primarily in the commercial and industrial hvac markets and performs most of its services within manufacturing plants  office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  and healthcare  education and government facilities

results of operations year ended december  in thousands revenues    cost of services    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    goodwill amortization    restructuring charges  operating income    other expense  net    reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net  income loss before income taxes    income tax expense    net income loss    compared to revenues revenues increased million or to billion in compared to the revenue growth was comprised of approximately internal growth and for acquisitions that are included in the company s results for the full year of approximately of the revenue growth resulted from the company s ability to increase volume by subcontracting portions of projects to other contractors 
of the internal growth rate compared to last year  approximately one half of this internal growth was attributable to the company s largest single operation 
this growth represented substantial increases in volume at this operation which did not result in commensurate increases in profitability due to scarce technical and skilled labor and customer scheduling and site restrictions related to strong business conditions 
the company has experienced these kinds of challenges at numerous other operations as well  and believes they reflect high levels of activity and capacity constraints for the construction industry in general 
as a result  management is placing less emphasis on revenue growth and more on operations  cash flow  efficiency and profit margin improvements for across all operations 
it is likely  therefore  that the company will experience flat to slower revenue growth in future periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will lead to improved profit margins in the near term 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in during  the company experienced disappointing results from certain locations due to execution shortfalls on projects and weak performance at several locations relating to ongoing turnaround efforts 
during  the company experienced significant execution shortfalls on certain projects at its largest operation  and at an operating location on the west coast  and at a location in the southeast 
these execution shortfalls resulted from difficulty in obtaining quality skilled and technical labor in certain markets  scheduling changes imposed by the customers and poor pricing and estimating by two previous operating managers 
the company also experienced weak operating performance at several locations relating to ongoing turnaround efforts and execution difficulties 
the company has decided to cease operating at or sell eight of these locations which reported a combined negative gross profit of million during gross profit in was also reduced  to a lesser extent  by the company s e commerce activities which were abandoned in the fourth quarter of the costs associated with these decisions are included in the restructuring charges discussed below 
the remaining decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from increased labor costs  pricing pressures in certain markets and scheduling and efficiency challenges associated with labor availability and productivity at the high levels of activity at most of our operations 
the company has also increased the amount of activity it subcontracts to third parties 
pricing to the company s customers of such subcontracted work generally carries lower margins than the company s self performed work 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased from in to in this increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the inclusion in of results of companies acquired in that have higher sg a as a percentage of revenues than the rest of the company s operations 
these acquisitions included outbound services where the company incurred significantly higher sg a to support expansion of its e commerce activities 
during the th quarter of  the company decided to cease its e commerce activities at outbound  and costs associated with this decision are included in restructuring charges as discussed below 
the company has also increased corporate and regional office spending to support the requirements of a larger organization  and to increase its efforts to obtain more national account and energy project business 
in addition  as discussed above  the company has experienced weak performance at several locations related to turnaround efforts and execution difficulties  and these companies have realized a disproportionate amount of sg a as compared to their revenues 
during the latter part of  the company identified certain accounts receivable that were deemed uncollectible and written off 
this necessitated increased provisions for bad debt in sg a  which also contributed to the company s higher sg a as a percentage of revenues 
restructuring charges during  the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately million primarily associated with restructuring efforts at certain underperforming operations and its decision to cease its e commerce activities at outbound services  a subsidiary of the company 
as announced by the company in the third quarter of  management performed an extensive review of its operations during the second half of as part of this review  management decided to cease operating at three locations  sell five operations including two smaller satellite operations  and merge two companies into other operations 
these actions are substantially complete except that the company is seeking buyers for two operations it is holding for sale 
the company anticipates that these operations will be sold during the first half of the aggregate results for related to the operations and activities included in the restructuring charges were revenues of million and operating losses of million 
the restructuring charges are primarily non cash and include goodwill impairments of approximately million and the writedown of other long lived assets of approximately million 
the remaining restructuring items primarily include severance and lease termination costs 
severance costs relate to the termination of approximately employees including certain corporate personnel and the management and employees of certain underperforming locations  and to the departure of the company s former chief executive officer 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased million  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to the increase in interest expense related to additional borrowings and consideration paid for companies acquired in reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net during  the company recorded a non cash charge of approximately million primarily related to the impairment of certain non operating assets 
these assets primarily related to notes receivable from former business owners that were collateralized by shares of the company s stock 
this charge also included an impairment of approximately million to the company s minority investment in two entities associated with the distribution and implementation of high end engineering and design software 
these entities have ceased operations 
also included in this charge was a gain of approximately million on the reduction of the company s subordinated note payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this former owner 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to for the company reported income tax expense of million for related to its pre tax loss of million primarily due to the writedown of non deductible goodwill associated with the company s restructuring activities 
the company s provision for income taxes also differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
compared to revenues revenues increased million  or  to billion in compared to the increase in revenues over the prior year is primarily due to the acquisition of purchased companies in and  however  the company experienced lower internal revenue growth in the latter part of fiscal as compared to previous periods 
the company believes that this is primarily attributable to a slowing in the growth of the construction industry due to shortages in both labor and specialty building materials  which in turn impacted hvac installations 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to the increase in gross profit is primarily due to the acquisitions described above 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in this decrease primarily resulted from the change in classification of certain costs from sg a to cost of services 
these costs relate to activities that directly support project or service work 
management believes this revised presentation better aligns the presentation of cost of services and sg a across all of our acquired operations 
excluding the effect of this change in classification for of approximately million  gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained relatively unchanged at in versus in during  the company experienced increased gross profit margins from strong performances in commercial and industrial markets in the northeast  phoenix and orlando as well as operating synergies achieved between its western michigan companies 
however  in the latter part of fiscal the company has experienced lower internal revenue growth as a result of construction industry capacity issues as discussed above 
in addition  there has been a shift in the mix of installation projects to higher labor intensive projects with lower gross profit percentages  pricing competition in certain markets and execution shortfalls and inefficiencies as the company sought stronger revenue growth levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million in compared to most of this increase was related to purchased companies along with an increase in corporate personnel and corporate office expenses commensurate with the increase in the number of acquired companies 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in this decrease is primarily attributable to the change in classification of certain costs as described above 
excluding the effect of this change in classification for of approximately million  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from for to for this increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from lower internal revenue growth as discussed above and increased healthcare costs under the company s self insured medical plan 
sg a for includes million of salaries and benefits paid to the former owners of the pooled companies which the former owners contractually agreed would not continue following their acquisition by comfort systems 
operating income operating income increased million  or  to million in compared to primarily due to the addition of purchased companies 
as a percentage of revenues  operating income decreased from in to in the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues resulted from issues discussed above 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased million  or  to million in compared to primarily due to the increase in interest expense related to the acquisition of the purchased companies 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to for the company s provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  or an increase of million over the prior year 
this improvement primarily results from lengthier payment cycles on accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and from faster billing by the company for its project work while maintaining the same average days to collect receivables once billed 
cash provided by operations for was million and cash used in operations in was million 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily in connection with purchases of property and equipment for million 
cash flows used in investing activities for and were million and million  respectively 
the uses of cash in and were primarily for the acquisition of purchased companies 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was primarily attributable to net payments on long term debt of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million and was due primarily to net borrowings of long term debt which were used to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million and was primarily attributable to the million received from the second public offering and net borrowings of long term debt of million  which were primarily used to fund acquisitions 
revolving credit facility the company amended its revolving credit facility the credit facility or the facility provided by bank one  texas  na bank one and other banks the bank group in march as amended  the credit facility provides the company with a revolving line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of net accounts receivable 
the facility decreases to the lesser of million or of net accounts receivable as of december   and to the lesser of million or of net accounts receivable as of june  borrowings under the facility are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets other than real estate  and the shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the credit facility expires on january   at which time all amounts outstanding are due 
the company has a choice of two interest rate options under the facility 
under one option  the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank one s prime rate 
an additional margin of to is then added to the higher of these two rates 
under the other interest rate option  borrowings bear interest based on designated short term eurodollar rates which generally approximate london interbank offered rates or libor plus to 
the additional margin for both options depends on the ratio of the company s debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined 
commitment fees of to per annum  also depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda  are payable on the unused portion of the facility 
the credit facility prohibits payment of dividends by the company  limits certain non bank group debt  and restricts outlays of cash by the company relating to certain investments  capital expenditures  vehicle leases  acquisitions and subordinate debt 
the credit facility also provides for the maintenance of certain levels of shareholder equity and ebitda  and for the maintenance of certain ratios of the company s ebitda to interest expense and debt to ebitda 
under the terms of the credit facility that were in effect as of june and september   the company was in violation of certain of the facility s financial balance and ratio requirements 
the bank group waived these violations 
the restrictions and financial balance and ratio requirements currently effective under the facility allow for performance during the first and second quarters of consistent with the company s results in recent quarters  excluding restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 
the facility s restrictions and requirements then call for improvement from recent performance levels in the third and fourth quarters of and on a quarterly basis in the facility also prohibits repurchase of the company s stock and has relatively tight approval requirements on acquisitions 
the facility s requirements reflect tighter restrictions  greater specificity and smaller allowable variances on most financial balances and ratios than is typical for such agreements due to the company s weaker results in while management believes its restructuring efforts and operating strategies along with general market conditions in the commercial industrial hvac and building automation controls industry will enable the company to meet the facility s requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
management intends to seek more flexible terms under its borrowing relationships as its results and credit market conditions allow 
as of december   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had incurred interest expense at an average rate of approximately for the year ended december  the credit facility s interest rate terms as summarized above are effective as of march  and currently result in an all in floating interest rate under the facility s libor option of approximately 
as of december   the company also had million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility  and unused borrowing capacity under the facility of million 
as of march   million in borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under the facility  and million in unused capacity was available 
notes to affiliates and former owners subordinated notes were issued to former owners of certain purchased companies as part of the consideration used to acquire their companies 
these notes had an outstanding balance of million as of december  of these notes  million bear interest  payable quarterly  at a weighted average interest rate of and million are non interest bearing 
in addition  million of these notes are convertible by the holders into shares of the company s common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
the originally scheduled maturities of the subordinated notes are million in  million in  million in  and million in as a result of the company s covenant violations in under the credit facility  the bank group required that originally scheduled principal payments to subordinate debt holders be suspended 
this requirement took effect in october in march  the company entered into amended agreements with subordinate debt holders representing million in principal  including all the principal originally scheduled to be paid through these amended agreements allow for partial payments against certain originally scheduled payment amounts  defer remaining principal balances to april  and increase the interest rate on this debt to per annum  payable quarterly 
as a result of these amended agreements  the company s annual maturities of subordinate debt are now million in  million in  and million in stock repurchases on october   the company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to buy up to million shares of its common stock 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares at a cost of approximately million 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares at a cost of approximately million 
the company does not expect further share repurchases under this program for the foreseeable future 
outlook the company anticipates that available borrowings under its credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s normal working capital and capital expenditure needs 
as noted above  the company has agreed to relatively tight restrictions under the credit facility 
if the company violates any of these restrictions  it will be required to negotiate new terms with its banks 
there can be no assurance that in that event  the company will receive satisfactory new terms from its banks  or that if the company needs additional financing  that such financing can be secured when needed or on terms the company deems acceptable 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  the company expects its revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  the company s volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses  retention of key management  a national downturn or one or more regional downturns in construction  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with debt financing  seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems and the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed price contract 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to integrate the companies it has acquired 
these businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results of the company because  among other reasons  the company s subsidiary operations were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
the existing senior management at many of the company s subsidiary operations is generally comprised of former owners who committed to stay with their operations after acquisition 
certain of these individuals have suffered losses in the company stock or have lower incomes than they averaged when they owned their former businesses 
further  former owners generally have noncompetition obligations that expire on the fifth anniversary of their date of acquisition 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to retain these individuals or find suitable replacements if such individuals leave the company 
the failure to retain or replace such management on a timely basis could negatively impact results from operations at such locations 
key elements of the company s strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability of the individual businesses and to continue to expand the operations of these businesses 
the company s level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside the company s control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for the company s services 
recently acquired businesses also involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention and failure to retain various personnel of the acquired business 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to their acquisition 
any of these risks  or a combination of them  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems by the company requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
in addition  the company depends on the senior management of the businesses it acquires and regional and corporate management to remain committed to the success of the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain and increase its productivity and profitability is also affected by its ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet the company s service requirements  and to retain senior management in acquired businesses and at the corporate and regional level 
the company has a substantial amount of debt that could limit its ability to fund future working capital needs and increase its exposure during adverse economic conditions 
such indebtedness could increase vulnerability to adverse operational performance and economic and industry conditions  limit the ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or industry  place the company at a disadvantage compared to a competitor that has less debt 
such indebtedness  together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments  could limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
hvac systems are also subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future 
the company s failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the company s future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  the increasing supply of tradable stock  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
the company is not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the company s debt with fixed interest rates consists of capital leases  convertible subordinated notes  subordinated notes and various other notes payable 
the company s debt with variable interest rates consists entirely of its revolving credit facility 
the following table presents principal amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december thereafter fair value liabilities long term debt variable rate debt   average interest rate fixed rate debt     average interest rate
