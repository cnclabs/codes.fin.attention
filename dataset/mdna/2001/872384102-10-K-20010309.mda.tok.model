material period to period variances in the consolidated statements of income are discussed under results of operations 
the financial condition and liquidity section analyzes cash flows and financial position 
discussion included in other matters addresses key trends  future plans and contingencies 
throughout these discussions  management addresses items that are reasonably likely to materially affect future liquidity or earnings 
through its ownership of the downstream segment and the upstream segment  the partnership operates in two segments  respectively refined products and lpgs transportation  and crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing 
the partnership s reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
the downstream segment is involved in the transportation  storage and terminaling of petroleum products and lpgs  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals and the fractionation of ngls 
revenues are derived from the transportation of refined products and lpgs  the storage and short haul shuttle transportation of lpgs at the mont belvieu  texas  complex  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
labor and electric power costs comprise the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment 
higher natural gas prices increase the cost of electricity used to power pump stations on the pipeline system 
operations are somewhat seasonal with higher revenues generally realized during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
the upstream segment is involved in the transportation  aggregation and marketing of crude oil and ngls  and the distribution of lube oils and specialty chemicals 
revenues are earned from the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil and ngls  and the distribution of lube oils and specialty chemicals principally in oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of purchasing and aggregating crude oil along its own and third party gathering and pipeline systems and arranging the necessary logistics for the ultimate sale of crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
operations of this segment are included from november   the date of its acquisition from defs 
on july   the company completed its acquisition of arco  for million  which included million of acquisition related costs 
the purchase included arco s percent ownership interest in seaway 
the partnership assumed arco s role as operator of this pipeline 
the company also acquired arco s crude oil terminal facilities in cushing and midland  texas  including the line transfer and pumpover business at each location  an undivided ownership interest in both the rancho pipeline and the basin pipeline  both of which are operated by another joint owner and the receipt and delivery pipelines known as the west texas trunk system  located around the midland terminal 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method for accounting purposes

the increase in income provided by the upstream segment was comprised of a million increase in margin  a million increase in other operating revenues and million of equity earnings of seaway  partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses excluding purchases of crude oil and petroleum products and a million increase in interest expense 
net income of the downstream segment decreased million from the prior year primarily due to a million increase in costs and expenses and a million increase in interest expense net of capitalized interest  partially offset by a million increase in operating revenues 
for the year ended december   the partnership reported net income of million  compared with a net loss of million for year ended december  the net loss in included an extraordinary charge of million for early extinguishment of debt  net of million allocated to minority interest 
excluding the extraordinary loss  net income would have been million for year ended december  the million increase in income before the loss on debt extinguishment resulted from a million increase in income provided by the upstream segment  which was acquired effective november   and a million increase in income provided by the downstream segment 
the increase in income provided by the downstream segment resulted primarily from a million increase in operating revenues  partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses and a million decrease in other income net

compared to operating revenues for the year ended increased to million from million for the year ended this million increase resulted from a million increase in lpgs transportation revenues  a million increase in other operating revenues and a million increase in revenues generated from mont belvieu operations 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in refined products transportation revenues 
refined products transportation revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of a decrease in total refined products volumes delivered 
motor fuel volumes delivered decreased by million barrels and distillate volumes delivered decreased by million barrels due primarily to a local refinery expansion in the west memphis market and unfavorable price differentials in the midwest market area 
natural gasoline volumes delivered declined million barrels due primarily to the expiration of a contract in late for deliveries to the chicago area  along with unfavorable processing and blending economics in the chicago market area 
these decreases were primarily offset by a million barrel increase in jet fuel volumes delivered due to continued strong demand in the chicago market area and at the cincinnati airport that is supplied by the partnership 
the partnership deferred recognition of approximately million of revenue during the year ended december   with respect to potential refund obligations for rates charged in excess of the ppi index while its application for market based rates is under review by ferc

strong economic demand coupled with lower refinery production resulted in a million barrel increase in jet fuel volumes delivered and a million barrel increase in distillate volumes delivered 
jet fuel volumes delivered also benefited as a result of new military supply agreements that became effective in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a million barrel decrease in motor fuel volumes delivered due to unfavorable midwest price differentials and reduced refinery production received into the ark la tex system and a million barrel decrease in natural gasoline volumes delivered attributable to lower feedstock and blending demand 
additionally  mtbe volumes delivered decreased million barrels as a result of the partnership canceling its tariffs to midwest destinations  effective july  this action was taken with the consent of mtbe shippers as a result of lower demand for mtbe transportation caused by changing blending economics  and resulted in increased pipeline capacity and tankage available for other products

market and regulatory environment rates of interstate oil pipeline companies are currently regulated by the ferc  primarily through an index methodology  whereby a pipeline company is allowed to change its rates based on the change from year to year in the producer price index for finished goods less ppi index 
in the alternative  interstate oil pipeline companies may elect to support rate filings by using a cost of service methodology  competitive market showings market based rates or agreements between shippers and the oil pipeline company that the rate is acceptable settlement rates 
on may   the downstream segment filed an application with the ferc requesting permission to charge market based rates for substantially all refined products transportation tariffs 
along with its application for market based rates  the downstream segment filed a petition for waiver pending the ferc s determination on its application for market based rates  of the requirements that would otherwise have been imposed by the ferc s regulations requiring the downstream segment to reduce its rates in conformity with the ppi index 
on june   the ferc granted the waiver stating that it was temporary in nature and that the downstream segment would be required to make refunds  with interest  of all amounts collected under rates in excess of the ppi index ceiling level after july   if the downstream segment s application for market based rates was ultimately denied 
as a result of the refund obligation potential  the partnership has deferred all revenue recognition of rates charged in excess of the ppi index 
on december   the amount deferred for possible rate refund  including interest totaled approximately million 
on july   the ferc issued an order granting the downstream segment market based rates in certain markets and set for hearing the downstream segment s application for market based rates in the little rock  arkansas  shreveport arcadia  louisiana  cincinnati dayton  ohio  and memphis  tennessee  destination markets and the shreveport  louisiana  origin market

on january   the presiding administrative law judge assigned to the hearing determined that the offer of settlement provided resolution of issues set for hearing in the downstream segment pending case in a fair and reasonable manner and in the public interest and certified the offer of settlement and recommended it to the ferc for approval 
the certification of the settlement is currently before the ferc 
the partnership believes that the administrative law judge s decision in this matter will be upheld by the ferc 
the settlement  if it is approved by ferc  will require the downstream segment to withdraw the application for market based rates to the little rock  arkansas  destination market and the arcadia  louisiana  destination in the shreveport arcadia  louisiana  destination market 
the downstream segment also has agreed to recalculate rates to these destination markets to conform with the ppi index from july   and make appropriate refunds 
the refund obligation under the proposed settlement as of december   would be million 
effective july   the downstream segment established settlement rates with certain shippers of lpgs under which the rates in effect on june   would not be adjusted for a period of either two or three years 
other lpgs transportation tariff rates were reduced pursuant to the ppi index approximately  effective july  effective july   the downstream segment canceled its tariff for deliveries of mtbe into the chicago market area reflecting reduced demand for transportation of mtbe into such area 
the mtbe tariffs were canceled with the consent of mtbe shippers and resulted in increased pipeline capacity and tankage available for other products 
on october   the partnership received a settlement notice from arco for payment of a net aggregate amount of approximately million in post closing adjustments related to the purchase of the arco assets 
a large portion of the requested adjustment relates to arco s indemnity for payment of accrued income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the partnership may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
the partnership has no foreign exchange risks 
risk management policies have been established by the risk management committee to monitor and control these market risks 
the risk management committee is comprised of senior executives of the company 
the partnership mitigates exposure to commodity price fluctuations by maintaining a balanced position between crude oil purchases and sales 
as a hedging strategy to manage crude oil price fluctuations  the partnership enters into futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange  and makes limited use of other derivative instruments 
it is the partnership s general policy not to acquire crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes  however  the partnership may take limited speculative positions to capitalize on crude oil price fluctuations 
any contracts held for trading purposes or speculative positions are accounted for using the mark to market method 
under this methodology  contracts are adjusted to market value  and the gains and losses are recognized in current period income 
market risks associated with commodity derivatives were not material at december  at december   the downstream segment had outstanding million principal amount of senior notes due  and million principal amount of senior notes due collectively the senior notes 
at december  and  the estimated fair value of the senior notes was approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the partnership had million outstanding under a variable interest rate revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate is based on the partnership s option of either the lender s base rate plus a spread or libor plus a spread in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bimonthly  quarterly or semi annually 
utilizing the balances of variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   and assuming market interest rates increase basis points  the potential annual increase in interest expense is approximately million 
on july   the partnership entered into a three year swap agreement to partially hedge its exposure on the new variable rate credit facilities 
the swap agreement is based on the notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  the partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest of and will receive a floating rate based on the three month usd libor rate 
at december   the estimated fair value of the swap agreement was a loss of approximately million 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative at its inception 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the statement of income  and requires the company to formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of the hedge transaction to receive hedge accounting 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
overall hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly 
any changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas and measured based on the cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the cumulative changes in the estimated future cash flows of the hedged item  are recognized immediately in earnings 
the company has designated its swap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
adoption of sfas resulted in the recognition of approximately million of derivative liabilities on the partnership s balance sheet and million of hedging losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of partners capital  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  amounts were determined as of january  based on the market quote of the partnership s interest rate swap agreement
