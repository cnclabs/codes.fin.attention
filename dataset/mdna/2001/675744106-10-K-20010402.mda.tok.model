as the company expects that its overall average selling price will continue to decline over time due to product and geographic mix shift  as discussed above in net sales 
the company will need to continue to reduce its per unit production costs through increased automation  increased volume and reduced packaging costs in order to improve  or even to maintain  its gross margin percentage 
the company believes that the decline in average selling price  as sales of lower average selling price lenses marketed for daily replacement regimens increase  may exceed the rate of decline in production cost in the near term and accordingly  the company would expect continued pressure on its gross profit margins in the future for its products
