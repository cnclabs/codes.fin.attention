these statements appear throughout the form k and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for applications in oncology and regenerative medicine  and research tools for drug discovery 
our product development programs are based upon three patented core technologies telomerase  human embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from license and research agreements with collaborators 
in addition  we receive license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreements with various diagnostic and research tool collaborators 
we recognize revenue from the license and research agreements with collaborators as the related research and development costs are incurred under the collaborative agreements 
in january and february  the company extended its three way license and research collaboration agreement with pharmacia and kyowa hakko  respectively 
the agreement extends the research and compound selection periods one additional year each  to march and march  respectively 
in  we received million from pharmacia and million from kyowa hakko as a result of the extensions 
in march  we sold a total of  shares of our common stock and  warrants to purchase our common stock to a single investor for million 
we structured the sale of securities in two parts 
we priced the first million of common stock at per share  and  warrants are exercisable at per share 
we priced the remaining million of common stock at per share  and the remaining  warrants are exercisable at per share 
the common stock and the stock underlying the warrants are not registered for resale and are subject to a two year prohibition on sale by agreement 
as of december   all of the warrants were outstanding 
during the first quarter of  institutional investors exercised series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and series c warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in total  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of these warrants 
in the first quarter of  an institutional investor converted an aggregate principal amount of million plus accrued interest of series c convertible debentures into  shares of our common stock 
in addition  an institutional investor converted an aggregate principal amount of million of series b convertible debentures into  shares of our common stock 
in june  we sold million in series d zero coupon convertible debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to an institutional investor 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
we can convert the debentures at any time if our common stock has traded at a certain premium to the fixed conversion price for five consecutive trading days 
if unconverted  the debentures have a maturity date of june  the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock is exercisable at per share at the option of the holder until december  in september  we entered into an agreement with an institutional investor for an equity financing facility covering the sale of up to million of our common stock over months 
the shares will be sold at our discretion at a discount to the then current market price of our common stock on the day of sale 
we control the amount and timing of each sale of stock 
in october  we sold million of our common stock under the equity line financing facility 
the financing was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration previously filed with the securities and exchange commission in april in january  we and pharmacia agreed to terminate our license and research collaboration agreement 
pharmacia returned all product rights for telomerase inhibitors to us 
we plan to continue our development work on compounds that inhibit telomerase for applications in cancer chemotherapy 
the extension agreement with kyowa hakko remains unchanged 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
results of operations revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in  and represented research support payments from our collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia 
declining revenues in were a result of reduced research funding from kyowa hakko as contractually agreed in increase in revenues in were a result of the extension of our three way agreement with kyowa hakko and pharmacia terminated in january 
we recognize revenue under collaboration agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
we received annual funding payments of million  none and million under the kyowa hakko agreement in  and  respectively 
we received funding payments totaling million each in fiscal  and under the pharmacia agreement 
we expect revenues from collaborative agreements to decrease in as compared to as a result of regaining our rights from pharmacia 
we receive license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreements with various diagnostic and research tool collaborators 
we received a license fee payment of  in under our product marketing agreement with clontech 
we did not receive any license fee payments in or in fiscal  we received  in royalties on the sale of diagnostic kits to the research use only market from intergen  kyowa medex  roche diagnostics and pharmingen compared to  received in fiscal and  received in fiscal in  we also recognized  in shared profits from sales of cell based research products from clontech compared to  in fiscal sales of these cell based research products began in september research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased contract research expenses of million  increased license fees for research technology of  and higher scientific supplies of  the increase in from was primarily the result of the amortization of the research funding obligation to the roslin institute of million  increased license fees for research technology of million and increased personnel related costs of  we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as a result of the continued development of our therapeutic and diagnostic programs 
acquired research expenses acquired research expenses were the result of the acquisition of roslin bio med in may we used the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the purchase price between the acquired basic research in the form of a license to the nuclear transfer technology  the research agreement with the roslin institute and the net tangible assets of roslin bio med 
we expensed the value of the nuclear transfer technology of million as acquired research expense and capitalized the value of the research agreement of million as an intangible asset 
the total purchase price of million also included acquisition costs of million 
the license to the nuclear transfer technology was the only significant asset of roslin bio med 
we intend to enhance the research and development of the nuclear transfer technology by combining it with our other technology platforms 
before we can enter into clinical trials for a potential commercial application  we must expand the research and development of the combined technology platforms 
future products  if any  may take several years to develop and commercialize and will require substantial additional funds 
we may never be able to create a commercial product from the nuclear transfer technology 
although we have the right to sublicense the nuclear transfer technology  we expect any future collaborations or sublicenses to fund future research and development and not recover the cost of the basic nuclear transfer technology that we acquired 
we are using this technology for one research project 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use  and accordingly  have expensed the value of the acquired research technology at the time of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased business consulting expenses of million 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased business consulting expenses of  increased personnel related costs of  increased facilities maintenance costs of  and increased legal and accounting expenses of  interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in and was due to higher average cash and investment balances as a result of investing proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities in and interest earned in the future will depend on any future funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we also received  million and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other expense in and over was primarily the result of the various convertible debenture financings during and in connection with the issuance of series d convertible debentures in june  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in addition  we recorded the million value of the warrant issued with the series d convertible debentures as a charge to interest expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
at the end of  we adopted a new accounting principle as required by the financial accounting standards board 
this new principle required us to modify the way we calculated the interest expense recognized for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the closing date of the convertible debenture financing and the conversion price of the debentures 
we were required to apply this new accounting principle retroactively to the september series c convertible debenture issuance 
as a result of adopting this new accounting principle  we recognized million in imputed non cash interest expense and have recorded it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in connection with the issuance of series c convertible debentures in september  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in addition  we recognized  in interest expense related to a potential penalty on redemption up through the date our stockholders authorized the additional shares to be issued for the full conversion of the series c convertible debentures and the exercise of the series c warrants 
we determined the value of the series c warrants to be million 
we recorded this value as an increase to additional paid in capital with a related charge to interest expense 
in connection with the issuance of series b convertible debentures in june  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in december  we recorded approximately  in interest expense in connection with the sale of series a convertible debentures  for the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of the series a convertible debentures 
we recorded the series a convertible debentures at a discount and were amortizing the debentures to the redemption amount prior to the conversion of the debentures into common stock 
net loss losses before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net losses after cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss for was the net result of increased operating expenses  interest expense and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle which was offset by the decrease in acquisition costs 
the increase in net loss for was primarily the result of the charge for acquired research technology in connection with the acquisition of roslin bio med and the amortization of the research funding obligation to the roslin institute 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was primarily the result of the exercise of warrants  the sale of equity to a private investor and the sale of convertible debentures 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was primarily the result of the sale of convertible debentures in june and september net cash used in operations was million in and cash used in operations in was primarily the result of the net loss for the year of million offset partially by non cash charges including million of interest arising from the beneficial conversion feature of convertible debentures and the value of warrants issued with convertible debentures 
we expect that our net cash used in operations will increase in as a result of increased research and development expenditures 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment financing 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing from our equipment financing facility 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facility expires on october  we intend to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  then we will need to spend our own resources for equipment purchases 
we have agreed to fund scientific research at academic and research institutions  including the roslin institute 
under these research arrangements  we are obligated to make minimum annual payments of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we intend to continue to maintain and develop relationships with academic and research institutions 
in  kyowa hakko and pharmacia both extended their research funding commitment for an additional year 
we received million and million of additional funding from kyowa hakko and pharmacia  respectively  in as a result of the extension 
in january  we and pharmacia agreed to terminate the license and research collaboration agreement 
pharmacia returned all product rights for telomerase inhibitors to us 
we will seek further funding through other strategic collaborations  public or private equity financing  or other financing sources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about geron s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate and municipal notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currencies 
for the fiscal year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  the financial obligations of geron to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next five years 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
