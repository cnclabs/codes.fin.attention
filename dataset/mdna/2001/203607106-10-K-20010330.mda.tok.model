the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding an d assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial conditio n of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion an d analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financia l information and the company s consolidated financial statements and relate d notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references in th e discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to th e consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
net income and profitability net income and diluted earnings per share reached record highs in of million and  respectively 
compared to  net income rose whil e earnings per share were up 
the company s share repurchase progra m continued to benefit earnings per share growth  since its inception in the fal l of   shares or of shares outstanding have been bought back  th e most recent purchase having been made on june  subsequent to year end the repurchased shares were reissued in conjunction with the acquisition of th e citizens national bank of malone 
cash earnings per share diluted also reached record levels in  up t o 
cash or tangible return on assets roa for was versus nomina l roa at 
tangible return on equity roe for the year climbed percentage points over s level to  exceeding nominal roe by percentage points for the same period and placing the company s performance i n the top quartile of its regional peer banks 
the difference between cash an d nominal results reflects the contribution of the company s acquisitions on a n economic basis  which excludes the non cash impact of amortizing the premium s paid for the acquisitions 
many analysts and investors consider cash results a better measure of core profitability and value created for shareholders tha n nominal results 
s recurring or core earnings were up from last year to millio n after removing the impact of one time income and expense items 
items exclude d relate to investment gains and losses and expense associated with branc h properties no longer in use 
the primary factors explaining s improvement are explained in detail in th e remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows o net interest income full tax equivalent basis increased or million due to a million increase in average earning assets 
averag e loans grew million while average investments also grew million 
the growth in earning assets was funded by millio n more in average borrowings and million more in averag e deposits 
however  the net interest margin decreased by a significant basis points to on average 
o total noninterest income increased by million from t o million 
financial services accounted for million of th e improvement in noninterest income  with million being attributable t o the purchase of elias asset management eam on april  revenue s excluding net investment gains losses and the impact of branch propertie s no longer in use were up nicely for the sixth consecutive year t o approximately million in  a million improvement 
o noninterest expense or overhead rose million or in compare d to  or in excluding the million impact of the ea m purchase  noninterest expense was up million or in th e primary sources of the increase were personnel expense  up million o r  with the balance largely residing in higher data processing expens e and greater depreciation and equipment expense 
the bulk of these latte r increases reflect additional expenditures related to conversion of th e company s check processing operations to image processing during the secon d and third quarter of the year 
professional fees were also lower 
o loan loss provision expense rose million or over s level the full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge offs b y times  this margin serving as a precaution in the event the upstat e new york economy weakens after its long sustained period of relativ e economic health 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased basis points in to 
the higher level of provision was in part du e to what management believes to be two isolated and unusual commercial loa n charge offs in nonperforming loans decreased during to 
o f loans outstanding at year end compared to 
one year earlier 
o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased on e percentage point this year to as a result of an increased proportio n of tax exempt municipal investment holdings and continued effective ta x planning strategies 
the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability which ma y be compared to that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies  this group i s comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in asset s based on data through september  the most recently availabl e disclosure as provided by the federal reserve system 
through year to dat e september  the company s return on average assets roa was compared t o the peer norm of 
shareholder return on equity roe at for th e same period ranked higher than the peer norm of  placing it in the t h peer percentile 
the company s primary performance focus is on achieving return s to shareholders and is better measured by roe than roa 
for the full year  earnings per share diluted rose 
over to a record 
the first three quarters of at  
and 
per shar e exceeded the same quarters by   and  respectively 
fourt h quarter earnings per share at 
exceeded the same period by 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows at december percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning asset s loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid t o the company s depositors  interest on capital market and bank borrowings  an d dividends paid on the company s million in trust preferred stock 
ne t interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets an d the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalen t basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase over the prior year 
the increase was due both to higher earning asse t volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million while interest rate changes had an unfavorable impact of million 
with regard to the components of s net interest income  greater averag e earning assets of million helped contribute million of the million or rise in interest income  higher yields explain the remainder o f the increase 
average loans grew a total of million in  with th e most significant portion occurring in the first half of the year 
overal l interest and fees on loans climbed million or as a result of thi s growth and a basis point bp increase in loan yields to  which wa s caused by rising market rates during the latter part of and the first hal f of this rate environment also produced investment portfolio buying opportunitie s resulting in a million increase in average investments 
investmen t interest income in was million higher than the prior year as a resul t of the higher outstandings as well as an increase in the average investmen t yield from to 
rising market rates in the latter half of an d first half of increased the yield on new investments and were the primar y cause of the increase in average investment yield 
through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable t h peer bank percentile while the investment yield was in the most favorable t h percentile 
the average earning asset yield rose basis points to i n because of the aforementioned increase in investment and loan yields partially offset by a reduced mix of loans to earning assets 
the average rati o of loans to earning assets decreased from in to in as a consequence of increased investment opportunities and a slowing demand for ne w automobile purchases 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in largely attributable to a million increase in borrowings used to fun d purchases of investment securities and approximately of loan growth  an d million more in deposits 
approximately of the latter reflects highe r deposits from individuals  partnerships  and corporations  reflective of greate r checking account balances and our successful cd promotions  with the balanc e from increased deposits of municipalities 
higher average interest bearing funds contributed million of the million total rise in interest expense  with the balance caused by an increas e in the average cost of funds  which as a percentage of earning assets ros e by basis points bps to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits rose bps to  due largely to across the board increases in deposit rate s beginning in the middle of and continuing throughout most of and a bp higher borrowing rate reflecting rising market rates 
overall  throug h september   the company s average cost of funds rate was slightly abov e the peer norm in the th peer bank percentile  compared to being in the t h percentile through september  the bp increase in the rate on average interest bearing deposits from t o  in addition to the bp increase in the average borrowed funds rate caused cbsi s net interest margin to decrease by basis points from i n to this year

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are of four primary types financia l services  comprised of personal trust  employee benefit trust  investment  an d insurance products  specialty products  largely electronic  and mortgage bankin g activities  general banking services related to loans  deposits and othe r activities typically provided through the branch network  and periodi c transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments o r other occasional events 
total noninterest income in increased by to million  largel y due to the addition of elias asset management eam in april 
combined revenues excluding investment gains and losses  were up strongly for the sixt h consecutive year to approximately million in  a million or improvement over fees from the financial services segment of noninterest income rose i n to million compared to growth in the prior year 
over the las t five years  financial services revenues have climbed at a compound annual growt h rate of nearly  and for as a whole  comprise over of tota l noninterest income  excluding net investment securities gains losses 
th e increase in s growth rate largely reflects the previously mentioned ea m acquisition  without which financial services revenues would have nonetheles s climbed 
overall  financial services contributed million or o f the company s pretax net income this year before allocation of indirec t corporate expense reflecting nearly a return on revenue 
in  the ne t income contribution was million or  with a return on revenue also o f assets under management from the company s several financial services businesse s reached billion in compared to million in the prior year largely reflective of the addition of elias asset management 
revenues an d assets under management from these financial segments are as follows o fees from personal trust services were million  up in a s compared to a increase in recurring trust fees excludin g periodic estate fees related to individual investment management account s and annual trust administration together representing of persona l trust income grew a combined

commissio n income from this source grew in to million  compared t o nominal growth in of 
theseproducts and services have been delivered since march of throug h the company s own broker dealer  community investment services  inc cisi  having been previously been provided in partnership with a thir d party which guided the company in becoming established in the busines s beginning in mid  primevest financial services  inc of saint cloud minnesota 
in late and in the fall of  cisi established tw o stand alone brokerage offices in lockport and jamestown  ny  respectively these offices are staffed with professionals attracted from large r brokerage companies  who have brought much of their books of business t o cisi 
during the last five years  commission income from the sale of mutual fund s and related products have grown at an annual compound growth rate of ove r 
assets under management of cisi reached million by year end up million or over the prior twelve months 
o community bank has long been in the business of selling creditor life an d disability insurance to installment and mortgage loan customers through it s branch system 
revenues from this activity  including the bank s annua l dividend from the new york state bankers life insurance subsidiary throug h which the creditor life insurance is written  plus commissions generated b y the sale of insurance products through the company s financial consultants amounted to  in  up over last year 
the latter insuranc e products are distributed through community financial services  inc cfsi established in mid with a focus on the sale of long term health car e and other selected insurance vehicles 
o lastly  revenues from elias asset management eam  purchased on april  reached million this year  up from million or nearly from the comparable nine month period in when eam was a n independently owned company 
its customer base is approximately individuals  followed by corporations  and largely for trusts foundations  endowments  and estates 
despite unfavorable market condition s during the year  as reflected by a decrease in the standard poor s index  total assets under management ended at million down 
this reflects net new business of in addition to its financial services businesses  another segment of th e company s noninterest income is its specialty products  which largely includ e electronic products and mortgage banking and servicing activities 
thes e activities in contributed of noninterest income  excluding ne t investment securities gains losses 
total revenues were million  up from million in  largely due to increased electronic product revenue s as discussed below 
over the last five years  specialty product revenues hav e grown at an annual compound growth rate of nearly 
o fees earned from electronic products reached million this year  up from this increase was primarily due to the company s visa tm affiliation  which rose to million  reflecting continued growth o f visa check card revenues climbing and atm surcharge income increasing to  visa merchant discount fees fell in o mortgage banking fees were  in  down from  in th e prior year 
the primary reason for the decrease was the sharp reduction i n loans sold to million from million in  when the purchas e money mortgage and refinancing market was much more favorable 
this chang e is reflected in a reduction in the incremental increase in mortgag e servicing rights from  in to  this year  partiall y offset by gains on loans sold of  this year versus a loss of  last year 
loan servicing fees were  in  up from th e previous year on a serviced loan portfolio of approximately million consisting of about  loans 
o thirdly  the company established a relationship in with a national third party leasing company  synergy resources of bloomington  minnesota which pays referral commissions on leases booked for cbna customers revenues  largely from small equipment leases  were  this year  dow n from s level of  customers may submit applications b y telephone  fax  or the internet 
the second and previously largest segment of the company s recurring noninteres t income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  whic h reached million in  up from the prior year 
this segmen t contributed of noninterest income  excluding net investment securities gain s losses 
the increase in these revenues is generally in the single digit rang e because they are largely dependent on deposit growth and expansion of service s provided through cbna s branch network 
however  the company s branc h acquisitions beginning in have resulted in a five year annual compoun d growth rate in these revenues of nearly 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  a growth rate compared to a growth rate in this year s improvement reflects a  increase in overdraft fees reflective of the full year impact of price increases which took place i n the fourth quarter of o general commissions and miscellaneous income at million were up in this increase is attributable to approximately  more i n canadian exchange revenues and  additional earnings on a service i n conjunction with sei investments  which sweeps the excess checkin g account deposits of commercial customers into an interest bearing overnigh t investment instrument 
income from periodic transactions in largely includes  in losse s taken on million in investment sales  with the net proceeds reinvested a t higher yields to achieve greater resulting cash flows than had the securitie s been held to maturity 
this amount compares to losses of  million las t year on a combined million in investment sales 
the investment gains an d losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of the company s activ e management of its investment portfolio to achieve a desirable total return and a targeted level of combined interest income and securities gains losses acros s financial market cycles 
other amounts of periodic income in were  compared to  i n the prior year  this was largely due to gains on the sale of branch property an d other miscellaneous assets in the normal course of business 
noninterest income  excluding transactions related to investment securities an d disposal of branch properties  as a percent of operating income was i n  an increase of percentage points from the prior year 
since  thi s ratio has risen percentage points from  resulting from a focuse d effort to raise product revenues less susceptible to interest rate fluctuation compared to peers as of september   this ratio increased to the t h peer percentile  up from the th percentile in in light of management s ongoing objective to grow noninterest income opportunities to develop new fee based products are actively pursued  includin g newly permitted activities under the financial modernization act  i n addition  emphasis continues on the collection of fees minimizing limitation o n waived fees for providing quality service 
in an effort to focus on an d accelerate growth of the company s financial service businesses  michael

excluding amortization of intangible assets which is a significant non cash expense for the company and virtuall y non existent for its peer group  cbsi s noninterest expense ratio was i n compared to for peers 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for over of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up as a result of the ea m acquisition versus rising in the remainder of the increases i n salary  benefit  and payroll tax expenses reflect modest annual merit awards fo r employees 
total full time equivalent staff at year end was versus at year end  down as the result of attrition and several cost savin g initiatives during the year 
these initiatives included consolidation of th e company s collection  indirect installment loan approval  mortgage servicing and first day deposit operations functions  all of which were previousl y performed in each of the canton and olean  ny operations or administrativ e centers 
nonpersonnel expense rose  or this year as opposed to a  o r increase in this was largely caused by increases in data processing up  or  depreciation on equipment  up  or  and offic e supplies  up  or 
these increases were partially offset by lowe r professional fees  down  or 
the bulk of the increase in dat a processing relates to an accounting classification change that now consider s processing charges related to the company s broker dealer as a separate expens e versus previously applying it against revenue 
depreciation on equipment ros e due to the full year impact of purchases of new computers replacements becaus e of required year upgrades  installation of check reader sorters for th e olean and canton  ny operations centers  and conversion to an image based chec k processing system for the northern markets of the company in mid implementation of the image system for the southern markets followed later i n the year  and depreciation on this phase will begin in most of th e remaining increases in these non personnel areas reflects additiona l expenditures some one time related to the conversion of the company s chec k processing operations to image processing 
the efficiency ratio is defined at two levels 
the nominal ratio is tota l overhead expense divided by operating income full tax equivalent net interes t income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses 
th e adjusted or recurring efficiency ratio additionally excludes one time expens e and intangible amortization a non cash expense as well as all one tim e noninterest income  over the last five years  these one time items have relate d to the disposal of branch properties 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
in  the nominal efficiency ratio decreased percentage points to while the recurring ratio decreased percentage points to 
managemen t believes it is more meaningful to use the recurring ratio to compare to nationa l norms  because as mentioned above  most of the company s peers do not hav e intangible expense to the significance that cbsi has 
on that basis  cbsi s ratio is more favorable than the peer bank ratio of based on dat a available as of september  the improvement in the efficiency rati o is a function of several factors an increase in net interest income due t o higher earning assets and reduced premium amortization on the company s cm o securities  steady progress in developing more sources of noninterest incom e cost recovery and penalty fees on the banking side of the business having th e greatest impact on the ratio  and persistent control of overhead expense excluding the company s financial services businesses  which by their natur e carry a higher efficiency ratio in  the efficiency ratio was for the year 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  managemen t maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminatin g inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed pee r comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement  targeted use o f outside consultants  and review of productivity enhancing technology 
thes e combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from future price increases an d higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit fro m economies of scale as it continues to grow 
specifically  the bank benefited fo r the entirety of from the creation of its broker dealer subsidiary durin g the first quarter of  which brought down the expense of processing mutua l funds and related products  and partially in from the overhead savings fro m the aforementioned conversion of the company s check processing operations t o image during the second and third quarter of this year 
also contributing t o better productivity and control during were consolidation of the company s collection  indirect installment loan approval  mortgage servicing  an d first day deposit operations functions  all of which were previously performe d in each of the canton and olean  ny operations or administrative centers

income and income taxes income before tax in was million  up over the prior year s amount 
when income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxabl e on a federal basis  s results rose by million or to million before tax 
the main reasons for improved pretax earnings were the favorable millio n increase in net interest income full tax equivalent basis related to stron g earning asset growth up or million on average  a million o r climb in noninterest income  excluding net securities gains losses  an d a  reduction in securities losses compared to the prior year se e investments section of this report 
these factors were partially offset by a million increase in overhead expense largely relating to the elia s asset management acquisition  and a million increase in loan los s provision expense as a result of two unusual and isolated commercial loans tha t were written down during the last half of the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased on e percentage point this year to 
the decrease resulted from effective ta x planning  principally because of increased purchases of tax exempt municipa l investments and other income during the year 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up from one year earlier this improvement reflects earnings for the year and the positive change i n market value adjustment mva of the bank s available for sale investments offset by dividends paid to shareholders and the cost of repurchasing  shares of cbu common stock during the company s stock buy back program under which  shares have been acquired as treasury stock  representin g of the shares outstanding prior to the inception of the program in lat e summer  reflects the company s belief that its common stock is an excellen t investment and that the financial markets are not fully valuing its stron g banking franchise 
excluding the mva and purchase of treasury stock in both and  capital rose by million or 
shares outstanding fell b y  during the year due to the aforementioned repurchase of stock offset b y the exercise of stock options 
subsequent to year end  the repurchased share s were reissued in conjunction with the acquisition of the citizens national ban k of malone 
despite the repurchase of stock  the ratio of tier i capital to assets or tie r i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  remains sound at  virtuall y unchanged from one year ago 
the total capital to risk weighted assets rati o decreased basis points during to as of year end compared to th e minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confiden t that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investo r perspectives 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented a n increase of over the prior year 
this growth largely reflects a two cen t per share increase in the quarterly common stock dividend beginning in the thir d quarter of from 
to 
this marks the ninth consecutive year o f dividend increases  which have resulted in an compound annual growth rat e over that time period 
raising the company s expected annualized dividend to per common shar e reflects management s confidence that earnings strength is sustainable and tha t capital can be maintained at a satisfactory level 
the dividend pay out rati o for the year was compared to and in and respectively  now at the mid point of the company s targeted pay out range fo r dividends on common stock of 
its pay out ratio has historically bee n strong relative to peers 
during the period  the pay out  includin g preferred dividends  ranged from the th to th percentile

loans the amounts of the bank s loans outstanding net of deferred loan fees or costs at the dates indicated are shown in the following table according to type o f loan as of december  real estate mortgages residential    commercial loans secured by    real estate farm    total    commercial  financial  and agricultural agricultural    commercial and financial    total    installment loans to individuals direct    indirect    student and other    total    other loans    gross loans    less unearned discounts  net loans    reserve for possible    loan losses loans  net of loan loss reserve    loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  reached a record  million a s of year end  up over million or compared to twelve month s earlier 
about of s growth came from branches acquired in mid from key bank  na and fleet bank  with a like amount coming from the branches net of three subsequently sold purchased from chase manhattan bank i n mid thus  more than half of the company s loan growth in reflecte d the markets opened by its strategic branch acquisitions over the last six years loan growth in was million or compared to million or in the company s predominant focus on the retail borrower enables its loa n portfolio to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding ar e oriented to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loa n basis 
over the last several years  the growth rate of cbsi s commercia l business loans has exceeded that of loans to individuals  and this secto r exhibits a high degree of diversification as well 
loans are typically fo r amounts under  with approximately of our customers representin g about of commercial loans outstanding 
slightly over thirty five percent o f our commercial portfolio is comprised of loans in excess of  th e portfolio contains no credit card receivables 
the overall yield on th e portfolio is in the attractive th peer percentile 
the nature of lending table below recasts the company s loan portfolio int o four major lines of business 
as previously discussed  much of the loa n growth relates to new business generated in markets where acquired branches ar e located 
the increase in business lending accounted for of the millio n in total loan growth in versus of s million increase 
a n increase in consumer direct loans contributed toward total growth this yea r versus in consumer indirect loans accounted for of this year s increase  down from in the prior year 
the decrease in direct and indirec t consumer loans reflects softening demand in the automotive industry 
lastly  th e share of this year s total loan increase for consumer mortgages was  up fro m s share of  reflective of the even greater success of the company s no closing cost product

the portfolio is broadly diversified by industry type  reflective of th e nature of the company s markets 
the largest share is service businesses followed by finance insurance real estate  retail trade an d agriculture forestry fishing each at  manufacturing and dealer floor plan s each at  and miscellaneous industries 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine and mobile home dealers increased modestly in outstandings ended the yea r or million higher  primarily resulting from growth in the bank s souther n region 
this compares to growth of or million in this portfoli o segment  of which relates to automobile lending of the vehicles ar e used versus new  constitutes of total loans outstanding  down onl y slightly from  but down from its peak of in a slowdown i n automobile sales during the latter half of primarily explains the reductio n in growth versus the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages i s predominantly fixed versus adjustable rate residential lending 
i t accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
growth during th e last two years million or in and million or i n is attributable to the attractiveness of the bank s no closing cos t mortgage product both for home purchase or refinancing as well as being a vehicle for consumers to term out higher cost credit card debt 
portfolio growt h is lower than it could have been due to a program which began in mid t o sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose o f this program  with sales of million in  million in an d million this year  is to develop a meaningful source of servicing income a s well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the direct consumer lending activity increased or million in s outstandings rose or million  in part reflective of a n aggressive promotion largely in the bank s southern region  versus a decrease o f or million in this line of business is comprised of conventiona l installment loans including some isolated installment lending to smal l businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principl e repayment begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity line s of credit 
the consumer direct segment as a percent of total loans was equal to the portfolio share

this level is approximately  or higher than one year earlier  primarily due to increases in residentia l mortgage and installment loan day delinquencies  partially offset by a n improvement in commercial and installment nonaccruals

the other loan wa s secured by fraudulent receivables discovered in the third quarter  and after a n initial write down at that time  the lack of successful litigation since the n has dictated that the entire million balance be written off 
thes e situations are considered by management to be unusual and isolated  and withou t them  commercial net charge offs would have been limited to  a  improvement from the limited asset based program through which this latte r loan was administered is being terminated

there are three primary sources of fundin g that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporation s ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital marke t borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million year ipc deposits public funds capital total funds sources borrowings amount total amount total amount total amount change the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ip c deposits  which reached an all time record for a fourth quarter average o f billion  an increase of million or from the comparable period 
this is the strongest dollar and percentage improvement in ipc deposit s in the last five years  excluding the impact of branch acquisitions  reflectiv e of excellent time deposit growth 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  d o not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and because the y represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variet y of loan  deposit and other financial service related products 
during th e period  overall consumer and business deposits have increased at a compound annual growth rate of per annum 
the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed modestly over the last five years a s measured by the trend of fourth quarter average balances 
the time deposit shar e has fluctuated within the narrow range of to 
compared to the prio r year  s mix increased by to as a result of a million or increase  reflective of the company s successful targeted cd programs 
sinc e their inception in the spring of  these promotions have attracted over million in new money  or of the promotions 
growth in time deposits als o reflects consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earnin g savings accounts  which have declined steadily during the five year period fro m of ipc deposits to the level in a portion of these saving s outflows may have been directed to higher yielding money market accounts  whic h have grown from of ipc deposits in to today 
lastly  while interes t checking accounts have remained virtually constant at over the last fiv e years  the mix of regular checking accounts demand deposits has increase d nicely from in to today 
excluding time accounts  ipc deposits wer e up by million or 
in  a million or increase in deman d deposits and a million or increase in money markets more than offse t reductions in other ipc categories 
deposits of local municipalities increased million or during the pas t year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter 
under new york state municipal law  th e company is required to collateralize all local government deposits wit h marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of thi s stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent t o capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at o r below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
consequently  levels o f municipal deposits fluctuate throughout the year depending on how competitiv e pricing compares to the aforementioned borrowing rates 
it should be noted tha t generally  utilization of municipal deposits has been flat to down over the las t five years as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a nationa l market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowin g sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  federa l reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreemen t market through established relationships with primary market security dealers also considered as borrowings are the million in company obligate d mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued to support s acquisitions and advances under a million line of credit tied to the da y libor rate with a large regional commercial bank 
capital market borrowing s averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter compared to million or of total funding sources for the same period i n as of december   or million of capital market borrowing s excluding the aforementioned line of credit and trust preferred securities ha d original terms of one year or less 
the balance of long term and short ter m borrowings represents a move during the last half of the year to convert highe r cost short term funding to cheaper long term funding  taking advantage of th e inverted treasury yield curve 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of th e following deposit categories is summarized below for the years indicated

this must b e accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand i s low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interes t rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of ne t interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidit y necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investmen t risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  an d e generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the othe r requirements 
since  the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology fo r managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  the compan y seeks to maximize shareholder value through both interest income and marke t value appreciation 
in the first quarter of  the bank s balance sheet simulation work pointe d towards an exposure to falling interest rates 
growth in floating rat e commercial loan assets as well as management s ability to hold rates low on cor e deposits in the face of rising interest rates contributed to this risk profile to balance this exposure  management continued on its course of extendin g the maturity and call protection of new investments made throughout the year despite long term interest rates falling by more than basis points over th e course of  the weighted average life of the portfolio stood at year s on december  versus years in the prior period 
the average portfolio yield  calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis an d excluding money market investments  rose to in from in th e prior year

market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from advers e changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchang e rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market ris k exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of thi s risk  over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon  i s an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors and reviewe d and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility fo r carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liabilit y management committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines an d strategies impacting the company s asset liability management activities base d upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and overall marke t interest rate related level and trends 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict futur e interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set o f measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interes t rate risk 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate ris k is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of difference s in maturity and repricing all balance sheet positions 
such work is furthe r augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturall y in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth an d funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategi c initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance shee t to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities  including an up or down basis point bp movement in rates from current levels 
while such an aggressiv e movement in rates provides management with good insight as to how the company s net interest income may perform under extreme market conditions  results from a more modest shift in interest rates are used as a basis to conduct day to da y business decisions 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivit y based on asset and liability levels on december   assuming no growth i n the balance sheet  and assuming a basis point instantaneous rate shock i n the prime rate  federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve 
regulatory model rate change dollar change perc ent of flat rate in basis points in s net interest income bp  bp a second simulation was performed based on what the company believes to b e conservative levels of balance sheet growth high single digit growth in loans low single digit growth in deposits  and necessary increases in borrowings  wit h no growth in investments or any other major portions of the balance sheet along with bp movements over a twelve month period in the prime rate federal funds rate  and a treasury yield curve moving closer to historica l spreads to fed funds 
under this set of assumptions  the bank s net interes t income is showing a mild level of sensitivity to rising interest rates 
in a falling interest rate environment  net interest income is slightly better tha n if rates were unchanged as a result of balance sheet strategies implemente d throughout management model rate change dollar change perc ent of flat rate in basis points in s net interest income bp  bp  the preceding interest rate risk analysis does not represent a company forecas t and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including th e nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions o n loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic an d local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to th e predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences o r competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis doe s not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipatin g changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  activ e management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to thes e circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are i n place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basi c surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short ter m liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection o f subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
the minimum polic y level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of tota l assets for both the and day time horizons
