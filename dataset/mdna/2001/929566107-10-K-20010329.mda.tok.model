rental  leasing and finance revenues in were equal to the net decrease in aftermarket parts and service revenues was driven primarily by lower sales from the company s parts distribution center  which during continued to focus on consolidating its operations with the distribution center acquired as part of the fruehauf asset acquisition in and the impact of the conversion and implementation of new operating software within the company s retail and distribution network 
gross profit years ended december  change gross profit by segment dollar amounts in millions manufacturing retail and distribution eliminations total gross profit the company finished with gross profit as a percent of sales of on a consolidated basis  the highest gross profit margin since this favorable increase in gross profits was primarily driven by the manufacturing segment  as discussed below 
the manufacturing segment s gross profit increased primarily as a result of a increase in net sales  higher margins from an improved product mix toward more proprietary products  reduced hardwood flooring costs resulting from the acquisition of the cloud companies in july and a general improvement in production efficiencies throughout the year 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit remained unchanged  primarily due to the increase in net sales previously discussed offset by lower margins resulting from a higher level of sales of used trailers which have lower gross profit percentages than the segment as a whole 
in addition  gross profits at the company s parts distribution center were down in compared to due to the margin impact of the company s consolidation of its two aftermarket parts operations and the conversion of its operating systems

selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of normal operating costs generated from the continued growth in this segment 
the retail and distribution segment s income from operations decreased by as a result of increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the growth of the segment 
other income expense interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

operating activities net cash used in operating activities of million in is primarily the result of the net loss and changes in working capital  partially offset by the add back of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and restructuring and other related charges 
changes in working capital consisted primarily of increased inventory and decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by a reduction in accounts receivable 
the net increase in inventory was primarily due to a higher level of used trailers taken in trade during the year  an increase in new trailer inventory within the retail branch network due to deteriorating conditions in the transportation industry  higher finished trailer inventory resulting from customers delaying taking delivery of the trailers they ordered offset partially by the manufacturing segment reducing its required raw materials inventory level 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of a favorable decrease in days sales outstanding offset somewhat by a decrease in the proceeds from the company s trade receivable securitization facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  compared to million as of december  advance rates under this facility continued to decline into and  as a result  the company will evaluate alternative financing arrangements or replacement facilities in to compensate for the lower borrowing capacity 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to the following capital expenditures of million during the year which were primarily associated with the following completion of a new  state of the art painting and coating system and plant expansion at its trailer manufacturing facility in huntsville  tennessee  additional composite material capacity  increasing productivity within the company s manufacturing operations in lafayette  indiana  and on going capital expenditures related to the company s branch expansion strategy 
net investment in the company s rental and operating lease portfolio of approximately million  net decrease in the company s finance contract portfolio of approximately million  and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of composite material production equipment closed in the fourth quarter of for approximately million 
the increase in the company s rental and operating lease portfolio primarily reflects the company s strategy to expand its used trailer rental program and is offset somewhat by million of proceeds from a new sale and leaseback facility related to the company s trailer rental facility which closed on december  the proceeds were used to reduce the company s line of credit borrowings 
this new facility  to be syndicated in the first quarter of and is expected to increase the total facility size to approximately million  allows for additional draws during as the trailer rental fleet continues to expand 
the facility has an initial term of months followed by four annual renewals and contains financial covenants substantially identical to the company s existing credit facilities 
the decrease in the company s finance contract portfolio was primarily driven by the september sale of approximately million of its leasing and finance portfolio previously discussed 
the company anticipates future capital expenditures related to the continuation of the capital projects previously discussed and other activities to be to million over the next months 
in addition  the company has future residual guarantees or purchase options of approximately million and million  respectively  related to certain new and used trailer transactions 
the majority of these do not come due until or after 
the company anticipates re marketing these trailers to the current users or through the retail and distribution segment 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities of million in is primarily due to an increase in total debt of million offset partially by the payment of common stock dividends and preferred stock dividends of million in the aggregate 
in connection with the aforementioned activity  the company s total debt increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the company maintains a million unsecured revolving line of credit facility  of which approximately million remains available at year end 
on september   the company entered into a million note purchase and private shelf agreement with a large financial institution 
under this agreement  the company initially issued million of unsecured senior notes  million of which are due september  with the remaining million due september  these series i senior notes bear interest at with interest payments due semi annually in march and september and contain financial covenants substantially identical to the company s existing senior notes 
the proceeds were used to repay the amount outstanding under the company s day credit facility 
the uncommitted private shelf agreement expires on september  and provides for the possible issuance of additional senior notes up to an aggregate amount of million 
on june   the company entered into a new  unsecured day credit facility  which permits the company to borrow up to million 
under this facility  the company has a right to borrow until june   at which time the principal amount then outstanding will be due and payable 
at december   the company had no borrowings against this facility 
other sources of funds for capital expenditures  continued expansion of businesses  dividends  principal repayments on debt  stock repurchase and working capital requirements are expected to be cash from operations  additional borrowings under the credit facilities and term borrowings and equity offerings 
the company believes these funding sources will be adequate for its anticipated requirements 
inflation the company has been generally able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s business 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which was subsequently amended by sfas and sfas these statements require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
this standard is effective for the company s financial statements beginning january   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of sfas did not have an effect on the company s annual results of operations or its financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company has exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and virgin plastic pellets 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company manages aluminum and virgin plastic pellets price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with its suppliers prior to a customer sales order being finalized 
because the company typically does not set prices for its products in advance of its commodity purchases  it can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting its prices for each order 
to the extent that the company is unable to offset the increased commodity costs in its product prices  the company s results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   the company had approximately million of london interbank rate libor based debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility  million of proceeds from its rental fleet sale and leaseback agreement which calls for libor based interest payments and million of proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization facility  which also requires libor based interest payments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates the company has historically entered into foreign currency forward contracts principally against the german deutschemark and french franc to hedge the net receivable payable position arising from trade sales including lease revenues and purchases with regard to the company s international activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
