overview the company is a corporation with a limited operating history  formed in february  when it commenced field trial and limited sales of its original product  the foxbox 
additionally  efforts were made to obtain operating capital and convert the company to a public entity 
this was successfully accomplished through a reverse merger with watchdog patrols  inc  a publicly traded otcbb  non reporting corporation 
operating expenses have increased significantly since the company s inception 
this reflects the cost associated with the formation of the company as well as increased efforts to promote market awareness for the company s security products and services  solicit new customers  recruit personnel  build operating infrastructure and continued product development 
netwolves products and services offer complete system solutions to organizations needing cost effective network security firewall  routing  intrusion detection  content filtering  email  intranet  ftp  etc 
complete with advanced integrated hardware  a user friendly interface  and net based expansion capabilities 
as companies combine data and communications to reduce costs  netwolves provides cost effective  value added expansion technologies such as vpn  a process used to allow secure data transmissions on a local area network  a wide area network  or to secure wireless network connections 
this feature affords the user virtually all the benefits of lease line service without the attendant recurring costs 
netwolves differentiates itself from its competitors primarily through its proprietary patent pending technology  which provides centralized remote monitoring and management srm tm 
while other  more labor intensive management systems currently exist  such systems require an inbound administrative port to provide remote monitoring and management 
most fortune companies are unwilling to take the risk of opening up an administrative inbound port while having their entire enterprise on a public broadband format 
hackers  using simple port scanning tools  can easily locate these administrative inbound ports 
srm tm has the ability to monitor thousands of locations concurrently without opening an administrative inbound port and allows the secure  remote management and monitoring of multiple all in one gateway servers located worldwide 
this monitoring can be performed in real time  and from one or numerous central sites 
this technology also allows a network administrator to create a configuration template with all the configuration information and changes required for all in one units 
this template can be applied to each unit  all via a secure configuration mechanism from the central monitoring location  without compromising network security 
it is this srm tm system that forms the basis of the company s agreement with the general electric company 
the company s initial target markets are perimeter offices of fortune companies and small to medium size business requiring secure managed internet access

the contract provides for the company to receive a fee upon shipment of each unit  and an additional one time configuration and installation fee

the increase in revenue in the technology segment is from shipments to its major customer within that segment
