there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funds on satisfactory terms or at all 
there are several factors that must be considered risks in that regard and those that are known to management are discussed in md a certain trends and uncertainties 
the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding the expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future

results of operations the following discussion of results of operations relates to the company s continuing business 
operating revenues totaled  in compared to zero in and  in related party contract revenues decreased from  in to zero in and the company has focused its resources on its development of its lead antisense oligonucleotide  genasense 
the completion of the sale of the assets of jbl resulted in a significant decrease in ongoing revenues  as all of the company s historical product sales have been attributable to jbl 
collaborative research and development revenues were  annually in and zero in and  recognized pursuant to the company s collaboration with johnson johnson consumer products  inc which has expired 
license and royalty revenues were  in these revenues were derived from the two non exclusive license agreements entered into in with sequitur incorporated and oasis biopharmaceuticals  inc  as discussed later 
costs and expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in these increases reflect additional clinical trial activity and related drug supply  salaries and non cash stock compensation charges 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
all preclinical biology and clinical trial work are now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for preclinical studies  clinical trials  the genasense antisense oligonucleotide program and increased regulatory costs 
the company will be required to assess the potential costs and benefits of developing its own antisense oligonucleotide manufacturing  marketing and sales activities if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing  as compared to establishing a corporate partner relationship 
research and development expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in such expenses do not include charges related to non cash equity related compensation 
the increase from through is due primarily to drug supply costs  investigator and monitor fees related to expanded clinical trials  along with increased patent amortization costs relating to the mbi and relgen acquisitions in it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future  as the development program for genasense expands and more patients are treated in clinical trials at higher doses  through longer or more treatment cycles  or both 
furthermore  the company is pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates  which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in such expenses do not include charges related to non cash equity related compensation 
the million decrease from to reflects reductions in accounting expenses and reduced patent abandonment costs 
the company recorded charges to general and administrative expenses of   and  in  and  respectively  to account for the carrying value of abandoned patents no longer related to the research and development efforts of the company 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to identify a material impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company continues to evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications  particularly as expenses to prosecute or maintain these patents come due 
through this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain these patents  seek to out license them  or abandon them 
the company recorded charges to non cash equity related compensation of million in  million in  and million in this increase is primarily due to the acceleration of outstanding stock options for the four members of the company s board of directors who resigned in march see note stockholders equity stock benefit plans for details 
the company s equity in net loss of its joint venture genta jago totaled million in  compared to a net gain of million in and in the increase in equity in net income of joint venture from to is due to an agreement signed on march   between the company and skyepharma on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement the interim jv agreement pursuant to which the company was released from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations of genta jago  the joint venture between the company and skyepharma 
skyepharma agreed to be responsible for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties and for the further development of the joint venture s products  with any net income resulting therefrom to be allocated in agreed upon percentages between the company and skyepharma 
as a result of the interim jv agreement  the company wrote off its liability relative to the company s recorded deficit in the joint venture and  as such  recorded a gain of approximately million for the three months ended march  also  according to revised revenue sharing agreements  the company reported approximately  for its proportionate share of net income of genta jago in relation to skyepharma s royalty agreement  with elan corporation  for genta jago s product  naproxen 

in accordance with revised revenue sharing agreements  genta reported  in income for the three months ended march  for its share of net income of genta jago in relation to skyepharma s royalty agreement  with elan corporation  for genta jago s product  naproxen 
interest income has fluctuated significantly each year and is anticipated to continue to fluctuate primarily due to changes in the levels of cash  investments and interest rates during each period 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of marketable securities of approximately million in in september  genta exercised  warrants to purchase shares of common stock of cv therapeutics  inc cv 
these warrants which were not traded and were restricted  were issued to genta by cv in connection with a licensing arrangement entered into in the company received approximately million in cash upon the sale of such common shares

the company also anticipates seeking additional product development opportunities from external sources 
such acquisitions may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
the company s working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of the company s research and development programs  ii the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that the company devotes to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products 
if the company successfully secures sufficient levels of collaborative revenues and other sources of financing  it expects to use such financing to continue to expand its ongoing research and development activities  preclinical testing and clinical trials  costs associated with the market introduction of potential products  and expansion of its administrative activities

see md a results of operations 
certain risks and uncertainties related to the company s business in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully 
the company may be unsuccessful in our efforts to commercialize our pharmaceutical products  such as ganite tm and genasense tm 
the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products involves a number of significant challenges 
in particular  our ability to commercialize products  such as ganite tm and genasense tm  depends  in large part  on the success of our clinical development programs  and our sales and marketing efforts to physicians  patients and third party payors 
a number of factors could impact these efforts  including our ability to demonstrate clinically that our products have utility beyond current indications  our limited financial resources and sales and marketing experience relative to our competitors  perceived differences between our products and those of our competitors  the availability and level of reimbursement of our products by third party payors  incidents of adverse reactions  side effects or misuse of our products and the unfavorable publicity that could result  or the occurrence of manufacturing  supply or distribution disruptions 
in particular  the company has said that it intends to be a direct marketer of its products in the united states 
our inability to build a sales force capable of marketing our pharmaceutical products will adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products 
ultimately  our efforts may not prove to be as effective as the efforts of our competitors 
in the united states and elsewhere  our products face significant competition in the marketplace 
the conditions that our products treat  and some of the other disorders for which we are conducting additional studies  are currently treated with several drugs  many of which have been available for a number of years or are available in inexpensive generic forms 
thus  we will need to demonstrate to physicians  patients and third party payors that the cost of our products is reasonable and appropriate in light of their safety and efficacy  the price of competing products and the related health care benefits to the patient 
even if we are able to increase sales over the next several years  we cannot be sure that such sales and other revenue will reach a level at which we will attain profitability 
our business will suffer if we fail to obtain timely funding 
our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our available resources  including the proceeds from our recent private offering  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs into the second quarter our future capital requirements will depend on the results of our research and development activities  preclinical studies and bioequivalence and clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  and regulatory processes of the fda and other regulatory authority 
if our operations do not become profitable before we exhaust existing resources  we will need to raise substantial additional financing in order to continue our operations 
we may seek additional financing through public and private resources  including debt or equity financing  or through collaborative or other arrangements with research institutions and corporate partners 
we may not be able to obtain adequate funds for our operations from these sources when needed or on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity  or securities convertible into equity  the ownership interest of existing genta stockholders will be subject to further dilution and share prices may decline 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  we will need to do the following delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves  sell genta to a third party  to cease operations  or declare bankruptcy 
many of our products are in an early stage of development 
most of our resources have been dedicated to applying molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to the research and development of potential antisense pharmaceutical products based upon oligonucleotide technology 
while we have demonstrated the activity of antisense oligonucleotide technology in model systems in vitro in animals  only one of these potential antisense oligonucleotide products  genasense  has begun to be tested in humans 
results obtained in preclinical studies or early clinical investigations are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained in extended human clinical trials 
our products may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics that may prevent our obtaining fda or foreign regulatory approval for any indication 
in addition  it is possible that research and discoveries by others will render our oligonucleotide technology obsolete or noncompetitive clinical trials are costly and time consuming and are subject to delays 
clinical trials are very costly and time consuming 
how quickly we are able to complete a clinical study depends upon several factors  including the size of the patient population  how easily patients can get to the site of the clinical study  and the criteria for determining which patients are eligible to join the study 
delays in patient enrollment could delay completion of a clinical study and increase its costs  and could also delay the commercial sale of the drug that is the subject of the clinical trial 
our commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials also may be delayed by many other factors  including the following inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials  inability to adequately monitor patient progress after treatment  unforeseen safety issues  the failure of the products to perform well during clinical trials  and government or regulatory delays 
we cannot market and sell our products in the united states or in other countries if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
the united states food and drug administration and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial premarket approval requirements on the introduction of pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed preclinical and clinical testing procedures and other costly and time consuming procedures 
satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years or more depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
while limited trials of our products have produced favorable results  we cannot apply for fda approval to market any of our products under development until the product successfully completes its preclinical and clinical trials 
several factors could prevent successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials  including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately that the product is safe and effective for use in humans 
if safety concerns develop  the fda could stop our trials before completion 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of our products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of our products could be limited 
we may be unable to obtain or enforce patents and other proprietary rights to protect our business 
our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to obtain us and foreign patent or other proprietary protection for our technologies  products and processes  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties 
legal standards relating to the validity of patents covering pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions and the scope of claims made under such patents are still developing 
there is no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
as a result  our ability to obtain and enforce patents that protect our drugs is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
we have more than us and international patents to aspects of oligonucleotide technology  which includes novel compositions of matter  methods of large scale synthesis and methods of controlling gene expression 
we may not receive any issued patents based on pending or future applications 
our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology 
additionally  our patents  our partners patents and patents for which we have license rights may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated or circumvented 
furthermore  rights granted under our patents may not cover commercially valuable drugs or processes and may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may have to initiate arbitration or litigation to enforce our patent and license rights 
if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology or to license the disputed rights from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
the cost to us of any litigation or proceeding relating to patent rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any pending patent or related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we rely on our collaborative arrangements with research institutions and corporate partners for development and commercialization of our products 
our business strategy depends in part on our continued ability to develop and maintain relationships with leading academic and research institutions and independent researchers 
the competition for such relationships is intense  and we can give no assurances that we will be able to develop and maintain such relationships on acceptable terms 
we have entered into a number of collaborative relationships relating to specific disease targets and other research activities in order to augment our internal research capabilities and to obtain access to specialized knowledge and expertise 
the loss of any of these collaborative relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
similarly  strategic alliances with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  may help us develop and commercialize drugs 
various problems can arise in strategic alliances 
a partner responsible for conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval may fail to develop a marketable drug 
a partner may decide to pursue an alternative strategy or alternative partners 
a partner that has been granted marketing rights for a certain drug within a geographic area may fail to market the drug successfully 
consequently  strategic alliances that we may enter into in the future may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
we may be unable to negotiate advantageous strategic alliances in the future 
the absence of  or failure of  strategic alliances could harm our efforts to develop and commercialize our drugs 
the raw materials for our products are produced by a limited number of suppliers 
the raw materials that we require to manufacture our drugs  particularly oligonucleotides  are available from only a few suppliers  namely those with access to our patented technology 
if these few suppliers cease to provide us with the necessary raw materials or fail to provide us with adequate supply of materials at an acceptable price and quality  we could be materially adversely affected 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of our products from third party payors 
our ability to commercialize drugs successfully will depend in part on the extent to which various third parties are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of our drugs and related treatments 
these third parties include government authorities  private health insurers  and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payors often challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
accordingly  if less costly drugs are available  third party payors may not authorize or may limit reimbursement for our drugs  even if they are safer or more effective than the alternatives 
in addition  the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the united states 
in particular  these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products 
in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we or our partners succeed in bringing therapeutic products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
we could become involved in time consuming and expensive patent litigation and adverse decisions in patent litigation could cause us to incur additional costs and experience delays in bringing new drugs to market 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have been characterized by time consuming and extremely expensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be required to commence  or may be made a party to  litigation relating to the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights  or the intellectual property rights of others 
such litigation could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions and products  or the enforceability  validity  or scope of protection offered by our patents 
such decisions could make us liable for substantial money damages  or could bar us from the manufacture  use  or sale of certain products  resulting in additional costs and delays in bringing drugs to market 
we may not have sufficient resources to bring any such proceedings to a successful conclusion 
it may be that entry into a licensing arrangement would allow us to avoid any such proceedings 
we may not be able  however  to enter into any such licensing arrangement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office and in international trade commission proceedings aimed at preventing the importing of drugs that would compete unfairly with our drugs 
such proceedings could cause us to incur considerable costs 
our business exposes us to potential product liability which may have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  exposes us to potential product and professional liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of human therapeutic products 
product liability claims can be expensive to defined and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance 
we maintain product liability insurance subject to various deductibles  but our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will always be able to purchase sufficient insurance at an affordable price 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
if we cease doing business and liquidate our assets  we are required to distribute proceeds to holders of our preferred stock before we distribute proceeds to holders of our common stock 
in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of genta  holders of genta common stock will not receive any proceeds until holders of  outstanding shares of genta series a preferred stock are paid a million dollar liquidation preference 
there currently exist certain interlocking relationships and potential conflicts of interest 
certain of our affiliates  aries domestic fund  lp  aries domestic fund ii  lp  and aries trust together the aries funds have the contractual right to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors 
paramount capital asset management  inc is the investment manager of the aries funds 
the aries funds have the right to convert and exercise their securities into a significant portion of the outstanding common stock 
dr 
lindsay a 
rosenwald  the chairman and sole stockholder of paramount capital asset management  is also the chairman of paramount capital  inc and of paramount capital investments  llc  a new york based merchant banking and venture capital firm specializing in biotechnology companies 
in the regular course of its business  paramount capital inc identifies  evaluates and pursues investment opportunities in biomedical and pharmaceutical products  technologies and companies 
generally  the law requires that any transactions between genta and any of our affiliates be on terms that  when taken as a whole  are substantially as favorable to us as those then reasonably obtainable from a person who is not an affiliate in an arms length transaction 
nevertheless  our affiliates  including paramount capital asset management and paramount capital inc  are not obligated pursuant to any agreement or understanding with the company to make any additional products or technologies available to the company  nor can there be any assurance  and we do not expect and you should not expect  that any biomedical or pharmaceutical product or technology developed by any affiliate in the future will be made available to us 
in addition  some of our officers and directors may from time to time serve as officers or directors of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
we cannot assure you that these other companies will not have interests in conflict with ours 
concentration of ownership of our stock could lead to a delay or prevent a change of control 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock 
they also own  through the exercise of options and warrants  the right to acquire even more common stock and preferred stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of genta 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that could discourage takeover attempts and impede stockholders ability to change management 
the approval of of our voting stock is required to approve certain transactions and to take certain stockholder actions  including the amendment of the by laws and the amendment  if any  of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation 
we anticipate that we will incur additional losses 
the company has not been profitable to date  incurring substantial operating losses associated with ongoing research and development activities  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing activities and development activities undertaken by genta jago 
from the period since its inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses until such time as product and other revenue exceed expenses of operating our business 
while we seek to attain profitability  we cannot be sure that we will ever achieve product and other revenue sufficient for us to attain this objective 
claims of genta s default under various agreements during  genta pharmaceuticals europe sa genta europe  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  received approximately million french francs or  as of december  approximately  of funding in the form of a loan from the french government agency l agence nationale de valorisation de la recherche anvar towards research and development activities pursuant to an agreement the anvar agreement between anvar  genta europe and genta 
in october  as part of the company s restructuring program  genta europe terminated all scientific personnel 
anvar asserted  in a letter dated february   that genta europe was not in compliance with the anvar agreement  and that anvar might request the immediate repayment of such loan 
on july   anvar notified genta europe by letter of its claim that the company remains liable for ff  as of december   approximately  and is required to pay this amount immediately 
the company does not believe that under the terms of the anvar agreement anvar is entitled to request early repayment 
anvar notified genta incorporated that it was responsible as a guarantor of the note for the repayment 
genta s agent in europe has again notified anvar that it does not agree that the note is payable 
the company is working with anvar to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution 
however  there can be no assurance that such a resolution will be obtained 
on june   marseille amenagement  a company affiliated with the city of marseilles  france  filed suit in france to evict genta europe from its facilities in marseilles and to demand payment of alleged back rent due and of a lease guarantee for nine years rent 
following the filing of this claim and in consideration of the request for repayment of the loan from anvar  genta europe s board of directors directed the management to declare a cessation of payment 
under this procedure  genta europe ceased any operations and terminated its only employee 
a liquidator was appointed by the court to take control of any assets of genta europe and to make payment to creditors 
in december  the court in marseilles dismissed the case against genta europe and indicated that it had no jurisdiction against genta incorporated 
in august  marseille amenagement instituted legal proceedings against the company at the commercial court in france  claiming alleged back rent payment of ff  as of december   approximately  and early termination payment of ff  as of december   approximately 
a court hearing has been scheduled for june  the company is working with its counsel in france to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution 
however  there can be no assurance that such a resolution will be obtained 
on december   the company has  of net liabilities of liquidated subsidiary recorded and  therefore  management believes no additional accrual is necessary 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs in relation to this claim 
dividends the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company is restricted from paying cash dividends on its common stock until such time as all cumulative dividends have been paid on outstanding shares of its series d preferred stocks 
the company currently intends to retain its earnings  if any  after payment of dividends on outstanding shares of series d preferred stocks  for the development of its business 
see md a liquidity and capital resources 
the company is dependent on key executives and scientists 
the company s success is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of key personnel and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional personnel or both is likely further to impede the achievement of development objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that genta will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
volatility of stock price  market overhang from outstanding convertible securities and warrants the market price of the company s common stock  like that of the common stock of many other biopharmaceutical companies  has been highly volatile and may be so in the future 
factors such as  among other things  the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials by the company or its competitors  other evidence of the safety or efficacy of products of the company or its competitors  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by the company or its competitors  governmental regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights of the company or its respective competitors  including litigation  fluctuations in the company s operating results  and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future price of the common stock 
as of march   the company had  shares of common stock outstanding 
future sales of shares of common stock by existing stockholders  holders of preferred stock who might convert such preferred stock into common stock  and option and warrant holders also could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
no predictions can be made of the effect that future market sales of the shares of common stock underlying the convertible securities and warrants referred to under the caption md a certain trends and uncertainties subordination of common stock to series a preferred stock  risk of dilution  anti dilution adjustments  or the availability of such securities for sale  will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such sales might occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices
