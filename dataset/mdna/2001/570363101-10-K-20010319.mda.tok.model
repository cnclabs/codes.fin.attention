overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using oil tankers  tank barges and tugboats to provide marine transportation services primarily along the gulf and atlantic coasts of the united states 
between and  the company has transported at least million barrels annually  a high of million barrels in  and a low of million barrels in the decrease in the barrels transported in resulted from the sale of vessels that occurred in and is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources 
many factors affect the number of barrels transported and will affect future results for maritrans 
such factors include the company s vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies operating and sourcing decisions  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
in  the company made several strategic moves in order to focus on those markets where it believes it possesses a long term competitive advantage and that should provide additional opportunities 
as a result  the company sold two small tug and barge units  which were working in puerto rico  two petroleum storage terminals in philadelphia  pa and salisbury  md  and twenty seven vessels working primarily in the northeastern united states 
before their sales  the sold vessels had transported approximately million barrels in and had represented approximately percent of revenues 
maritrans has successfully rebuilt two of its existing  single hulled  barges to a double hull design configuration  which complies with the provisions of the oil pollution act of opa 
the maritrans  a  barrel barge was completed in and the maritrans  a  barrel barge was completed in prefabrication has already commenced on a third single hull barge  the ocean cities that is scheduled to be in the shipyard in the spring and summer of the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to six more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hull barges and two tankers 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
legislation opa requires all newly constructed petroleum tank vessels engaged in marine transportation of oil and petroleum products in the us to be double hulled 
it also gradually phases out the operation of single hulled tank vessels in us waters  based on size and age  which includes most of maritrans existing barges 
three of the company s large oceangoing  single hulled barges will be affected on january  currently four of the company s barges and two tankers are equipped with double hulls meeting opa s requirements 
maritrans has initiated a program to rebuild its single hull tank barges to comply with opa 
this rebuilding relies upon a process of computer assisted design and prefabrication 
in january  the company was granted a patent for this process 
the first rebuilt barge  the maritrans  was completed and entered service in november the second rebuilt barge  the maritrans  was completed and entered service in december work has already commenced on a third single hull barge  the ocean cities 
the cost of rebuilding single hull barges is approximately per barrel compared to estimated costs of approximately per barrel for construction of a completely new double hull barge 
the total cost of rebuilding the company s entire single hull fleet is expected to exceed million 
the enactment of opa significantly increased the liability exposure of marine transporters of petroleum in the event of an oil spill 
in addition  several states in which maritrans operates have enacted legislation increasing the liability for oil spills in their waters 
the company currently maintains oil pollution liability insurance of up to one billion dollars per occurrence on each of its vessels 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover potential liabilities in the event of a catastrophic spill  that additional premium costs will be recoverable through increased vessel charter rates  or that such insurance will continue to be available in satisfactory amounts 
opa has increased the company s operating costs for the steps taken to minimize the risk of spills 
these costs include additional training  safety and contingency programs and have not yet been  and may never be  fully recovered through increased vessel charter rates 
in addition  management believes that the legislation has reduced the total volume of waterborne petroleum transportation because shippers of petroleum have tried to limit their exposure to opa liability 
opa has had a material adverse effect on maritrans operations  financial performance and expectations 
opa is expected to continue having negative effects on the entire us oil and marine petroleum transportation industry  including maritrans 
these negative effects could include  among others  i increased capital expenditures to cover the cost of mandated double hulled vessels  ii continued increased maintenance  training  insurance and other operating costs  iii increased liability and exposure to civil penalties and iv decreased operating revenues as a result of further reductions in volumes transported on vessels 
these effects could adversely affect maritrans financial condition  profitability and liquidity 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
although revenue in decreased million as a result of the sale of thirty one vessels and the petroleum storage terminals in  revenue for the remaining fleet for the comparable periods increased million 
this revenue increase resulted primarily from increases in the average daily rates charged to customers  which occurred later in and to increased fuel costs  discussed in operating expenses below  much of which the company was able to pass through to customers under its contractual agreements 
the increase in average daily rates over the comparable period in was due primarily to the amount of capacity already under contract to major oil companies and to low distillate inventories in the united states  particularly heating oil in the northeast 
both factors have raised rates for available jones act capacity 
the company expects the strong market rates to continue for several quarters and to have a positive impact on revenue 
vessel utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  decreased from percent in to percent in for the comparable fleet 
the overall decrease was the result of the maritrans being out of service for nine months in  for its double hull rebuild 
excluding the maritrans  utilization for the operating vessels was percent  which was moderately higher than s utilization of percent for the comparable fleet 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in to million in  due to the smaller fleet 
total costs and operating expenses for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was due primarily to the sale of assets discussed above 
in addition  shoreside related expenses decreased as a result of the reduction in shoreside staff in in september  the company recorded a severance charge of million for these employees  which was paid in maintenance expense decreased due to the reduction in fleet size and the impact of the rebuilding of the single hulled barges to double hulled barges  which allows certain maintenance procedures to be performed while the vessel is in the shipyard for its double hulling 
offsetting these decreases in operating expenses was an increase in fuel expense for fuel used on the vessels 
in  the average fuel rate increased compared to based on market expectations of oil prices continuing at or above per barrel  the company believes that its fuel costs will continue at rates higher than those in for the next several quarters 
some of this increase in fuel costs was passed through to customers under contractual agreements and will continue to be passed on in in  the company incurred million in relocation costs for the move of the corporate headquarters from philadelphia  pa to tampa  fl in the spring of operating income increased from million in to million in  as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million

other income for the year ended december  included a gain of million on the disposition of vessels and petroleum storage terminals 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of state taxes on certain asset sales in net income for the twelve months ended december   decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
net income for included million  net of tax  from the gain on the sale of assets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for of million were flat compared to million in barrels of cargo transported in decreased from million in to million in although barrels decreased  overall vessel utilization  including changes in the structure of the fleet  increased from percent in to percent in revenue increased as a result of the  barrel oil tanker which went into operation late in s results reflect the first complete year of operations for that tanker 
additionally  positively affecting revenues were a high level of contract business and a temporary increase in demand due to west coast refinery disruptions 
offsetting this increase was the sale of a significant number of vessels and terminals during the company sold five vessels in the first quarter of and sold the petroleum storage terminals in september  all of which were operating in in december  the company completed the sale of twenty six vessels most of which had worked in the northeast united states 
since this transaction occurred late in the year  revenue was affected only in december 
this transaction represented approximately twenty five percent of the company s cargo carrying capacity 
compared to  utilization improved as the maritrans returned to service after being rebuilt with a new internal double hull 
utilization of the remaining fleet  after vessel divestitures  was percent in compared to percent in total costs and operating expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
this increase was due to the addition to the fleet of the  barrel oil tanker late in  costs associated with turnover of qualified seagoing personnel and crew costs associated with vessels returning to service in  which had been in the shipyard during related periods in additionally  the company recorded a severance charge of million  in the third quarter of  for the impact of company s twenty five percent reduction of shoreside staff  which was announced in september these increases were offset by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the disposition of vessels and terminals discussed in revenue above 
operating income decreased from million in to million in  as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses

the tug and barge units were predominantly working in the northeastern united states and puerto rico 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of state taxes on certain asset sales in net income for the twelve months ended december   increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december   due primarily to the gain on the sale of assets
