all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations and are included in our results of operations from their respective effective dates 
as described above  on february  we acquired the assets of the tdts business of raytheon company and on april  we acquired the tcas product line from honeywell 
the rules of the sec require us to file separate audited financial statements and unaudited pro forma financial information for each of these two acquired businesses for periods prior to their acquisitions within days of the completion of each acquisition 
we were unable to complete these sec filings within their required filing dates because  prior to the acquisitions  each of the operations of tdts and tcas were not stand alone entities and their financial statements were not audited 
however  the audits of these financial statements were recently completed and we intend to file the required tdts and tcas financial statements and pro forma financial information with the sec in march we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and joint venture transactions  but we have not entered into any agreements with respect to any material transactions at this time 
results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations for the periods presented are impacted significantly by our acquisitions 
the tables below provide selected income statement data for l for the years ended december   and segment operating data year ended december  in millions sales secure communication systems specialized communication products  total    operating income secure communication systems specialized communication products operating income depreciation and amortization expenses included in operating income secure communication systems specialized communication products total ebitda secure communication systems specialized communication products total sales are after intersegment eliminations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ebitda is defined as operating income plus depreciation expense and amortization expense excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs 
ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
we present ebitda as additional information because we believe it to be a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
ebitda as we defined it may differ from similarly named measures used by other entities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased million to  million in sales grew million in the secure communication systems segment and million in the specialized communication systems 
operating income increased million to million in operating income as a percentage of sales operating margin improved to from 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million to million in  reflecting increased goodwill amortization associated with our acquisitions and additional depreciation related to our capital expenditures and acquired businesses 
our ebitda for increased million to million 
ebitda as a percentage of sales ebitda margin increased to in from in basic earnings per share eps grew to in and diluted eps grew to in basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  primarily because of common stock issued for exercises of employee stock options 
sales of our secure communication systems segment increased million to million in operating income increased million in operating margin improved to from 
we attribute the increase in sales principally to the acquisitions of link training and simulation and mpri and increased sales of secure telephone equipment ste  wideband secure data link programs  communication software support services and airport security equipment 
the increase in operating margin was principally attributable to improved margin on military communication systems and high data rate communications systems 
these margin improvements arose from cost reductions and improved operating efficiencies 
additionally  during a larger percentage of our sales were generated from fixed price contracts which generally have higher margins than sales generated from cost plus contracts 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in we expect operating margins for our secure communications systems segment in to remain relatively unchanged from those in and we do not expect a significant change in our mix of fixed price and cost plus contracts from that in sales within our specialized communication products segment increased million to  milliion in operating income increased million in operating margin improved to from 
we attribute this increase in sales principally to the acquisitions of tcas and space and navigation systems and volume increases on airborne dipping sonar systems  aviation recorders  and display products 
these increases in sales were partially offset by decreased shipments of naval power systems in compared with principally due to the slippage of certain sales into which were previously anticipated to occur in sales of our telemetry products were essentially unchanged in compared with due to continued softness in the space and broadband commercial communications markets 
we attribute our increase in operating margin principally to improved margins on avionics and ocean products 
these margin improvements arose from sales volume increases  costs reductions and the higher margins from the tcas business 
lower margins on our naval power systems due to less shipments and on our telemetry products and microwave components due to changes in product sales mix partially offset these operating margin improvements 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in interest expense increased million to million in principally because of the higher average outstanding debt during interest and other income decreased million to million 
interest and other income for includes gains of million from the sales of our interests in certain businesses 
these gains were largely offset by losses of million on the write down in the carrying value of certain investments and intangible assets 
the net gain contributed to our diluted eps 
excluding the net gain  diluted eps was  an increase of in compared with the income tax provision for reflects our effective income tax rate for of compared with the effective tax rate of for year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased million to  million in sales in the secure communication systems segment grew million and sales in the specialized communication products segment grew million in operating income increased million to million in operating margin improved to from 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million to million in  reflecting increased goodwill amortization associated with our acquisitions and additional depreciation related to our capital expenditures and acquired businesses 
our ebitda for increased million to million 
ebitda margin improved to in from in basic earnings per common share grew to in and diluted earnings per share grew to in basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased in and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  principally because of the timing of the issuance of million shares of common stock in connection with l holdings february stock offering 
sales within our secure communication systems segment increased million to million in operating income increased million to million in operating margin improved to from 
we attribute this increase in sales to greater sales on the u support program  ste and airport security systems and our acquisition of microdyne 
declines in sales on secure wideband data link programs  communication subsystems for the iss international space station and lmd kp local management device key processor units which occurred from the scheduled phasedown of these programs partially offset our sales gains 
we attribute the improvement in operating margin to military communication systems and high data rate communication systems 
these margin improvements arose from cost reductions and operating efficiencies and sales volume increases on ste  and were partially offset by lower margins from our microdyne acquired businesses and costs incurred for network security systems 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in sales within our specialized communication products segment increased million to million in operating income increased million to million in  and operating margin increased to from 
the increase in sales was principally attributable to the timing of our aydin and iec acquisitions in and the spd and ocean systems acquisitions in  as well as volume increases on ocean products  primarily for power distribution  control and conversion systems aviation recorders and space and satellite control products 
lower volume on microwave components and decreased shipments of displays and antenna products partially offset our sales gains 
we attribute the increase in operating margin to higher margins on ocean products and aviation recorders caused by volume increases and cost reductions  higher margins from the spd business and improved margins in for the sts business acquired in february lower operating margins from the aydin and iec businesses and lower margins due to declines in sales on microwave components and antenna products partially offset our operating margin improvements 
ebitda increased million to million in  and ebitda margin increased to from in interest expense increased million to million in because of the higher average outstanding debt during compared with principally because of the million of senior subordinated notes that we sold in december interest and other income for included million for a gain on the sale of a business 
the income tax provision for reflects our effective income tax rate for of  compared with the effective tax rate of for liquidity and capital resources balance sheet during  contracts in process increased million to million at december  the increase included million related to acquired businesses  and the remaining increase of million was principally from o increases in unbilled contract receivables principally arising from an increase in programs in production phases  during which unbilled costs and profits generally exceed progress payments and advances received from the customers until contract shipments are completed  and o increases in inventories for production on certain programs and products 
the increases in deferred tax assets  property  plant and equipment  intangibles  accrued employment costs  accrued expenses  other current liabilities and other liabilities during were principally related to acquired businesses 
the increase in accounts payable was principally related to balances of acquired businesses and the timing of payments to vendors 
the increase in other current liabilities was principally due to increases in estimated costs in excess of billings to complete contracts in process including the avcatt contract that were assumed as part of the tdts acquisition 
the increase in accrued interest was attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and the timing of interest payments 
statement of cash flows the following table provides cash flow statement data year ended december  in millions net cash from operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash from financing activities operating activities during  we generated million of cash from our operating activities  an increase of million from the million generated during earnings adjusted for non cash items and deferred taxes increased million to million in from million in during  our working capital and operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with an increase of million in our cash flows from operating activities during include uses of cash relating to performance on certain contracts in process including the avcatt contract that were assumed in the tdts acquisition for which the estimated costs exceed the estimated billings to complete these contracts 
we expect to continue to experience negative impacts on our cash flows as a result of the completion of these tdts acquired contracts in process during  but to a lesser extent than in additionally  we expect our working capital to increase during the first half of in connection with certain commercial programs and products 
during  we generated million in cash from operating activities  an increase of million over earnings adjusted for non cash items and deferred taxes increased million to million in from million in during our working capital and other operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with an increase of million in the increase was principally related to the greater working capital requirements primarily for contracts in process 
investing activities we continued to pursue our acquisition strategy during and invested million to acquire businesses  compared with million in we used million in to acquire businesses 
we make capital expenditures for improvement of manufacturing facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will be between million and million  compared with million for the year ended december  the anticipated increase is principally due to capital expenditures for our acquired businesses 
dispositions of property  plant and equipment for includes net proceeds of million related to a facility located in hauppauge  ny which we sold and leased back in december in  we sold our interests in two businesses for net cash proceeds of million  which are included in other investing activities 
financing activities at december   available revolver borrowings under our senior credit facilities were million after reductions for outstanding borrowings of million used principally to finance acquisitions and outstanding letters of credit of million 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
on april  we entered into a new day revolving senior credit facility for million that expires on april   which increased our senior credit facilities to million 
on april  we borrowed million under the facility to finance the tcas acquisition 
these borrowings were repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from our offering of the convertible senior subordinated notes which are described below 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
additionally  on april  we amended all of the senior credit facilities to change the spreads used to calculate the interest rates on borrowings and commitment fees on the unused commitments under the senior credit facilities 
the spreads are the same for all senior credit facilities  and the lenders all rank pari passu under our senior credit facilities 
in august  the other outstanding revolving day credit facility for million that was scheduled to expire was renewed for an additional days and will expire on august  at that time  we may extend the term  with the consent of our lenders  for a period of days and we also may exercise an option to convert of the borrowings outstanding into term loans which fully amortize over an eighteen month period beginning september  during the first half of we intend to restructure our million day revolving credit facility that expires april  together with all of our senior credit facilities to extend their maturities 
in the fourth quarter of l holdings sold million of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes in a private placement 
the net proceeds from this offering amounted to million after debt issuance costs  and were used to repay revolver borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
the convertible notes may be converted at any time into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible notes are jointly and severally guaranteed the guarantees by certain existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of l holdings  including l communications the guarantors 
the guarantees are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of the guarantors and rank pari passu with the other senior subordinated indebtedness of the guarantors  which are described below 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement that we entered into with the initial purchaser of the convertible notes  we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec by april   which is days after the original issuance of the notes to cover resales by holders of the convertible notes and guarantees  and the l holdings common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
if we do not file the registration statement with the sec on or before april   liquidated damages  in the form of additional interest  will accrue on the convertible notes from april  to but excluding the day on which the registration statement is filed 
in no event will liquidated damages exceed per annum of the principal amount outstanding under the notes 
we expect to file the registration statement with the sec by the end of march on february   we sold million shares of l holdings common stock in a public offering for per share which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  as part of the same transaction million shares of l holdings common stock were sold by lehman brothers capital partners iii  lp and its affiliates the lehman partnership and lockheed martin in a secondary public offering 
in october  lockheed martin sold its remaining l holdings common stock 
in december  the lehman partnership distributed approximately million shares of its shares of common stock of l holdings to its partners 
on december  the lehman partnership owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of l holdings 
in april  may and december  l communications sold million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  and million of senior subordinated notes due collectively  the senior subordinated notes  whose aggregate net proceeds amounted to million after debt issuance costs 
the senior credit facilities  senior subordinated notes and convertible notes contain financial covenants which remain in effect so long as we owe any amount or any commitment to lend exists thereunder 
as of december   l communications had been in compliance with the covenants of the agreements governing those loans at all times 
the borrowings under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by l holdings and by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of l communications 
the payments of principal and premium  if any  and interest on the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by l holdings and substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  including l communications 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our debt and related financial covenants at december  based upon our current level of operations  we believe that our cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  program and other discretionary investments  and interest payments for the foreseeable future  including at least the next three years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels  or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  to make necessary capital expenditures and to make discretionary investments 
market risks all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities  purchased interest rate cap contracts and written interest rate floor contracts  all of which are denominated in us dollars 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facilities at december  was 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes and convertible notes are fixed rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates 
to mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on borrowings under the senior credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates we entered into interest rate cap and floor contracts 
the interest rate cap contract provides protection against increases in interest rates on borrowings to the extent o those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the cap contract  and o the interest rate paid on the borrowings rises above the sum of the cap reference rate plus our applicable borrowing spread 
however  the written interest rate floor limits our ability to enjoy decreases in interest rates on our borrowings to the extent o those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the floor contract  and o the interest rate paid on those borrowings falls below the sum of the floor reference rate plus our applicable borrowing spread 
we attempt to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into interest rate agreements only with major financial institutions that are expected to perform fully under the terms of such agreements 
cash payments between us and the counterparties are made at the end of each quarter 
such payments are recorded as adjustments to interest expense and were not material to interest expense or cash flows for  or additional data on our debt obligations  our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we pay on borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate agreements are provided in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
for the interest rate agreements  the table below presents significant contract terms and fair values on december  caps floors in millions notional amount cap floor interest rate reference rate month libor month libor designated maturity quarterly quarterly expiration date march  march  fair value foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct some of our operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  some of our us operations have contracts with foreign customers denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the risk associated with certain of these contracts denominated in foreign currency we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and the fair value of these contracts was million 
we account for these contracts as hedges 
equity price risk 
our investments in common equities are subject to equity price risk 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such instruments amounted to million at the end of there were no significant changes in our market risks during backlog and orders we define funded backlog as the value of contract awards received from the us government  which the us government has appropriated funds  plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the us government which have yet to be recognized as sales 
our funded backlog as of december  was  million and as of december  was  million 
we expect to record as sales approximately of our december  funded backlog during however  there can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become sales in any particular period  if at all 
our funded orders were  for   million for and  million for our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contract awards including those pertaining to multi year  cost plus reimbursable contracts  which are generally funded on an annual basis 
funded backlog also excludes the sales value of unexercised contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the sales value of purchase orders that may be issued under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements 
research and development company sponsored research and development costs including bid and proposal costs were million for  million for  and million for customer funded research and development were million for  million for  and million for contingencies we are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and to a lesser degree  under foreign government contracts  some of which are funded by the us government 
all such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements  and  periodically  agencies of the us government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
under government procurement regulations  an indictment by a federal grand jury could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term 
additionally  in the event that us government expenditures for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide are reduced  and not offset by greater commercial sales or other new programs or products  or acquisitions  there may be a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us 
we continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws 
while it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws  based upon available internal and external assessments  with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware  we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries  if any  there are no environmental loss contingencies that  individually or in the aggregate  would be material to our consolidated results of operations 
also  we have been periodically subject to litigation  claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business 
we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to those investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments of which we are aware  we are of the opinion that the probability is remote that  after taking into account certain provisions that have been made with respect to these matters  the ultimate resolution of any such investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   we filed a complaint against raytheon and raytheon technical services company in the court of chancery for the state of delaware in and for new castle county  alleging that raytheon failed to disclose material liabilities in connection with the sale of tdts to us in february specifically  the complaint alleges that raytheon misrepresented the financial liabilities associated with the avcatt contract which will cause us to incur damages of approximately million 
we assumed the avcatt contract as part of our acquisition of tdts from raytheon which was completed in february the complaint seeks rescission of the tdts asset purchase and sale agreement and alternatively  rescission of the avcatt contract  rescissory damages and breach of contract 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value and is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  which replaces sfas sfas revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas s provisions without reconsideration 
sfas is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
fin clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is primarily effective july   with some provisions effective earlier 
we have adopted the accounting and disclosures required by fin for all periods presented 
inflation the effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of our sales are made under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some contracts provide for price adjustments through escalation clauses 
forward looking statements certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations  cash flows  financial position  economic performance  and financial condition  including in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  including projections of orders  sales  operating margins  earnings  cash flow  research and development costs  working capital  capital expenditures and other projections  they are subject to several risks and uncertainties  and therefore  we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved 
such statements will also be influenced by factors such as o our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry including changing priorities or reductions in the us government defense budget  o our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of  or contractors to  the us government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform  o the ability to obtain or the timing of obtaining future government contracts  o the availability of government funding and customer requirements  o economic conditions  competitive environment  international business and political conditions  timing of international awards and contracts  o our extensive use of fixed price contracts as compared to cost plus contracts  o our ability to identify future acquisition candidates or to integrate acquired operations  o the rapid change of technology in the communication equipment industry  o the high level of competition in the communications equipment industry  o our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in commercial products or companies  o the significant amount of our debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements  o collective bargaining agreements and labor disputes  and o pension  environmental or legal matters or proceedings and various other market  competition and industry factors  many of which are beyond our control 
readers of this document are cautioned that our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
as for the forward looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections  actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected 
given these uncertainties  you should not place any reliance on these forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made
