see business general 
revenue growth the company s strategy is to increase shareholder value by growing its existing businesses and expanding into other segments by applying its expertise in acquiring  financing  integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses 
the company has increased its revenues and market share in the metal food container  plastic container and closure and specialty packaging markets through acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result of this strategy  the company has diversified its customer base  geographic presence and product line 
for example  during the past thirteen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations 
the company s acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  agrilink and campbell reflect this trend 
during this period  the company s overall share of the us metal food container market more than quadrupled  from approximately in to approximately in see business general growth strategy 
the company s plastic container and plastic closure business has also improved its market position since  with sales increasing by more than fourfold to million in this improvement was achieved through strategic acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
the plastic container and plastic closure segments of the consumer goods packaging industry are highly fragmented  and management intends to pursue consolidation opportunities at reasonable cash flow multiples in those segments 
see business general growth strategy 
management believes that it can successfully apply its acquisition and operating expertise to new segments of the consumer goods packaging industry 
with its acquisition of rxi in october  the company expanded its business into plastic closures  caps  sifters and fitments and thermoformed plastic tubs 
although no assurance can be given that the company will be able to locate or acquire attractive acquisition candidates on acceptable terms  management believes that certain trends in and characteristics of the consumer goods packaging industry will generate attractive acquisition opportunities in complementary business lines 
importantly  the industry is fragmented  with numerous segments and multiple participants in the various segments 
additionally  many of these segments are experiencing consolidation 
see business general growth strategy 
operating strategy the company seeks to acquire businesses at reasonable cash flow multiples and to enhance profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
the additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled the company to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings 
in addition  the company s acquisitions have enabled it to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
the company has also benefited from the economies of its scale and from the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions  as well as from the investment of capital to upgrade the acquired facilities 
see business general growth strategy enhance profitability of acquired companies 
historically  the company has been able to improve the operating margins of its acquired businesses through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
following an acquisition  the company initiates a systematic program  which usually is implemented over a number of years  to optimize its manufacturing facilities 
as a result  this improvement to operating margins generally has been realized over a number of years 
in addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses  the company has improved the operating performance of its existing plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
the company has also invested capital for new market opportunities  such as easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  the company has invested million in capital to improve its productivity  reduce its manufacturing costs and invest in new market opportunities 
for the period from through  the operating margins of the company s metal food container business without giving effect to rationalization charges in improved from approximately in to in this improvement was principally a result of the benefits realized from rationalization and integration activities  manufacturing efficiencies  economies of increased purchasing volumes and the elimination of redundant costs related to its acquisitions since  the investment of capital for productivity improvements and new market opportunities and an improved sales mix 
this improvement was achieved despite the impact of lower margin sales to campbell  price reductions under extended long term supply agreements and competitive pricing pressure 
the operating margins of the company s plastic container business also improved from approximately in to in this improvement was primarily due to benefits realized as a result of higher unit sales principally from acquisitions  an improved sales mix  manufacturing efficiencies  economies of its scale  elimination of redundant costs related to acquisitions and the investment of capital for productivity improvements 
the company operates in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
further  the multi year supply arrangements entered into by the company s metal food container business with many of its customers  including nestle  del monte  campbell and several other major food producers  limit the company s ability to increase its margins 
the company estimates that approximately of its projected metal food container sales in will be pursuant to such arrangements 
see business sales and marketing 
these multi year supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of material and labor cost changes  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of the company s results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
see business raw materials 
historically  the company has been successful in continuing its multi year supply arrangements with its customers  without any resulting material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future the company will retain these multi year supply arrangements or  if the company continues these arrangements  that they will be continued without any material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
recently  the company and nestle agreed to extend the term of the nestle supply agreements for approximately half of the metal containers sales thereunder by seven years from through  in return for certain price reductions which took effect in the company believes that these price reductions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
see business sales and marketing 
the company s metal food container business sales and  to a lesser extent  operating income are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable  tomato and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  the company has historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of its annual income from operations during these quarters 
this seasonal impact has been mitigated somewhat by the acquisition of cs can 
sales to campbell generally have been highest in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal demand for soup products 
financial strategy the company s financial strategy is to use leverage to support its growth and increase shareholder returns 
the company s stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of its long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports its financial strategy 
management has successfully operated its businesses and achieved its growth strategy while managing the company s indebtedness 
management intends to continue to apply this financial strategy in its business as it pursues its growth strategy 
in  the company used million of its revolving loan facility under its us senior secured credit facility to finance its acquisition of rxi 
in  the company used million of its revolving loan facily under its us senior secured credit facility to finance its acquisitions of winn  cs can and clearplass 
as part of its financial strategy and in the absence of compelling acquisition opportunities  the company intends to use its free cash flow to repay indebtedness or for other permitted purposes 
in  for example  the company did not complete any acquisition  and it reduced its total debt by million as compared to despite higher capital expenditures and interest expense and the incurrence of million of indebtedness for common stock repurchases in to the extent the company utilizes its revolving loan borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  its interest expense may increase 
further  since the company s revolving loan and term loan borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates  it is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  its interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap arrangements that the company entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  the company had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
see effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
in light of the company s strategy to use leverage to support its growth and optimize shareholder returns  the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense

management believes that cash generated by operations and funds from the revolving loans available under the company s senior secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations until the final maturity of its revolving loan facilities under its senior secured credit facilities on december  management also believes that it will be able to refinance its senior secured credit facilities and replace its revolving loan facilities prior to december  on terms which will be acceptable to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect such refinancing or  if it is able to effect such refinancing  that such refinancing will be effected on the same terms including interest rates as the company s current senior secured credit facilities 
the ability of the company to effect any such refinancing and the terms thereof including interest rates will depend upon a variety of factors  including the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors including the state of the economy and the financial markets and other factors beyond the control of the company and its subsidiaries affecting the business and operations of the company and its subsidiaries as well as prevailing interest rates  the timing of such refinancing and the amount of debt to be refinanced 
the company is also continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and will likely incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the revolving loan facility of its us senior secured credit facility  to finance any such acquisition 
the company s senior secured credit facilities and the indenture with respect to the debentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the company s ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
management does not expect these limitations to have a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in such financing agreements and believes that it will continue to be in compliance during with all such covenants 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on the company  other than to increase its cost of borrowing 
in general  the company has been able to increase the sales prices of its products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
see business raw materials and sales and marketing 
because the company has indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  the company s financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   the company had  million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  taking into account interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company as of such date to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate was exchanged for fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the aggregate notional principal amounts of these agreements totals million  with million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in and million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in in march  the company entered into additional interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional principal amount of million which exchanged floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate for fixed rates of interest of and 
these agreements mature in depending upon market conditions  the company may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in the company s judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge its exposure against interest rate volatility

new accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply agreements 
eitf issue no 
establishes accounting standards for costs incurred after december  to design and develop molds  dies and other tools that an entity will not own and that will be used to produce products that will be sold under a long term arrangement 
it had been the company s policy to expense such costs as incurred  however  as required by eitf issue no 
 the company began to capitalize such costs in adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
eitf issue no 
addresses the income statement classification for shipping and handling fees and costs 
the company s statements of income  including those presented for comparative purposes  include the reclassification of certain revenue reductions to cost of goods sold

in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amended sfas no 
to delay its effective date 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which further amended sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
initial adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  on january  did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  since the impact of sfas no 
 as amended  thereafter is dependent on future market rates and outstanding derivative positions  the company cannot determine at this time the impact that its application subsequent to january  will have on its financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  the company also has limited foreign currency risk associated with its canadian operations and risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to such risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet the company s objectives 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing cost 
to achieve its objectives  the company regularly evaluates the amount of its variable rate debt as a percentage of its aggregate debt 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in its variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k outline the principal amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
see also management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations 
based on the average outstanding amount of variable rate indebtedness of the company in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for the company s variable rate indebtedness would have impacted the company s interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of the company s interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk the company does not conduct a significant portion of its manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  the company s only foreign activities are conducted in canada 
the company s reported financial results could be affected  however  by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets where it operates 
when the us dollar strengthens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against such foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency operating profits generally increases 
since the company does not have significant foreign operations  the company does not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
because the company s canadian subsidiary operates within its local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance such operation with local currency borrowings 
in determining the amount of such borrowings  the company evaluates the operation s short and long term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event that the canadian currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
furthermore  the company s canadian operating profit is used to repay its local borrowings or is reinvested in canada  and is not expected to be remitted to the company or invested elsewhere 
as a result  it is not necessary for the company to mitigate the economic effects of currency rate fluctuations on its canadian earnings 
commodity pricing risk the company purchases commodities for its products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  the company does not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to its ability to pass on price changes to its customers 
the company also purchases other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and is subject to risks on the pricing of such commodities 
in general  the company purchases such commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
the company manages part of its exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k outlines the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions
