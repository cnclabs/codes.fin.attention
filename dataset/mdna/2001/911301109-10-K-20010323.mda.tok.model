general the company upfc is a specialty finance company engaged primarily in originating and acquiring for investment retail automobile installment sales contracts and automobile insurance premium finance contracts 
we market to customers who generally cannot obtain financing from traditional lenders 
these customers usually pay higher loan origination fees and interest rates than those charged by traditional lenders to gain access to consumer financing 
we fund our operations principally through retail and wholesale deposits  fhlb advances and whole loan sales 
upfc commenced operations in by purchasing from the rtc certain assets and assuming certain liabilities of the bank s predecessor  pan american federal savings bank 
in  we commenced our insurance premium finance business through a joint venture with bpn and in  we commenced our automobile finance business 
in february  we closed our subprime mortgage finance business to focus on our auto lending and insurance premium finance businesses 
the subprime mortgage business originated and sold or securitized subprime mortgage loans secured primarily by first mortgages on single family residences 
in connection with the discontinuance of the mortgage finance division  all related operating activity for all periods presented is treated as discontinued operations for financial statement reporting purposes 
for the purpose of determining net interest income related to discontinued operations  we included all interest income from our mortgage finance business less an allocation for interest expense 
we allocated deposits and warehouse lines of credit to the discontinued mortgage operations in computing interest expense 
all non interest income and non interest expense of the mortgage operations was also charged to discontinued operations 
for more information  see item business discontinued operations mortgage finance 
during  upfc through its wholly owned subsidiary  worldcash  continued its development of a cross border money transfer business to be initially dedicated to the hispanic community 
all development costs related to this venture  approximating  in  have been expensed in upfc s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition to its business development costs and as part of the software technology for this business  worldcash made a million investment in airtime technologies  inc airtime representing a ownership interest 
in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote down this investment to  reflecting management s estimate of the current fair value of this investment  and airtime s most recent operating and revenue projections 
in february  worldcash terminated its activities associated with developing a money transfer business  however  it still maintains its investment in airtime 
finance companies  such as upfc  generate income from a combination of spread or net interest income ie  the difference between the yield on loans  net of loan losses  and the cost of funding and non interest income ie  the fees received for various services and gains on the sales of loans 
income is used to cover operating expenses incurred ie  compensation and benefits  occupancy and other expenses in generating that income 
each of our businesses  as described below  generates income from a combination of spread and non interest income 
automobile finance in  the bank commenced its automobile finance business through its subsidiary  united auto credit corporation such business  uacc 
uacc acquires  holds for investment and services nonprime retail automobile installment sales contracts auto contracts generated by franchised and independent dealers of used automobiles 
as uacc provides all marketing  origination  underwriting and servicing activities for its loans  income is generated from a combination of spread and non interest income and is used to cover all operating costs  including compensation  occupancy and systems expense 
insurance premium finance in may  the bank entered into a joint venture with bpn relating to an insurance premium finance business under the name classicplan such business is referred to herein as ipf 
under this joint venture  which commenced operations in september  the bank underwrites and finances automobile and commercial insurance premiums in california and bpn markets the financing program and services the loans for the bank 
the bank lends to individuals for the purchase of single premium insurance policies and the bank s collateral is the unearned insurance premium held by the insurance company 
the unearned portion of the insurance premium is refundable to ipf in the event the underlying insurance policy is canceled 
upfc does not sell or have the risk of underwriting the underlying insurance policy 
as a result of bpn performing substantially all marketing and servicing activities  our role is primarily that of an underwriter and funder of loans 
therefore  ipf s income is generated primarily on a spread basis  supplemented by non interest income generated from late payment and returned check fees 
the bank uses this income to cover the costs of underwriting and loan administration  including compensation  occupancy and data processing expenses 
the bank upfc funds its operations primarily through the bank s deposits  fhlb advances and loan sales 
as of december   the bank was a five branch federal savings bank with million in deposits 
the loans generated by our insurance premium and automobile finance businesses currently are funded and held by the bank 
in addition  the bank holds a portfolio of primarily traditional residential mortgage loans acquired from the rtc in and  which loans aggregated million in principal amount before unearned discounts and premiums at december  the bank generates spread income not only from loans originated or purchased by each of our principal businesses  but also from loans purchased from the rtc  its securities portfolio  and consumer loans originated by its retail deposit branches 
this income is supplemented by non interest income from its branch banking activities eg  deposit service charges  safe deposit box fees  and is used to cover operating costs and other expenses 
average balance sheets the following tables set forth information relating to our continuing operations for the years ended december   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities allocated to continuing operations  respectively  for the periods shown

comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general upfc incurred a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share for the same period a year ago 
including discontinued operations  we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share in  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share in contributing to our loss from continuing operations were charges as described below 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million during to reflect a write down in the value of residual interests arising from our subprime mortgage securitizations 
we have subsequently sold these residual interests to a third party in january and this sale was used to determine the fair value of these assets at december  a pre tax charge of million was also recorded during  relating to a write down of our goodwill arising from the purchase of norwest financial coast s insurance premium finance operations 
the write down reflects impairment in the value of this goodwill as a result of a decline in future benefits expected to be received from this acquisition as a result of a change in market conditions 
interest income for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period a year ago 
gross automobile receivables increased from million at december  to million at december  accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
interest income interest income increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile installment contracts  which increased million  and securities  which increased million 
the increase in auto contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional dealer contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in securities was primarily a result of the reinvestment of proceeds received from the sale of discontinued mortgage assets 
the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to the increase in securities  which have lower yields compared to loans 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets at december  compared with of our average interest earning assets at december  interest expense interest expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  and a increase in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest component of the increase in interest bearing liabilities was deposits of the bank  which increased from an average balance of million in to million in the increase in average deposits was due primarily to the reallocation of deposits to continuing operations compared to a year ago 
sales of subprime mortgage loans discontinued operations in reduced the average deposits allocated to discontinued operations 
the average cost of deposits increased from for to for  generally as a result of an increase in market interest rates and the repricing of deposits to these higher market rates 
provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses associated with our insurance premium finance business 
our total allowance for losses was million at december  compared with million at december   representing of loans held for investment at december  and at december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with in the increase is due to higher charge offs from subprime mortgage loans in connection with the wind down of our discontinued mortgage operations 
in addition to provision for losses  our allowance for loan losses is also increased by an allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
we allocate the estimated amount of acquisition discounts attributable to credit risk to the allowance for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of loans held for investment and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we report loans held for sale at the lower of cost or market value  accordingly  loan loss provisions are not established for this portfolio 
while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income non interest income decreased million  from  in to a loss of million in the decrease resulted from an million pre tax write down of the value of residual interests in securitizations 
we sold our residual interests in securitizations in january and this sale was used to determine the fair value of these assets at december  other components of non interest income include fees and charges for bank services and miscellaneous other items 
the total of all of these items decreased  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  included in non interest income during is a charge of  in connection with the write down of upfc s investment in airtime 
non interest expense non interest expense increased million  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase primarily reflects an increase in salaries  employee benefits and other personnel costs of approximately million associated with the expansion of our automobile finance operations 
in addition  occupancy expense increased  reflecting the costs associated with maintaining and expanding the branch offices in the auto finance lending area 
also  as a result of growth in our automobile lending operations  other operating expense  including professional fees  supplies  data processing  loan servicing expense  telephone and postage  increased million during compared to the same period in also included in other expense is a pre tax charge of million in connection with the write down of goodwill arising from the purchase of norwest financial coast s insurance premium finance operations and a  pre tax provision for the relocation of certain offices 
the goodwill write down reflects impairment as a result of a decline in expected future benefits due to a change in market conditions 
most of this decline is a result of lower insurance premiums in california and significant competition from direct bill payment programs utilized by insurance companies  which has reduced the amount of premiums available for financing 
the provision for office relocation expenses consisting primarily of severance costs is attributable to the move of our corporate and executive offices from san mateo  california to orange county  california 
income taxes benefit income taxes benefit decreased million  from million for the twelve months ended december  to a benefit of million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease occurred as a result of a million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes between the two periods  and a decrease in the effective tax benefit rate from for to for the decline in the effective tax benefit rate reflects an increase in income or loss apportioned to states with lower tax rates 
discontinued operations mortgage finance as announced on february   we discontinued our subprime mortgage origination operations 
all related operating activity of the mortgage operations has been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the wind down of these operations  sales or securitizations of subprime mortgage loans in were million  compared with billion in prior to closing these operations  we originated million in subprime mortgage loans during compared with million during the year ended december  a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  of  was recorded in reflecting the operating activity of these operations during this period 
during the second quarter of  a charge of million  net of tax  was recorded related to loss on disposal of our subprime mortgage finance business 
this was in addition to a charge of million  net of tax  included in our results of operations 
included in our statement of financial condition as of december   is a reserve of million consisting primarily of lease and other contractual obligations related to the estimated remaining costs of discontinuing the subprime mortgage operations 
if actual costs of disposal are higher than anticipated  additional charges may be required in subsequent periods results of operations 
all activities related to discontinued operations in were charged to the discontinued operations reserve 
in determining net interest income charged to discontinued operations  we included all interest income from our mortgage finance business less an allocation for interest expense 
we allocated average deposits of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   and average warehouse lines of credit of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   to discontinued operations in computing interest expense 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  from million at december  to million at december  the increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in securities available for sale  from million at december  to million at december   partially offset by a million decrease in loans held for sale  from million at december  to  at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million  from million at december  to million at december  at december   we significantly increased our liquidity position in accordance with year contingency plans 
subsequent to the year conversion  the excess liquidity was used to paydown our mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
securities available for sale increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase reflects the reinvestment of proceeds received from sales of loans of the discontinued mortgage business 
residual interests in securitizations consist of beneficial interests in the form of an interest only strip representing the subordinated right to receive cash flows from a pool of securitized loans after payment of required amounts to the holders of the securities and certain costs associated with the securitization 
our residual interests were million at december  compared to million at december  upfc sold all of the residual interests arising from the securitizations in january accordingly  as of december   these residual interests were valued based on the terms and conditions of the sales contract and the net cash proceeds received at the settlement date in january valuations of the residual interests at december  were based on discounted cash flow analyses using prepayment and default assumptions that market participants would use for similar instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interests rate risks 
premises and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily as a result of the continuing growth of our auto finance business 
deposit accounts increased million  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in wholesale deposits  which grew from million at december  to million at december  as a result of the purchase of brokered cd s of million in retail deposits increased million  from million at december  to million at december  other interest bearing liabilities include federal home loan bank advances and warehouse lines of credit 
fhlb advances were million at december  and there were no advances outstanding at december  the increase in fhlb advances was primarily due to our use of wholesale borrowings as an alternative to deposits as a funding source for asset growth 
warehouse lines of credit were million at december  there were no outstanding balances at december  as proceeds from sales of subprime mortgage loans were used to pay down outstanding balances 
net deferred tax assets were million at december  due principally to temporary differences in the recognition of gain on sale of loans and discontinued operations for federal and state income tax reporting and financial statement reporting purposes 
for income tax purposes  loans held for sale are marked to market as compared to financial statement reporting where loans are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  net deferred tax assets in included approximately million relating to the discontinuance of our mortgage operations 
shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december   as a result of our net loss of million  which was partially offset by  of unrealized gain on securities 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general upfc incurred a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to net income of million for the same period in included in these results is a loss from discontinued operations of million in and income from discontinued operations of million in upfc s loss from discontinued operations of million in and income from discontinued operations in of million resulted from the closure of our subprime mortgage finance business 
included in the loss from discontinued operations is a million charge  net of tax  for the estimated loss on disposal of this business 
the estimated loss on disposal includes lease termination costs  employment severance and benefits  write off of fixed assets and leasehold improvements and an accrual for estimated future operating losses  net of estimated gains on loan sales related to the subprime mortgage operations 
the discontinued mortgage business operating loss was  in compared with income of million in the loss reflects significantly lower gains on sales of loans compared with the prior year 
the results also reflect lower operating expenses  however  the decline in loan sale gains was much larger than the decline in operating expenses resulting in a significant decline in operating income 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share for  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share for the same period in the results include non recurring gains of  from the sale of loans that were purchased from the resolution trust corporation in and growth in our auto finance business resulted in an increase in auto contracts purchased from million for to million for  while insurance premium finance originations decreased from million to million  respectively 
mortgage loan originations were million for and billion for the comparable period in while sales or securitizations of mortgage loans were billion for the twelve months ended december  and billion for the comparable period in interest income interest income increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  due primarily to a increase in the average yield on earning assets 
average earning assets in total were substantially unchanged from to the largest changes in the components of average earning assets were auto contracts and mortgage loans purchased from the rtc 
the average balance of auto contracts increased from million in to million in principally resulting from the opening of new branch offices and the purchasing of additional dealer contracts in these new market areas 
the average balance of mortgage loans decreased from million in to million in as a result of the sale of some of these loans in the fourth quarter of non recurring gains on the sales of these loans of  were recorded in the increase in the average yield on earning assets is a direct result of the origination or purchase of higher yielding loans in  specifically auto contracts 
interest expense interest expense decreased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   due to a million decrease in average interest bearing liabilities  and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest component of the decline in interest bearing liabilities was deposits with the bank  which decreased from an average balance of million for to million for the average cost of deposits decreased from for to for provision for loan losses provision for loans losses increased from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase reflects additional loss provisions associated with our insurance premium finance business  primarily as a result of higher charge offs in compared with annualized net charge offs to average loans were in compared to in all loan loss provisions related to our mortgage finance business were reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while we believe that we have adequately provided for losses and do not expect any material loss on our loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income non interest income decreased  from million in to  in the decrease resulted from  of non recurring loan sale gains in on loans purchased from the resolution trust corporation in and other components of non interest income include fees and charges for bank services and miscellaneous other income

residual interests in securitizations consist of beneficial interests in the form of an interest only strip representing the subordinated right to receive cash flows from a pool of securitized loans after payment of required amounts to the holders of the securities and certain costs associated with the securitization 
our residual interests of million at december  were recorded in connection with two securitizations completed in valuations of the residual interests are based on discounted cash flow analyses using prepayment and default assumptions that market participants would use for similar instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risks 
premises and equipment decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily as a result of discontinuing our mortgage finance division and writing off fixed assets and leasehold improvements associated with this business

shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december   principally as a result of our net loss of million and million related to the repurchase of stock by upfc 
management of interest rate risk the principal objective of our interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given our operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the asset liability position of upfc  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
upfc s profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans it originates and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
in addition  between the time we originate loans and investors sales commitments are received  we may be exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that interest rates move upward or downward during the time the loans are held for sale 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management  through the use of a model  which estimates the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we review a market value model the ots npv model prepared quarterly by the ots  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s npv under various scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule for thrifts 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure  as defined by the ots  in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
at september   the most recent date for which the relevant ots npv model is available  the bank s sensitivity measure resulting from a basis point decrease in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million increase in the npv of the bank and a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
at september   the bank s sensitivity measure was below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at september  and december  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and basis points bp 
these tables are based on data prepared by the ots 
we make no representation as to the accuracy of this data

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we have continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently  and we have always met or exceeded this requirement 
management  through its asset and liability committee  monitors rates and terms of competing sources of funds to use the most cost effective source of funds wherever possible 
sales and securitizations of loans were one of the primary sources of funds for the discontinued subprime mortgage operations 
cash flows from sales and securitizations of loans were million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million during the twelve months ended december  another source of funds consists of deposits obtained through the bank s retail branches in california 
the bank offers checking accounts  various money market accounts  regular passbook accounts and fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities and retirement accounts 
deposit account terms vary by interest rate  minimum balance requirements and the duration of the account 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank periodically  based on liquidity and financing requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal regulations 
at december   such retail deposits were million or of total deposits 
the bank uses wholesale and broker originated deposits to supplement its retail deposits and  at december   wholesale deposits were million or of total deposits 
the bank solicits wholesale deposits by posting its interest rates on a national on line service  which advertises the bank s wholesale products to investors 
generally  most of the wholesale deposit account holders are institutional investors  commercial businesses or public sector entities 
broker deposits are originated through major dealers specializing in such products 
included in wholesale deposits at december  are million of broker originated deposits

however  as a result of these shorter term deposits  the rates on these accounts may be more sensitive to movements in market interest rates  which may result in a higher cost of funds 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with tangible capital of million  or of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or and risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or under the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia  the bank is deemed to be well capitalized at december  upfc has other sources of liquidity  including fhlb advances and the liquidity and short term securities portfolio 
through the bank  we may obtain advances from the fhlb  collateralized by securities  mortgage loans purchased from the rtc and the bank s fhlb stock 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for thrifts and certain other member financial institutions 
advances are made pursuant to several programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
limitations on the amount of advances are based generally on a fixed percentage of net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of an institution s credit worthiness

our asset review committee reviews for classification all problem and potential problem assets and reports the results of its review to the board of directors quarterly 
we have incorporated the ots internal asset classifications as a part of our credit monitoring systems and in order of increasing weakness  these designations are substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  questionable and there is a high possibility of loss 
loss assets are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted 
assets  which do have weaknesses but do not currently have sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the categories described above  are designated as special mention 
at december   we had million of assets classified as special mention  million of assets classified as substandard   of assets classified as doubtful and no assets classified as loss

upfc s general policy is to discontinue accrual of interest on a mortgage loan when it is two payments or more delinquent  accordingly  loans are placed on non accrual status generally when they are days delinquent 
a non mortgage loan is charged off or placed on nonaccrual status when it is delinquent for days or more 
when a loan is reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status  all previously accrued interest is reversed 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received or the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is in accordance with the loan terms  at which time the loan is returned to accrual status 
accounts  which are deemed fully or partially uncollectible  by management  are generally fully reserved or charged off for the amount that exceeds the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the underlying collateral 
we do not generally modify  extend or rewrite loans and at december  had no troubled debt restructured loans

these allowances include specific reserves for identifiable impairments of individual loans and general valuation allowances for estimates of probable losses not specifically identified 
in addition  our allowance for loan losses is also increased by the allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
no loan loss provision is made for loans held for sale 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of non performing loans  the concentration of credit  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
upfc s management uses its best judgment in providing for possible loan losses and establishing allowances for loan losses 
however  the allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to increase the allowance based upon their judgment of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
cash equivalents and securities portfolio upfc s cash equivalents and securities portfolios are used primarily for liquidity and for investment income

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of upfc are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
