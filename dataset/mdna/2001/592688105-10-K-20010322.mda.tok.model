item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with net sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive solution offering  the quality of our global sales and service network  our continued investment in product development  our pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on opportunities in developed and emerging markets 
while all of our businesses have significant strategic links in terms of technology or customer base  we have a geographically diverse business which serves customers in relatively healthy and stable end markets  including the pharmaceutical  biotech and food industries 
our financial information is presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
net sales in local currency increased in  in and in the strengthening of the us dollar versus our major trading currencies reduced us dollar reported sales growth in each year 
net sales in us dollars increased in  in and in in  we had local currency sales growth of in europe  in the americas and in asia and other markets 
we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base 
these include the need for increased efficiency for example  in accelerating time to market for new products  achieving better yields  improving work processes and outsourcing non core activities  the desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management information systems  the drive for ever higher quality of our customers products and services  including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards  and the move towards globalization in all major customer groups 
acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy 
our acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we are particularly attracted to acquisitions which leverage these attributes or increase our solutions capability for example  software acquisitions 
in addition  we are most attracted to the following end markets drug discovery  process analytics  food and drug packaging and transportation and logistics 
we increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs as a percentage of net sales from in to in this improved performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
we believe that a significant portion of the increase in our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to reduce costs  re engineer our operations and focus on the highest value added segments of the markets in which we compete 
recent acquisitions in  we acquired berger instruments  thornton inc and avs 
we also increased our shareholding in cargoscan to 
berger instruments  based in delaware  usa  is the market leader in supercritical fluid chromatography sfc  a high performance technology used to analyze and purify chemical compounds during drug discovery 
berger instruments is an excellent complement to our portfolio of automated drug discovery solutions 
we already have a leading position in sample preparation and synthesis 
purification is the next process step after synthesis 
berger allows us to further our strategy of providing solutions that automate and integrate the drug discovery process and therefore help our customers improve the efficiency  throughput and accuracy of their processes 
thornton inc  based in massachusetts  usa  is the leader in pure and ultra pure industrial water monitoring instrumentation used in semi conductor  micro electronics  pharmaceutical  and biotech applications 
we believe the acquisition of thornton is an excellent strategic move to expand our process analytics business and gain access to new markets 
their conductivity technology and know how are complementary to our strength in ph and oxygen measurements 
with a broader technology offering  we will be better able to serve our expanded customer base 
avs  uk based  is a leader in x ray visioning solutions used in the inspection of packaged goods 
we are the leading global provider of integrated end of line inspection solutions 
these high throughput solutions incorporate sensor technologies and software to assist customers in fulfilling validation requirements and in improving their quality and yield 
through avs  we add x ray based vision inspection  which is ideal for identifying non metallic contamination in packages and where metal packaging prevents detection by conventional means 
we feel that avs is an excellent strategic complement to our existing offering of metal detection  checkweighing and related quality control software systems 
cargoscan is the premier provider of dimensioning technology used by major express carriers  freight forwarders  third party logistic entities and distribution companies 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to serve this industry given our global presence and our technical knowledge of local regulatory requirements 
this transaction underscores our commitment to the transportation and logistics sector and will allow us the flexibility and faster decision making necessary to exploit the substantial growth of this market 
in  we acquired the testut lutrana group  a leading manufacturer and marketer of industrial and retail weighing instruments in france with annual sales of approximately million 
we believe this acquisition is an excellent strategic fit given testut lutrana s extensive sales and service network in france and excellent brand recognition 
by virtue of this acquisition  we assumed the leading position in food retail weighing in europe and are well positioned to meet the rapidly changing demands of our european customer base 
in  we also signed an agreement to convert our joint venture in changzhou  china  into a legal structure that provides us with full control 
through this change in ownership  we are able to fully leverage this low cost manufacturing base for international markets 
this move underscores our strategic commitment to asia and our belief in the fundamental growth factors for the region 
in  we acquired three technologically advanced instrument companies in the drug discovery sector applied systems  bohdan automation inc and myriad 
applied systems designs  assembles and markets instruments for in process molecular analysis  which is primarily used for researching  developing and monitoring chemical processes 
applied systems proprietary sensors  together with its innovative fourier transform infrared technology  enable chemists to analyze chemical reactions as they occur  which is more efficient than pulling samples 
bohdan is a leading supplier of laboratory automation and automated synthesis products to the automated drug and chemical compound discovery market used in research for life science applications 
myriad designs  assembles and markets instruments that facilitate and automate the synthesis of large numbers of chemical compounds in parallel  which is a key step in the chemical compound discovery process 
its products can be used in all stages of synthesis in drug discovery 
cost reduction programs as part of our efforts to reduce costs  we evaluate from time to time the cost effectiveness of our global manufacturing strategy 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
over the next few years  we also intend to continue to develop china as a low cost manufacturing resource and to seek other manufacturing cost saving opportunities 
in this respect  we recorded a charge of million in associated with the transfer of production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities 
these charges relate primarily to severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including lease termination costs and the write down of impaired assets 
we believe that the future cash benefits of these programs will exceed the costs  although the cash outflows will precede the cash flow benefits 
activities related to the charge recorded in were significantly completed in in  we launched a worldwide procurement project 
the project is intended to eliminate price differences between units  leverage potential opportunities to increase buying power  and establish worldwide sourcing arrangements 
we envision it will take at least two years to obtain anticipated benefits from this project 
during  we also exited our glass batching business based in belgium 
in this respect  we incurred losses of million during primarily for severance and other costs of exiting this business 
we completed our exit of the glass batching business by the end of results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands 
a b net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling  general and administrative    amortization    purchased research and development  interest expense    other charges  net c    earnings before taxes and minority interest    adjusted operating income d    a in connection with acquisitions in  including the acquisition of the testut lutrana group  we allocated of the purchase price to revalue certain inventories principally work in progress and finished goods to fair value net realizable value 
substantially all such inventories were sold during the second quarter of b in connection with the bohdan acquisition  we allocated  based upon independent valuations   of the purchase price to purchased research and development in process 
this amount was recorded as an expense immediately following the bohdan acquisition 
c other charges  net generally includes interest income  foreign currency transactions  gains losses from sales of assets and other items 
the amount also includes a charge of  related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
the amount includes a gain on an asset sale of approximately  a charge of  to transfer production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities and losses of approximately  in connection with the exit from our glass batching business based in belgium 
for the years ended december  and  the amount shown also includes and  respectively  of expenses incurred on behalf of certain selling shareholders in connection with our secondary offerings in and  respectively 
d adjusted operating income is defined as operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization and non recurring costs 
non recurring costs which have been excluded are the costs set forth in note a above 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our operating performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe increased in local currencies during  versus the prior year 
the increase reflected organic growth in our business and the effect of the testut lutrana acquisition 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during reflect strong sales performance in china and japan 
the operating results for testut lutrana which were included in our results from may  would have had the effect of increasing our net sales by an additional million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and  before non recurring acquisition costs in during  we experienced an increase in certain raw material costs  including electronics 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the prior year 
this decrease is the result of exchange rate movements 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year 
adjusted operating income increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the period excludes the previously noted non recurring acquisition charge of million for the revaluation of inventories to fair value 
the increased operating profit reflected the benefits of higher sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to reduced debt levels 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the amount includes a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
the amount also included a gain on an asset sale of million  charges of million regarding the transfer of production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities  losses of million to exit our glass batching business based in belgium and a charge of million relating to the secondary offering completed in our effective tax rate of before non recurring items in was consistent with the previous year 
net earnings were million in  compared to million in  before the million charge to close down and consolidate operations in  and expenses for the secondary offering  acquisition charges and the million charge to transfer production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities in this represents an increase of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe increased in local currencies during  versus the prior year 
the increase largely reflected the effect of testut lutrana  as well as organic growth in our business 
net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased principally due to organic growth in our business  as well as the effect of businesses acquired 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during primarily represented improved economic conditions throughout the region  which began in the fourth quarter of the operating results for testut lutrana which were included in our results from may  would have had the effect of increasing our net sales by an additional million in  if included from may  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for  before non recurring acquisition costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for the prior year 
the increase primarily reflected increased research and development activity related to product introductions  as well as the effect of acquired businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year 
adjusted operating income increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the period excludes the previously noted non recurring acquisition charge of million for the revaluation of inventories to fair value 
the increased operating margin reflected the benefits of higher sales levels and our continuous efforts to improve productivity 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to reduced debt levels 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the and amounts included charges of million and million relating to the secondary offerings completed in and  respectively 
the amount also included a gain on an asset sale of million  charges of million regarding the transfer of production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities and losses of million to exit our glass batching business based in belgium 
the amount also included gains on asset sales offset by other charges 
our tax rate in before non recurring items was consistent with the prior year  excluding a benefit of approximately percentage points or million based upon a one time change in swiss tax law which benefited only the period 
the period also included non deductible purchased research and development charges incurred in connection with the bohdan acquisition 
net earnings before expenses for the secondary offerings  acquisition charges and the million charge to transfer production lines from the americas to china and europe and the closure of facilities were million in  compared to million in this represents an increase of almost  excluding the one time tax benefit of million received in liquidity and capital resources at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash  was million 
we had borrowings of million under our credit agreement and million under various other arrangements as of december  of our credit agreement borrowings  approximately million was borrowed as term loans scheduled to mature in and million was borrowed under a multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million at december  changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
under the credit agreement  amounts outstanding under the term loans are payable in quarterly installments 
in addition  the credit agreement obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness and with certain excess cash flow 
the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  including restrictions and limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders  incur indebtedness  make investments  grant liens  sell financial assets and engage in certain other activities 
we must also comply with several financial covenants 
the credit agreement is secured by most of our assets 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in resulted principally from a one time payment of million associated with an early retirement plan from previous years  as well as an increase in inventory levels associated with product introductions  production transfers and increased safety stocks of electronics 
in  we also increased our accounts payable terms with many suppliers to improve our working capital efficiency 
this resulted in an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in we maintained these payment terms in  and therefore  accounts payables were not a source of cash in during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  including approximately million of additional consideration related to earn out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in december of  seller financing of million and working capital retained by sellers 
these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  we expect to make additional earn out payments relating to certain of these acquisitions in the future 
capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows  and fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with borrowings available under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for at least several years  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside of switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
in recent years  the swiss franc and other european currencies have generally moved in a consistent manner versus the us dollar 
therefore  because the two effects previously described have offset each other  our operating profits have not been materially affected by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus european currencies 
however  there can be no assurance that these currencies will continue to move in a consistent manner in the future 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
european economic and monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  switzerland is not part of the emu 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro 
we have recognized the introduction of the euro as a significant event with potential implications for existing operations 
currently  we operate in all of the participating countries in the emu 
we expect nonparticipating european union countries  where we also have operations  may eventually join the emu 
we have committed resources to conduct risk assessments and to take corrective actions  where required  to ensure we are prepared for the introduction of the euro 
we have undertaken a review of the euro implementation and have concentrated on areas such as operations  finance  treasury  legal  information management  procurement and others  both in participating and nonparticipating european union countries where we operate 
also  existing legacy accounting and business systems and other business assets have been reviewed for euro compliance  including assessing any risks from third parties 
progress regarding euro implementation is reported periodically to management 
because of the staggered introduction of the euro regarding non cash and cash transactions  we have developed our plans to address our accounting and business systems first and our business assets second 
we were euro compliant within our accounting and business systems by the end of and expect to be compliant within our other business assets prior to the introduction of the euro bills and coins 
compliance in participating and nonparticipating countries will be achieved primarily through upgraded systems  which were previously planned to be upgraded 
remaining systems will be modified to achieve compliance 
we do not currently expect to experience any significant operational disruptions or to incur any significant costs  including any currency risk  which could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we are preparing plans to address issues within the transitional period when both legacy and euro currencies may be used 
we continue to assess our pricing strategy throughout europe due to the increased price transparency created by the euro and are attempting to adjust prices in some of our markets 
we are also encouraging our suppliers  even in switzerland  to commence transacting in the euro 
we do not believe that the effect of these adjustments will be material 
we have a disproportionate amount of our costs in swiss francs relative to sales 
historically  the potential currency impact has been muted because currency fluctuations between the swiss franc and other major european currencies have been minimal and there is greater balance between total european including swiss sales and costs 
however  if the introduction of the euro results in a significant weakening of the euro against the swiss franc  our financial performance could be harmed 
the statements set forth herein concerning the introduction of the euro which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
in particular  the costs associated with our euro programs and the time frame in which we plan to complete euro modifications are based upon management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events 
there can be no guarantee that any estimates or other forward looking statements will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income  and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of future costs of environmental compliance 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china  latin america and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  if our presence in china  latin america and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
seasonality our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge short term intercompany balances with our foreign businesses 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million net reduction in the net aggregate market value of these instruments  as compared with million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our net investments 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on such debt at december  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the swiss franc  the fair value of such debt would increase by million  as compared with million at december  any changes in fair value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive income and offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange changes on the net investments which they hedge 
new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission staff released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements and associated risks this annual report includes forward looking statements based on our current expectations and projections about future events  including strategic plans  potential growth  including penetration of developed markets and opportunities in emerging markets  planned product introductions  planned operational changes and research and development efforts  euro conversion issues  future financial performance  including expected capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  potential acquisitions  impact of completed acquisitions  future cash sources and requirements  liquidity  impact of environmental costs  and potential cost savings 
these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those identified in exhibit to our annual report on form k  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated and certain of which are beyond our control 
the words believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results
