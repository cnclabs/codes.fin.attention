item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report 
general we generate revenues primarily through sales of otc drugs and prescription pharmaceutical products  health and beautycare products  food and beverage items  tobacco products  cosmetics  housewares  hosiery  greeting cards  photofinishing  photo supplies and seasonal merchandise 
health and beauty care products  including otc drugs  represent our largest product categories 
our primary costs and expenses are inventory costs  labor expenses and occupancy costs 
we have sales per square foot of in fiscal and in fiscal we believe that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing our performance to that of our competitors because it is a measure of a store s sales productivity 
we currently expect that our sales per square foot may decline as we continue with our plan to increase new store openings during fiscal the opening of these additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales 
we believe that our competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons 
over the next two years  we plan to open to stores  of which approximately two thirds will be located outside of our primary market of manhattan  nyc 
on september   we purchased substantially all of the operating assets  including inventory and leases  of rock bottom stores  inc  a drugstore chain of stores operating primarily in the outer boroughs of new york city 
we currently operate of these stores  having sold or closed the remaining nine 
our primary assets are our ownership of of the outstanding partnership interest of duane reade  a new york general partnership  and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of dri i inc dri i inc 
owns the remaining partnership interest in duane reade 
substantially all of our operations are conducted through duane reade 
in august  we established two new subsidiaries  duane reade international and duane reade realty 
duane reade distributed to duane reade inc and dri i inc 
all rights  title  and interest in all its trademarks  trade names and all other intellectual property rights 
in turn  duane reade inc and dri i inc 
made a capital contribution of these intellectual property rights to duane reade international 
this change created a controlled system to manage these intellectual property rights separate and apart from the retail operations 
in addition  duane reade distributed some of its store leases to duane reade inc and dri i inc  which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to duane reade realty 
duane reade realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation 
duane reade realty subleases to duane reade the properties subject to those leases 
results of operations the following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

pharmacy and front end comparable sales increased by and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for  resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to for from for the decrease in gross margin resulted principally from the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales and the inclusion of the rd week in  which included a significant portion of post holiday markdowns not included in the previous week year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of sales reflects the favorable leveraging of store operating costs from maturing retail sites  as well as the leveraging of general and administrative expenses against new and comparative store sales growth 
depreciation and amortization of intangibles in and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during and as well as amortization expenses for goodwill  pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during and this was partially offset by reduced amortization expenses related to a million reduction of goodwill in the fourth quarter of  and a change in the estimated useful life of pharmacy customer list acquisitions from to years 
store pre opening expenses of million related to the opening of stores in as compared to million reflecting store openings in net interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowing and higher interest rates during our income before income taxes increased to million in from million in during  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which included certain wage related income tax credits  resulting in an effective tax rate of

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for  resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to for from for the decrease in gross margin resulted principally from pharmacy sales making up a greater percentage of total sales and the impact of lower gross margins in the rock bottom stores acquired in september selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales and million or of net sales in and  respectively 
the large number of new and immature stores  along with the increased proportion of higher cost pharmacy business  offset the favorable leveraging of expenses associated with sales growth 
the increase in depreciation and amortization of intangibles from million in to million in resulted principally from capital spending on property and equipment during and as well as full year amortization and depreciation expenses related to identifiable intangibles  goodwill and property and equipment associated with the rock bottom stores acquisition in september in addition  amortization expenses increased due to the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of a portion of the love s store chain in may store pre opening expenses decreased from million in to million in due to the opening of new stores in compared to in net interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowing and higher interest rates during our income before income taxes increased to million in from million in during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves  which were partially offset by the income tax provision for fiscal year we were not required to record an income tax provision in  as there was no taxable income and our net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax asset had a valuation reserve of 
during we recorded a million extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt 
we recorded net income of million in  compared to a net loss of million in the increase of million is a result of higher gross profit as a result of higher sales  the extraordinary charge recorded in  and the income tax benefit recorded in  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses  amortization and depreciation expense 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we successfully completed an initial public offering  which was part of a plan to refinance all of our then existing indebtedness in order to enhance financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements 
this plan resulted in a reduction in our overall indebtedness  a simplification of our capital structure and access to additional borrowings 
the principal components of this plan were our sale of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  the execution of a new secured credit agreement  which provided for borrowings up to approximately million million of term loans and up to million of revolving loans  our issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  for net proceeds of approximately million  the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our former credit agreement  the outstanding principal amount of which was million as of december   the redemption of our outstanding zero coupon senior subordinated notes due and the redemption of our outstanding senior notes due on august   in connection with the rock bottom acquisition  our credit agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan borrowings of million 
on september   also in connection with the rock bottom acquisition  the credit agreement was amended and restated to increase available term loan borrowings by million  bringing the total permitted borrowings under our credit agreement to million million of term loans and up to million of revolving loans 
on march   in connection with additional planned pharmacy acquisitions and capital spending requirements  the credit agreement was amended and restated again to increase available borrowings by million to million million of term loans and million of revolving loans 
on december  the credit agreement was amended to increase permitted revolving loan borrowings to million of which million was actually made available to us at december  on january  and february  available revolver borrowings were increased by million and million respectively  bringing total available revolver borrowings to million 
on march   in order to provide us with additional availability of capital for general working capital needs  the credit agreement was amended and restated to permit available term loan borrowings to increase by up to million of which million was actually made available to us 
in addition  available revolver borrowings were increased by million  bringing total available borrowings under the credit agreement to million million of term loans and million of revolver loans 
we used the additional million proceeds of the term loans to reduce revolver borrowings 
on october   the remaining million resulting from the march  credit agreement restatement was made available  bringing total term loan borrowing to million 
the additional funds were again used to reduce revolver borrowings 
on october   the credit agreement was restated to allow for an additional million of term loan borrowing  of which million was made available 
this increased our total available borrowings to million million of term loans and million of revolver loans 
the proceeds of this transaction were applied to the balance of the revolving credit line 
working capital was million as of december  and million as of december  the increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the opening of additional stores during  and increases in accounts receivable due to additional volume and an increase in the proportion of third party prescription sales 
our ebitda increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in ebitda as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in net cash provided was increased earnings from operations partially offset by increases in working capital related to inventory for new stores  accounts receivable and the timing of the year end at december  versus december  as a result of the additional week and later year end date in  certain disbursements such as sales tax and payroll were paid prior to the year end date in  whereas they were paid after year end in for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in was for capital expenditures of million primarily related to new store openings and the remodeling and renovation of other stores  combined with million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs 
net cash used in investing activities in was due to capital expenditures of million  million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs  million to purchase six love s stores and a pasteur pharmacy offset by proceeds of million from the sale of assets 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million in fiscal in both and  the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional borrowings under our credit agreement 
our capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores  remodeling and renovating existing retail locations and from the continuing development of management information systems 
we believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores  and currently plan to open approximately to stores during the next two years 
we expect to spend approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures  primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs 
we also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores 
historically  we have been able to lease our store locations 
leases for of our stores that generated approximately of our net sales for fiscal are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal we believe that we will be able to renew these leases on economically favorable terms or  alternatively  find other economically attractive locations to lease 
as of december   approximately  of our approximately  employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
pursuant to the terms of these collective bargaining agreements  we are required to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits to the member employees 
we do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 
we believe that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our credit agreement  will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
as of december   we had borrowed approximately million under the revolving portion of our bank credit agreement and had approximately million of remaining availability 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
substantially all of our borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
the credit agreement contains various covenants that limit or restrict  among other things  subject to certain exceptions  capital expenditures  the incurrence of indebtedness  the creation of liens  transactions with affiliates  restricted payments  investments and acquisitions  mergers  consolidations  dissolutions  asset sales  dividends  distributions  and certain other transactions and business activities by the company 
financial performance covenants include interest coverage  leverage ratios  minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial performance covenants 
on december   we entered into a two year interest rate swap in the notional amount of million 
this swap had an effective date of january  and represented a hedging transaction whereby we would receive interest at a floating rate and pay interest at a fixed libor rate 
the effect of this swap is to fix our interest obligations on million of floating rate debt for two years at a libor rate of plus the applicable margins as defined in the credit agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this agreement expires on january  tax benefits from net operating losses at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million  which are due to expire in the years through these nols may be used to offset future taxable income through and thereby reduce our federal income taxes otherwise payable 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes significant limitations on the utilization of nols in the event of an ownership change  as defined in section of the code 
this section limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre ownership change nols that a corporation may use to offset its post ownership change income 
the section limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before an ownership change by the long term tax exempt rate as published by the internal revenue service 
generally  an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more shareholders  including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least of that corporation s stock  exceeds percentage points over a three year testing period 
our recapitalization in caused us to experience an ownership change 
as a result  we currently are subject to an annual section limitation of approximately million in and approximately million from to on the amount of nols generated prior to the recapitalization that we may use to offset future taxable income 
at december  all of the existing nols were subject to this limitation 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to use any nols to offset future taxable income or that the nols will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes 
based on our recent and projected performance  however  management believes that it is more likely than not that the full value of the nols will be realized 
seasonality the non pharmacy business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an illustration of the effect of seasonality on our results of operations 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended december   however  most recent data available indicates that there has been a modest increase in the overall inflation levels impacting our business and there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material impact in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that derivative instruments such as options  forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative 
on december   the company entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million  with an effective date of january  the agreement was entered into as an interest rate hedging transaction and will effectively convert million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of interest based on libor 
the company is required to adopt statement no 
for the first quarter of the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
the adoption of sab had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
among other things  fin establishes criteria to determine whether modifications to the terms of existing stock option awards will result in compensation expense being recorded 
in addition  fin clarifies the criteria for determining whether a stock based plan is non compensatory 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates 
variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement was approximately million at december  during  in connection with the credit agreement requirements  we entered into an interest rate protection agreement which capped the libor rate at on million of our floating rate debt 
this agreement expired in november on december   we purchased a two year interest rate swap in the notional amount of million 
this swap has an effective date of january  and represented a hedging transaction to effectively convert million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
this fixed rate is equivalent to a libor rate of plus the applicable margins described in our credit agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the day libor rate at december  was 
based on the december  outstanding balances reduced by the million interest rate swap described above  a change in interest rates would affect pre tax annual results of operations by approximately million 
we also had million of senior notes outstanding at december  these notes  which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of  are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations 
the principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate our funding needs 
as part of our investment management  we may use additional derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future
