item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally engaged in the design  development and licensing of safety medical devices intended to reduce the incidence of accidental needlesticks 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from up front license payments made by becton dickinson 
on december   we entered into a license agreement with becton dickinson under which we licensed certain of our products to becton dickinson 
in connection with the agreement  we received an up front licensing fee of million in addition to the right to receive royalty payments based on becton dickinson s net sales of the licensed products 
in addition  the license agreement granted becton dickinson an option to license five of our other products 
on march   we signed a binding term letter with becton dickinson outlining the terms for a definitive agreement under which becton dickinson would license the products that we previously granted them an option to license 
we recognized million of revenue in the form of an up front licensing fee upon the signing of the binding term letter 
on may   we entered into a definitive license agreement with becton dickinson based upon the terms of the march  binding term letter 
under the definitive license agreement  we received an additional million in up front licensing fees and the right to receive royalty payments based on becton dickinson s net sales of the products licensed under such agreement 
on september   we entered into a license agreement with medamicus  inc granting medamicus a license to manufacture and market our safety seldinger needle for certain venous applications 
under the license agreement  we have the right to receive royalty payments based on medamicus net sales of the safety seldinger introducer needle 
several of the products licensed to becton dickinson are expected to launch in  and the safety seldinger needle is tentatively scheduled to launch in the summer of with the launch of these products  we anticipate the generation of royalty payments in under the becton dickinson and medamicus license agreements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december  was  we had no revenue for the revenue in consisted principally of  in up front licensing payments made by becton dickinson under the may  license agreement 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  as compared to loss from operations of  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due primarily to the receipt of license fee revenue in offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation expenses described below 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase in general and administrative expenses from was principally due to an increase in the general level of business activities  primarily related to increased legal and travel expenses  to enable the company to market its products

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to  for the corresponding period in the increase in general and administrative expenses from was principally due to an increase in legal and travel expenses resulting from increased business activity to enable the company to market its products 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to  for the corresponding period in research and development expenses remained fairly constant for years and stock based compensation was  in  a decrease of  as compared to  for the corresponding period in in  options and warrants were issued to an officer for services performed in  resulting in the difference 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  as compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to income from operations and cash received from the exercise of warrants and options of  offset principally by the repayment of short term borrowings of  the purchase of patents of  and increase in insurance premiums of approximately  cash provided by operating activities was most significantly affected by two offsetting matters 
our revenues in included  in licensing fees attributable to an advance payment that was received in because these revenues were recorded in a period subsequent to the period in which the payment was received  cash provided by operations was reduced by the amount of the  payment 
conversely  stock based compensation of  recorded by the company in reflected non cash expenditures and  accordingly  cash provided by operations was increased by this amount 
at december   we had a revolving line of credit totaling  this facility can be used to fund working capital needs and finance capital equipment purchases 
however  advances for capital equipment financing may not exceed  and borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
any borrowings to meet working capital needs bear interest at libor plus  while borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases bear interest at the prime rate plus 
the facility expires on may   and there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating a continuation of the availability of the line of credit or the terms that will be made available to us 
there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at december  we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
the availability of resources over a longer term will be dependent on our ability to enter into licensing agreements and to receive royalty payments from our current and future licensees and our ability to enter into  and profitably operate under joint venture or similar arrangements 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating additional agreements  or if licensing revenues are insufficient to support our operations  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit at december  if we were to borrow under our credit facility  borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus and borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  any such borrowings would be subject to the fluctuations in the market which affect libor or the prime rate  respectively
