item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company for the year ended december  was not material 
investment risk 
the company invests in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
since the company s initial investment  certain of these investments in privately held companies have become marketable equity securities upon the investees completing initial public offerings 
such investments  most of which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments 
for these investments in public and privately held companies  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   the net unrealized gains of million on these investments have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments 
the company invests in equity instruments of public companies  certain of which will be classified as derivatives  for business and strategic purposes and has classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in internet and technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
the company has realized gains and losses from both the sale of investments  as well as mergers and acquisitions of companies in which the company has invested 
as of december   the company had available for sale equity investments with a fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
the net unrealized gains of million have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to the company s earnings and cash flows 
beyond the control of the company  however  continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material non cash impact on the operating results of the company in future periods
