in january  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
under this authorization  the company may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions  depending on market price and other considerations 
on january   the board of directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program for up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
through february   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of million 
during  in connection with the share repurchase program  the company issued three separate option contracts under which the contract counterparties have the option to require the company to purchase an agreed upon number of shares of its common stock at a specific strike price per share 
the first option contract was issued in july and required the company to purchase  shares of its common stock on october  the company received a premium of million for issuing this contract which expired unexercised on october  the remaining two contracts  both issued in december  require the company to purchase  shares of its common stock on march  and  shares of its common stock on june  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company received premiums  in aggregate  of million for issuing these contracts 
as of february   the market value of the company s common stock exceeded the strike prices under the two open contracts 
the company s primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases as well as to fund capital expenditure requirements which are anticipated to be approximately million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new men s wearhouse stores and new k g stores in at an expected average cost per store of approximately  for the men s wearhouse stores and approximately  for the k g stores excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory

the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry and recent financial difficulties of significant menswear retailers may present the company with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than the company s past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
the company may use cash on hand  together with its cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
the company anticipates that its existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its various credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
in connection with the company s direct sourcing program  the company may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the euro 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
the majority of the forward exchange contracts are with five financial institutions 
therefore  the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated 
the company may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rates 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
at february   the company had contracts maturing in monthly increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency 
these forward contracts do not extend beyond july  at january   the company had contracts maturing in monthly increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency 
unrealized pretax losses on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at february  and approximately million at january  a hypothetical change in applicable february  forward rates would increase or decrease this pretax loss by approximately million related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
upon adoption of sfas in the first quarter of  the company will recognize a cumulative loss adjustment of million million  net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income related primarily to unrealized losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of the company s canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of the company s canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
the company is also subject to market risk due to its long term floating rate term loan of million at february  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase the company s interest expense and its cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase the company s interest expense and payments by approximately million
