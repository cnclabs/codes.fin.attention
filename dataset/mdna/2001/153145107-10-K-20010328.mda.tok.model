this entire annual report should be read to put such forward looking statements in context and to gain a more complete understanding of the uncertainties and risks involved in the company s business 
therefore  the information set forth therein should be carefully considered when evaluating the business prospects of the company and the bank 
business organization central coast bancorp the company is a california corporation  located in salinas  california and was organized in to act as a bank holding company for bank of salinas 
in  the company acquired cypress bank  which was headquartered in seaside  california 
both banks were state charted institutions 
in july of  the company merged cypress bank into the bank of salinas and then renamed bank of salinas as community bank of central california the bank 
as of december   the bank operated ten full service branch offices and one limited service branch office 
the bank is headquartered in salinas and serves individuals  merchants  small and medium sized businesses  professionals  agribusiness enterprises and wage earners located in the tri county area of monterey  san benito and santa cruz 
in december  the former bank of salinas opened an additional new branch office in salinas  california  to better provide services to the growing salinas community 
in june of  the bank opened a new branch office in watsonville  which is in santa cruz county 
in october of  another new branch office was opened in hollister  which is in san benito county 
the opening of these two branch offices was a first step in expanding the bank s service area to include communities outside of monterey county 
both of these communities are of similar economic make up to the agricultural based communities the bank serves in monterey county 
other than holding the shares of the subsidiary bank  the company conducts no significant activities 
although  it is authorized  with the prior approval of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the board of governors  the company s principal regulator  to engage in a variety of activities which are deemed closely related to the business of banking 
the following analysis is designed to enhance the reader s understanding of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for additional detailed information 
average balances  including such balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances for the company 
except within the overview section  interest income and net interest income are presented on a tax equivalent basis 
overview for the th consecutive year  central coast bancorp earned record net income on a year over year basis 
net income in increased to  versus  in diluted earnings per share for was  up from the reported for for  the company realized a return on average equity of and a return on average assets of  as compared to and for the earnings per share for and have been adjusted for the percent stock dividend distributed on february  during  total assets of the company increased  to a total of  at year end 
at december   loans totaled  up  from the ending balances on december  deposit growth in  net of returning  of state of california certificates of deposit  was  resulting in ending deposit balances of  the bank s growth in total assets  loans and deposits reflected in the previous paragraph came from the hard work and dedication of our employees 
in a time when many banks have been struggling to maintain customer relationships and their deposit base  community bank was able to exceed its growth goals for the year 
every one of the existing branch offices exceeded their deposit growth goals for most of the branch offices also exceeded their loan goals 
the two new branch offices in hollister and watsonville have been well received as their staffs immersed themselves in exposing those communities to the benefits of banking with community bank 
in both of the new branch offices  deposit and loan growth exceeded the business plan forecasts 
in its continuing quest to offer products and services to make banking more convenient for the customer  the bank introduced anytime online its internet banking product in the spring of this product compliments and expands on the functionality of anytime teller  a hour banking by telephone product  which was introduced in both systems provide a quick and easy way for both business and retail customers to check balances and account activity  transfer funds between accounts  make loan payments and order statements 
online banking provides the functionality to pay bills  open accounts  issue stop payments  purchase savings bonds and more 
anytime online can be viewed at the bank s web site address  www 
community bnk 
com 
these products along with the visa check card  which was introduced in late  have been well received by the bank s customers 
as internet only banks are discovering  bricks and mortar are necessary to build an effective franchise 
we believe that branch offices are the building blocks of community bank 
these business units with their front line employees are critical in providing the service that gives us a competitive edge against large impersonal financial institutions 
as we go forward  a critical component of our strategic plan is to expand our branch office base 
we believe this strategy will provide continued growth and the ability to achieve above average returns for our shareholders 
a results of operations net interest income net interest margin fully taxable equivalent net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets loans  securities and federal funds sold over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets

this increase contributed an additional  to interest income 
from july  through may   the federal reserve board raised interest rates six times for a total of basis points 
the higher interest rates increased the average yield on loans basis points  which added  to interest income 
the securities portfolio average balances decreased  which offset the increases in interest income by  the average yield received on securities was up basis points and added  to interest income 
federal funds sold interest income increased  due to both higher average balances and higher rates 
interest income on variable rate loans and federal funds quickly reflect rate changes 
during january of  the federal reserve board twice decreased the federal funds interest rates by basis points for a total reduction of 
this reduction will negatively impact interest income in and it may affect the bank s ability to attain interest income growth rates achieved in the past two years 
interest expense increased  in over the average balances of interest bearing liabilities increased  
the higher average balances resulted from a  increase in time deposits offset in part by an  decrease in interest bearing checking accounts

this compares to a maximum of  in in early november  the last of the state deposits matured 
interest paid on time certificates in increased  which accounted for most of the overall increase in interest expense 
interest expense attributable to the higher volume in time deposits was  and the higher rates added  average rates paid on time certificates were basis points higher in rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities were basis points higher in than in interest paid on interest bearing liabilities generally adjusts more slowly in response to market rate changes as time deposits and borrowings adjust at maturity

provision for loan losses in  the bank provided  for loan losses as compared to  in in providing for the allowance for loan losses the company considered the significant growth in the loan portfolio of   geographic and industry concentrations  expansion into new geographic markets  and volatility and weaknesses in the local economy  including potential effects of power shortages  water supply  and volatile market prices for agricultural products 
in addition  approximately million was provided as a result of the downward classification to substandard of several loans to a single borrower

consequently  the bank made provisions for loan losses of only  service charges and fees and other income noninterest income was up  in over the same period in service charges and fees related to deposit accounts increased  due to higher volumes  the full year effect of new fees implemented in late and new products 
noninterest income was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of as the bank realized a loss of  on the sale and repositioning of investment securities

several new fees were implemented late in these new fees added about  of the increase 
the remainder was due to higher volumes 
other income increased only  from the level 
this change reflected some good growth in certain service fees that was offset in part by lower mortgage origination fees due to the higher mortgage interest rates and reduced up charges on bank supplied check stock 
salaries and benefits salary and benefit expenses increased  in over salary expenses related to the staffing of the two new branch offices opened in the second half of the year accounted for  of the increase

for the rest of the company occupancy and fixed assets expense increased  
much of the increase is attributable to the full year effect of the relocation of two branch offices and remodeling of one branch office and operations office space during occupancy and fixed assets expense increased  in much of the increase was attributable to the remodeling of two branch offices and operations office space during the year as well as the full year of westridge operations and upgrades to the mis systems and computer network

these include one time costs of approximately  associated with merging bank of salinas and cypress bank

the effective tax rate of the company was higher in over as tax exempt instruments were a smaller percentage of earning assets 
in  the effective tax rate of the company was reduced from the prior year as a result of investments made in tax qualified municipal bonds 
the effective tax rate was greater than the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense of   and  in these years 
tax exempt income of   and  from investment securities and loans in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate 
b balance sheet analysis central coast bancorp s total assets at december  were  compared to  at december   representing an increase of 
the average balances of total assets of  in represent an increase of  or over  in loans the bank concentrates its lending activities in four principal areas commercial loans including agricultural loans  consumer loans  real estate construction loans both commercial and personal and real estate other loans 
at december   these four categories accounted for approximately   and of the bank s loan portfolio  respectively  as compared to   and at december  the year saw continuing high levels of economic activity in the bank s market area 
loan demand was strong throughout the year and remained so in the first months of all categories of loans  except consumer  reflect increased growth in the largest growth took place in the real estate other category 
however  the largest percentage gain of was in the real estate construction category 
table three summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio for the past five years as of december table three loan portfolio composite in thousands commercial      real estate construction      other      consumer      deferred loans fees total loans      allowance for loan losses      total      the majority of the bank s loans are direct loans made to individuals  local businesses and agri businesses 
the bank relies substantially on local promotional activity  personal contacts by bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the bank makes loans to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose  a viable repayment source and a plan of repayment established at inception and generally backed by a secondary source of repayment 
commercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs  loans for equipment purchases  working capital  and various other business loan products 
consumer loans include a range of traditional consumer loan products offered by the bank such as personal lines of credit and loans to finance purchases of autos  boats  recreational vehicles  mobile homes and various other consumer items 
the construction loans are generally composed of commitments to customers within the bank s service area for construction of both commercial properties and custom and semi custom single family residences 
other real estate loans consist primarily of loans to the bank s depositors secured by first trust deeds on commercial and residential properties typically with short term maturities and original loan to value ratios not exceeding 
in general  except in the case of loans with sba guarantees  the bank does not make long term mortgage loans  however  the bank has informal arrangements in place with mortgage lenders to assist customers in securing single family mortgage financing 
average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over the favorable economic conditions provided the impetus for continuing loan growth 
average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over risk elements the bank assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through stringent credit review and approval policies  extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies 
additionally  the bank contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically grade new loans and to review the existing loan portfolio 
management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the company s loan portfolio is critical for profitability and growth 
management strives to continue the historically low level of loan losses by continuing its emphasis on credit quality in the loan approval process  active credit administration and regular monitoring 
with this in mind  management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
ultimately  the credit quality of the bank s loans may be influenced by underlying trends in the national and local economic and business cycles 
the bank s business is mostly concentrated in monterey county 
the county s economy is highly dependent on the agricultural and tourism industries 
the agricultural industry is also the major driver of the economies of san benito county and the southern portion of santa cruz county where the bank s two newest branches are located 
as a result  the bank lends money to individuals and companies dependent upon the agricultural and tourism industries 
the bank has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit which are secured by real estate  totaling approximately million at december  although management believes this real estate concentration has no more that the normal risk of collectability  a substantial decline in the economy in general  or a decline in real estate values in the bank s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans 
the ultimate recovery of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation  sale or refinancing of the real estate 
the bank monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans 
when  in management s judgement  these loans are impaired  an appropriate provision for losses is recorded 
the more significant assumptions management considers involve estimates of the following lease  absorption and sale rates  real estate values and rates of return  operating expenses  inflation  and sufficiency of collateral independent of the real estate including  in limited instances  personal guarantees 
not withstanding the foregoing  abnormally high rates of impairment due to general local economic conditions could adversely affect the company s future prospects and results of operations 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the bank generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the bank s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the bank secures its collateral by perfecting its interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
loan losses from lending transactions related to real estate and agriculture compare favorably with the bank s loan losses on its loan portfolio as a whole 
management believes that its lending policies and underwriting standards will tend to minimize losses in an economic downturn  however  there is no assurance that losses will not occur under such circumstances 
the bank s loan policies and underwriting standards include  but are not limited to  the following maintaining a thorough understanding of the bank s service area and limiting investments outside of this area  maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers knowledge and capacity in their field of expertise  basing real estate construction loan approval not only on salability of the project  but also on the borrowers capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not sell within the original projected time period  and maintaining conforming and prudent loan to value and loan to cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the bank s construction lending officers 
in addition  the bank strives to diversify the risk inherent in the construction portfolio by avoiding concentrations to individual borrowers and on any one project 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  collection appears unlikely 
table four sets forth nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  and restructured loans performing in compliance with modified terms  for december table four non performing loans in thousands past due days or more and still accruing commercial real estate  consumer and other nonaccrual commercial real estate  consumer and other restructured in compliance with modified terms commercial  total nonperforming loans    interest due but excluded from interest income on nonaccrual loans was approximately  in   in and  in in and  interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans was  and  respectively none was recognized in 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered impaired was  of which  is included in nonaccrual loans  and  is included in restructured loans above 
such impaired loans had a valuation allowance of  the average recorded investment in impaired loans during was  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of   and  in  and  respectively including interest income of  on restructured loans in 
there were no troubled debt restructurings or loan concentrations in excess of of total loans not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans as of december  management is not aware of any potential problem loans  which were accruing and current at december   where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 
the company held no real estate acquired by foreclosure at december  or allowance for loan losses activity the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loans outstanding 
this allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
management determines an appropriate provision based upon the interaction of three primary factors the loan portfolio growth in the period  a comprehensive grading and review formula for total loans outstanding  and actual previous charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans at december  compared to  or at december  and  or at december  in  the allowance for loan losses was increased in consideration of the significant growth in the loan portfolio of   geographic and industry concentrations  expansion into new geographic markets  and volatility and weaknesses in the local economy  including potential effects of power shortages  water supply  and volatile market prices for agricultural products 
in addition  approximately million was provided as a result of the downward classification to substandard of several loans to a single borrower 
in  the loan growth of  necessitated an increase of  in the allowance for loan losses 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for known and future risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss potential  including economic factors  overall credit quality  historical delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss provision and allowance is prudent and adequate 
however  no prediction of the ultimate level of loans charged off in future years can be made with any certainty 
table five summarizes  for the years indicated  the activity in the allowance for loan losses

these deposits matured by the end of and were no longer included in the deposit balances 
thus  the deposit growth in  net of the  of state of california certificates of deposit  was  
because there was a large influx of demand deposits at year end  management would expect that due to normal seasonal variations deposits will decrease approximately  to  in the first quarter of capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
since october of and through december   the board of directors of the company has authorized two separate plans to repurchase up to in each plan of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
purchases are made from time to time  in the open market and negotiated transactions and are subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
the company acquired  shares of its common stock in the open market during   in and  in at average prices of approximately  and per share  respectively 
the company completed repurchases under the first plan in may at december   there were  shares remaining to repurchase under the second plan 
the preceding common share amounts and average prices paid have been adjusted for the stock split and stock dividends issued from february through february these repurchases are made with the intention to lessen the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock option plans as well as for capital management objectives 
the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or from the previous year end 
the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was at december   compared to at december  tier risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was at december   compared to at december  the capital ratios are lower in as compared to as risked based assets grew at a higher rate than did capital 
table seven capital ratios as of december  tier capital total capital leverage see the discussion of capital requirements in supervision and regulation on page and note in the financial statements included in item inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing  or other commercial concerns  primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary 
in general  inflation primarily affects the company indirectly through its effect on market rates of interest  and thus the ability of the bank to attract loan customers 
inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand  and potentially adversely affects the company s capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which the company may generate in the future 
in addition to its effects on interest rates  inflation directly affects the company by increasing the company s operating expenses 
inflation did not have a material effect upon the company s results of operations during the year market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast earnings  net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  the company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared quarterly using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liabilities ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
the forecast balance sheet is processed against three interest rate scenarios 
the scenarios include a basis point rising rate forecast  a flat rate forecast and a basis point falling rate forecast which take place within a one year time frame 
the net interest income is measured during the first year of the rate changes and in the year following the rate changes 
the company s net interest income  as forecast below  was modeled utilizing a forecast balance sheet projected from year end balances 
the following assumptions were used in the modeling activity earning asset growth of based on ending balances loan growth of based on ending balances investment and funds sold growth of based on ending balances deposit growth of based on ending balances balance sheet target balances were the same for all rate scenarios the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates as measured against a flat rate no change scenario 
table eight interest rate risk simulation of net interest income as of december  estimated impact on net interest income in thousands variation from flat rate scenario the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions  which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk 
the company also uses a second simulation scenario that rate shocks the balance sheet with an immediate parallel shift in interest rates of basis points 
this scenario provides estimates of the future market value of equity mve and net interest income nii 
mve measures the impact on equity due to the changes in the market values of assets and liabilities as a result of a change in interest rates 
the bank measures the volatility of these benchmarks using a twelve month time horizon 
using the december  balance sheet as the base for the simulation  the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates table nine interest rate risk simulation of nii as of december  change change in nii in nii from current from current mo 
horizon month horizon in thousands bp  bp  these results indicate that the balance sheet is asset sensitive since earnings increase when interest rates rise 
the magnitude of the nii change is within the company s policy guidelines 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
gap analysis provides another measure of interest rate risk 
the company does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
it is presented here for comparative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as reflected in table ten  at december   the cumulative gap through the one year time horizon indicates a liability sensitive position 
somewhere between one and five years the bank moves into an asset sensitive position 
this interest rate sensitivity table categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing immediately 
however  as has been observed through interest rate cycles  the deposit liabilities do not reprice immediately 
consequently  the bank s net interest income varies as though the bank is asset sensitive  ie as interest rates rise net interest income increases and vice versa 
this phenomenon is validated by the modeling as presented in tables eight and nine 
table ten interest rate sensitivity december  assets and liabilities over three which mature or reprice next day months and over one and within within and within over in thousands immediately three months one year five years five years total interest earning assets investments      loans  excluding nonaccrual loans and overdrafts       total       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand   savings   time certificates     other borrowings    total       interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      december  interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     liquidity liquidity management refers to the company s ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients 
both assets and liabilities contribute to the company s liquidity position 
federal funds lines  short term investments and securities  and loan repayments contribute to liquidity  along with deposit increases  while loan funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity 
the bank assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at december   were approximately  and  respectively 
such loans relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans  and to real estate construction loans 
the company s sources of liquidity consist of overnight funds sold to correspondent banks  unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total consolidated assets on december  in addition to liquid assets  the bank maintains short term lines of credit with correspondent banks 
at december   the bank had  available under these credit lines 
additionally  the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank 
at december   the bank could have arranged for up to  in secured borrowings from the fhlb 
informal agreements are also in place with various other banks to purchase participations in loans  if necessary 
the company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and  as such  its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
liquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas the bank reclassified all securities into the available for sale category 
this enables the bank to sell any of its unpledged securities to meet liquidity needs 
due to the rising interest rate environment throughout most of and the first half of  much of the investment portfolio experienced price declines  which resulted in unrealized losses 
these unrealized losses limited the bank s ability to sell these securities without realizing those losses 
because of the rapid decrease in interest rates at the end of and continuing into january  the unrealized loss in the investment portfolio has greatly diminished 
further declines in the market rates of interest could result in net unrealized gains in the portfolio 
these securities are available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise 
the bank has established a master repurchase agreement with a correspondent bank to enable such transactions 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more is set forth in table eleven 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available

these cash requirements are funded through direct reimbursement billings to the bank 
for non banking functions  the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends by the bank to service its commitments 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by the bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
off balance sheet items the bank has certain ongoing commitments under operating leases 
see note of the financial statements for the terms 
these commitments do not significantly impact operating results 
as of december   commitments to extend credit were the only financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
the bank has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options etc 
loan and letter of credit commitments increased to  from  at december  the commitments represent of total loans at year end versus a year ago 
disclosure of fair value the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards number  disclosures about fair value of financial statements  requires the disclosure of fair value of most financial instruments  whether recognized or not recognized in the financial statements 
the intent of presenting the fair values of financial instruments is to depict the market s assessment of the present value of net future cash flows discounted to reflect both current interest rates and the market s assessment of the risk that the cash flows will not occur 
in determining fair values  the company used the carrying amount for cash  short term investments  accrued interest receivable  short term borrowings and accrued interest payable as all of these instruments are short term in nature 
securities are reflected at quoted market values 
loans and deposits have a long term time horizon which required more complex calculations for fair value determination 
loans are grouped into homogeneous categories and broken down between fixed and variable rate instruments 
loans with a variable rate  which reprice immediately  are valued at carrying value 
the fair value of fixed rate instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates 
credit risk and repricing risk factors are included in the current rates 
fair value for nonaccrual loans is reported at carrying value and is included in the net loan total 
since the allowance for loan losses exceeds any potential adjustment for nonaccrual valuation  no further valuation adjustment has been made 
demand deposits  savings and certain money market accounts are short term in nature so the carrying value equals the fair value 
for deposits that extend over a period in excess of four months  the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash payments using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities 
at year end and year end  the fair values calculated on the bank s assets were below the carrying values 
accounting pronouncements the financial standards accounting board released for comment on february   a revised proposal for the elimination of pooling of interests accounting 
the fasb indicated that it will accept comments through march  as proposed  it is currently anticipated that the fasb will issue a final statement in june  which would likely require  among other matters  that all mergers initiated after the issuance of the final statement be accounted for as purchase transactions 
as proposed  a merger or business combination would be considered initiated if the major terms of the transaction  including the exchange or conversion ratio  are publicly announced or otherwise disclosed to shareholders of the combining companies 
the revised proposal contemplates that goodwill will not be amortized to earnings as originally proposed 
instead  goodwill would be recognized as an asset in the financial statements  measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and then tested for impairment to assess losses and expensed against earnings only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  based on standards to be specified in the final statement 
the effect of the proposal upon bank mergers is uncertain  however  the goodwill in a purchase accounting transaction may not be included in the calculation of regulatory capital requirements and some investment bankers have expressed the view that the elimination of pooling of interests accounting will result in lower merger premiums for sellers with the possibility of fewer transactions occurring after the effective date of the final statement 
for additional discussion of accounting pronouncements  see note in the consolidated financial statements at item other matters the state of california is presently experiencing serious periodic electric power shortages 
it is uncertain whether or when these shortages will be discontinued 
the company and the bank could be materially and adversely affected either directly or indirectly by a severe electric power shortage if such a shortage caused any of its critical data processing or computer systems and related equipment to fail  or if the local infrastructure systems such as telephone systems should fail  or the company s and the bank s significant vendors  suppliers  service providers  customers  borrowers  or depositors are adversely impacted by their internal systems or those of their respective customers or suppliers 
material increases in the expenses related to electric power consumption and the related increase in operating expense could also have an adverse effect on the company s and the bank s future results of operations
