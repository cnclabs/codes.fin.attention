products and services marketed by each of our business segments are described below 
global data repositories and processors in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from our global data repositories and processors products and services 
most of these products and services generate revenues based on usage 
the principal products and services offered through our global data repositories and processors segment include o credit scoring services and insurance bureau scores distributed through major credit bureaus  including our fico scores sold through the three major credit bureaus in the united states transunion llc  experian information solutions  inc and equifax inc  o our credit account management services which are distributed through third party bankcard processors worldwide  o our scorenet r services sold directly to credit grantors  o our prescore r services sold by us and delivered through credit bureaus  and o the score power tm service  offered jointly with equifax  providing online delivery of fico scores directly to consumers  along with equifax credit reports and explanatory information to help consumers manage their credit 
credit scoring services and insurance bureau scores 
our fico scores include general risk scores  industry specific risk scores  bankruptcy scores  revenue scores  and attrition scores 
credit grantors using these services pay the credit bureau based on usage  and the credit bureau shares these usage revenues with us 
we provide scoring models to each of the three major credit bureaus in the united states transunion  experian and equifax for calculating our proprietary fico scores 
fico scores are widely used by north american lenders managing credit cards  installment loans  mortgage loans and other products 
customers of the credit bureaus use the fico scores derived from these models to prescreen solicitation candidates  to evaluate applicants for new credit and to review existing accounts 
in fiscal we introduced our new us credit bureau product  nextgen credit bureau risk scores  at experian  making them available at all three major credit bureaus 
the nextgen risk scores are risk assessment tools designed to rank order consumer applicants  prospects and customers according to the likelihood of future default on credit obligations 
nextgen risk scores provide a more refined risk assessment making them an alternative to the classic fico risk scores 
by using the nextgen risk scores  credit grantors in many industries are able to more accurately and confidently design strategies for prospects  applicants  and customers across the entire risk spectrum 
we have also developed scoring systems for insurance underwriters and marketers 
such systems use the same underlying statistical technology as our fico risk scores but are designed to predict claim frequency or applicant profitability for automobile or homeowners coverage 
our insurance scores are available through transunion  experian  equifax and choicepoint  inc account management services at credit card processors 
we also provide account management products and services through first data resources  inc fdr and total system services  inc tsys  the two largest third party credit card processors in the united states

international our operations outside the united states are conducted primarily through our subsidiaries  distributors and through distribution channel partners  and are organized under the same business segments  global data repositories and processors  global financial services and other  described above 
we have offices throughout the world to deliver products and services that cover our core competencies in analytics  software and consulting 
our foreign offices are primarily sales and customer service offices acting as agents on behalf of the u 
s 
production operations 
the information set forth under the caption segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference 
net identifiable assets  capital expenditures and depreciation associated with foreign offices are not material 
revenues derived from clients outside the united states were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and  the canadian and european markets collectively generated over half of our international revenues 
currently the principal products marketed internationally are custom analytics  triad  strategyware and scoring models for account origination and account management 
as noted above  we establish and maintain alliance relationships through which our products  chiefly scores and account management services are sold 
these include third party credit card processors and credit bureaus 
markets and customers we serve clients in multiple industries  including financial services  insurance  retail  telecommunications and pharmaceuticals 
we have more than  end users of our products who purchase directly from us 
these include about of the largest banks in the united states  several of the largest banks in canada  approximately banks in the united kingdom  over insurers  more than retailers  seven oil companies  major travel and entertainment card companies  and more than finance companies 
the scoring  application processing and account management services offered through credit bureaus and third party processors extend usage of our technology to smaller credit issuers 
we market our services to a wide variety of businesses engaged in direct marketing 
these include banks  insurance companies and retailers  among others 
most of our global financial services product revenues come from direct sales to the end user of our services  but in some cases we act as a subcontractor to others managing a particular project for the end user 
we market our consumer services to an estimated million us consumers whose credit relationships are reported to the three major credit bureaus 
in fiscal  transunion accounted for approximately of our revenues  equifax  approximately  and experian  approximately 
in fiscal  transunion  equifax  and experian accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
the united kingdom and canada are our largest market segments outside the united states 
mexico  south africa  a number of countries in south america and almost all of the western european countries are represented in our user base 
we have delivered products to users in approximately countries 
we are actively pursuing new users and markets for our products 
we enjoy good relations with the majority of our clients and a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from repeat clients 
competition our competitors include scoring model builders  providers of credit reports and credit scores  providers of automated application processing services  data vendors  neural network developers and artificial intelligence system builders 
in house analytic and systems developers are also a significant source of competition for our products and services 
we believe that none of our competitors offer the same mix of products as we do  or have the same expertise in predictive analytics 
however certain competitors may have larger shares of particular geographic or product markets 
we compete with both outside suppliers and in house computer systems departments for scoring business 
major competitors among outside suppliers of scoring models include the three major credit bureaus 
in the consumer market we compete with companies that provide consumers with their credit reports  credit scores other than fico scores  and related monitoring and score analysis services 
homestore 
com  inc offers such services through several consumer web sites it maintains  including iplace 
com  consumerinfo 
com  and qspace 
com 
experian and transunion offer similar services through their web sites 
in addition to offering similar services  truelink  inc provides a consolidated credit report representing information from all three national credit reporting agencies 
only fair  isaac and equifax offer consumers access to their fico scores and associated services 
fico scores are used by the overwhelming majority of financial institutions to make the credit decisions that impact consumers and we believe that this provides us an advantage over our competition in this market 
both american management systems  incorporated ams and experian offer products intended to perform some of the same functions as our triad  strategyware and liquidcredit products and services 
we believe that our customers using these systems  in both custom end user form and through third party processors  significantly outnumber users of the competing ams and experian products 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in the market for liquidcredit are the same as those affecting scoring models  together with experience in developing computer software products 
competitors in this area include outside computer service providers and in house computer systems departments 
there are regional risk management  marketing  systems integration  and data warehousing competitors that have recently emerged for consulting services comparable to ours  but we believe that few offer the comprehensive business and technical expertise found within our consulting offerings 
several companies provide data processing and database management services in competition with our marketsmart products  some of which are larger than us 
we believe the market for such services will continue to expand rapidly for the foreseeable future 
competition in this area is based on price  service  and  in some cases  the ability of the processor to perform specialized tasks 
principal competitors in this area are acxiom corporation and harte hanks inc product protection and trademarks we have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual non disclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability in our client agreements to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product methodology and know how 
we retain title to  and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models  as a trade secret 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
in addition  we are seeking to protect certain of our technologies through the filing of patent applications due to favorable developments in the past few years in the case law and patent and trademark office guidelines for patentability of software  models and methods of doing business 
we do not otherwise have patent protection for our proprietary software 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important  but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge  ability  experience and creative skills of our personnel  new products  frequent product enhancements  and name recognition 
we have used  registered and or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks for our technologies  products and services 
research and development at present we are concentrating our efforts on both new versions and next generations of our decision engines  data management and analytics  and cutting edge work on strategy science optimization 
in addition  we have ongoing projects for improving our fundamental knowledge in the areas of both predictive and decision technology 
we will continue to invest in research and product development that is market oriented and supports our focus areas 
we believe that timely development of new products and enhancements to our existing products is essential to maintain our leadership position in our market and to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients 
we anticipate that certain new products and services will be developed internally but we have and may  based on timing and cost considerations  acquire or license technology or software from third parties when appropriate

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations revenues our reportable business segments consist of three segments on a worldwide basis global data repositories and processors  global financial services and other 
comparative segment revenues  operating income  and related financial information in fiscal  and are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table displays a the percentage of revenues by segment and b the percentage change in revenues from the prior fiscal year for the fiscal periods indicated 
prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year financial presentation for comparability 
percentage of period to period revenues percentage years ended change september  to to global data repositories and processors global financial services other total revenues the growth in revenues from the global data repositories and processors segment in fiscal was primarily due to a strong demand for risk scoring services at the credit bureaus 
this growth was fueled in part by increased marketing efforts of credit card issuers  a strong market for mortgage re financings and revenues from the score power service 
increased revenues from services provided through bankcard processors and from our insurance bureau scores at the credit bureaus also contributed to the growth of revenues in this segment in fiscal compared to fiscal similarly  in fiscal the revenues of the global data repositories segment increased primarily due to a strong demand for risk scoring services at the credit bureaus  increased revenues from services provided through bankcard processors and from our insurance bureau scores at the credit bureaus 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues derived from the scorenet service in fiscal revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for most of our revenue growth in the last three years 
revenues from services produced through credit bureaus increased in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  and accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  primarily due to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
while we have been successful in extending or renewing our agreements with credit bureaus and credit card processors in the past  and believe we will likely be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a material adverse effect on revenues and operating margin 
in fiscal  revenues generated from our alliances with transunion  equifax  and experian accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  transunion accounted for approximately of our revenues  equifax  approximately  and experian  approximately 
transunion  equifax  and experian accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively  in fiscal revenues derived from the global financial services segment in fiscal were essentially unchanged compared to fiscal global financial services revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due principally to increased sales of strategyware products and sales of fair  isaac marketsmart  clickpremium and fair  isaac decision system products 
the increase of in the other segment revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected growth in sales of all product categories in this segment 
revenues from the liquidcredit products grew strongly in  increasing  and were the largest contributor to the overall increase in revenues in this segment 
in addition  revenues from analytics products increased  retail increased and telecommunication products increased  compared to fiscal the decrease in other segment revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of bank consolidations and external marketing forces related to the year issue 
cutting across all reportable segments  revenues derived from clients outside the united states were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal increases in international revenues in fiscal reflected growth in sales of products from the other segment  primarily retail and telecommunications products 
in fiscal  increases were due primarily to increased sales of software products  including triad  increased usage of credit bureau scores and the number of accounts using our account management services at credit card processors in europe 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not had a significant effect on revenues to date 
in october we initiated a hedging program to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency translation rates resulting from holding net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
revenues from consulting services were of revenues in fiscal and less than of revenues in each of fiscal and revenues from software maintenance accounted for less than of revenues in each of the three years ended september  we do not expect revenues from software maintenance to exceed of revenues in the foreseeable future 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenues percentage change years ended september  to to revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues research and development sales  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge total costs and expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel directly involved in creating  installing and supporting revenue products  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and our payments made to credit bureaus for scores and for related outside support in connection with the scorenet service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  increased in each of fiscal and over the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to greater operating costs incurred for telecommunications services  planning and compliance functions and software and consulting services related to the north american market 
in fiscal  the increase was principally due to costs related to the discontinued healthcare receivables management system hrms line of business  increased revenues coming from global financial services products and services  all of which generally have a lower gross margin than our other products and services  and an increase in personnel costs because of a change in policy for accrued vacation and sick leave 
research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in development  researching mathematical and statistical models and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity  profitability and management control 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior period  due primarily to the redeployment of research and development personnel to support roles for our new products  such as strategy science line including credit line strategy optimization 
the decrease in research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal was due principally to the redeployment of personnel to focus on increasing netsourced delivery capacity for new software application products 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee salaries and benefits  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  business development expenses  and the cost of operating the computer systems 
as a percentage of revenues  sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were lower in fiscal  due primarily to reductions in personnel costs  consulting costs  and travel expenses as a result of our cost containment efforts 
sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of revenues  was lower in fiscal  due primarily to non recurring consulting fees related to our reorganization incurred in fiscal we are amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from four to fifteen years 
also see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in october  the company announced the discontinuance of its healthcare receivables management system product line  and as a result of exiting this business  recorded a restructuring charge totaling  for the year ended september  the company further recorded a restructuring charge totaling  related to a reduction in staff during fiscal year the company s restructuring actions were completed under the plan by june   and the combined restructuring charges for fiscal year totaled  of which  was related to write down of operating assets

during fiscal year  the company made cash payments of  and wrote off operating assets of  leaving no outstanding provision at september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other income  net other income  net consists mainly of interest income from investments  interest expense  exchange rate gains losses from holding foreign currencies in bank accounts  and other non operating items 
at september   we had approximately  invested in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income is derived from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements 
interest income increased in both fiscal and due to higher average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and instruments 
in fiscal  interest income was partially offset by our share of operating losses in an early stage development company accounted for using the equity method  interest expense and foreign currency losses 
in fiscal  the company entered into a lease arrangement to construct an office complex located at second and lindaro streets in downtown san rafael to accommodate future growth 
during fiscal  the company decided not to build out the site as planned following a five month study of its options 
under an agreement with the san rafael city government  the company was released from its obligation to occupy buildings on the site  and a real estate development firm agreed to continue with the development of the site 
as a result of the transaction concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a loss of approximately million in other income in fiscal in fiscal  we realized a one time gain of million due to the curtailment of our pension plan  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and realized a gain of  from the sale of marketable securities 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to revision of state tax rates to reflect increased activities in states with lower tax rates 
the increase to in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increased goodwill amortization in fiscal resulting from the earnout paid to former stockholders of credit risk management associates  a consulting company acquired in capital resources and liquidity working capital at september   september  and september  was   and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital in fiscal was due primarily to decreases in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  the total of which was more than offset by increases in accounts receivable  unbilled work in progress  and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in cash and cash equivalents  a higher proportion of investments in short term investments  a lower accrual for compensation and employee benefits expenses  and increases in accounts receivable and billings in excess of earned revenues 
our exposure to collection risks is comprised of the sum of accounts receivable plus unbilled work in progress  less billings in excess of earned revenues 
changes in contract terms and product offerings  along with variations in timing  may cause fluctuations in any or all of these items 
accounts receivable at september  were higher than at september   primarily due to the resolution of usage fees on a large client account in the last quarter of fiscal  unbilled work in progress increased by  primarily due to the increase in revenues from global data repositories and processors  and the total of billings in excess of earned revenue had only minimal change 
comparing fiscal with  increases in accounts receivable by and increases in billings in excess of earned revenues by were proportional  with minimal change in unbilled work in progress 
our primary method for funding operations and growth has been cash flows generated from operations and occasional lease financing 
net operating cash flows in fiscal increased by  compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in net income and non cash adjustments  partially offset by net working capital changes 
net operating cash flows in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in net income  non cash adjustment for deferred income tax  and net working capital changes  partially offset by an increase in non cash adjustments for depreciation 
the  increase of net cash used in investing activities during fiscal primarily reflected increased purchases of marketable securities and a moderate increase in purchase of property and equipment 
the  increase in investment activities spending during fiscal compared to was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment 
we expect to continue to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
our financing activities include principal payments for capital lease obligations  proceeds from stock option exercises  share repurchases under the board authorized program described below and dividend payments 
the  increase of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was due primarily to increased proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of treasury stock totaling  partially offset by higher stock repurchases totaling  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to proceeds of  received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of treasury stock partially offset by principal payments for capital lease obligations and cash dividends 
the negative cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were due primarily to stock repurchases and dividends paid  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of treasury stock 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   we had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   the company effected a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend  with cash payments in lieu of fractional shares 
the cash payments in lieu of fractional shares totaled  all share amounts have been restated to reflect the retroactive effect of the stock split 
in fiscal  we initiated a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  to be funded by cash on hand 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of million 
since the program was initiated  we have purchased a total of  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares under the program 
in the normal course of business we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and global locations 
we also evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs for both the current fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
european economic and monetary union emu under the european union s plan for economic and monetary union emu  the euro becomes the sole accounting currency of emu countries on january  the euro initially went into effect on january   and is now in participating countries austria  belgium  finland  france  greece  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain 
in this initial phase the emu mandated that key financial systems be able to triangulate conversion rates so that any amount booked will be logged and processed simultaneously in both the local currency and euros 
we believe that our computer systems and programs are euro compliant 
our costs associated with compliance were not material and were expensed as they were incurred 
we also believe the conversion to the euro will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
risk factors our revenues are dependent  to a great extent  upon general economic conditions and more particularly  upon conditions in the consumer credit and the financial services industries 
the majority of our revenues are derived from sales to the consumer credit industry 
in addition  during fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from products in our global financial services segment 
a downturn in the consumer credit industry or the financial services industry caused by increases in interest rates or a tightening of credit  among other factors  could harm our results of operations 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our existing and new products 
a softening of demand for our decisioning solutions caused by a weakening of the economy generally may result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively promote future revenue growth in our business 
since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of our largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard related scoring and account management business by cross selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers 
as this industry continues to consolidate  we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth 
for example  consolidation in the financial services industry could change the demand for our products and services that support our clients customer acquisitions programs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively promote future revenue growth in our business 
in addition  recent terrorist attacks upon the us have added or exacerbated economic  political and other uncertainties  which could adversely affect the company s revenue growth 
quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and this unpredictability will likely continue in the future 
our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past 
we expect fluctuations in our operating results to continue for the foreseeable future 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future period our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  and in this event the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
in addition  with the exception of the cost of scorenet service data purchased by us  most of our operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may have a significant impact on operating results 
factors that affect our revenues and operating results include the following o variability in demand from our existing customers  particularly within our global data repositories and processor segment  o the lengthy sales cycle of many of our products  o consumer dissatisfaction with  or problems caused by  the performance of our personal credit management products  o our ability to successfully and timely develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements  o the timing of our new product announcements and introductions in comparison with our competitors  o the level of our operating expenses  o changes in competitive conditions in the consumer credit and financial services industries  o fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions  o acquisition related expenses and charges  o timing of orders for and deliveries of certain software systems  and o other factors unique to our product lines 
our ability to increase our revenues is highly dependent upon the introduction of new products and services and if our products and services are not accepted by the marketplace  our business may be harmed 
we have a significant share of the available market for our traditional products and services  such as the products and services included in our global data repositories and processors segment 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending  retail  telecommunications and our newest market  personal credit management 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services  our revenues will be harmed 
there are significant risks associated with the introduction of new products 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product  especially in the area of customer relationship management  may affect market acceptance of our products and could harm our business  results of operations or financial position 
if we were to experience delays in the commercialization and introduction of new or enhanced products  if customers were to experience significant problems with the implementation and installation of products  or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  our business  results of operations or financial position could be harmed 
there can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance or will generate significant revenue 
products that we plan to directly or indirectly market in the future are in various stages of development 
we are expanding our technology into a number of new business areas to foster long term growth  including consumer services and the design of business strategies using our new strategy science technology 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel 
there is no assurance that we will compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these new areas 
failure to obtain data from our clients to update and re develop or to create new models could harm our business 
updates of models and development of new and enhanced models depend to a significant extent on availability of statistically relevant data 
such data is usually obtained under agreements with our clients 
refusals by clients to provide such data or to obtain permission of their customers to provide such data  and privacy and data protection restrictions  could result in loss of access to required data 
any interruption of our supply of data could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business and the business of our clients are subject to government regulation and changes in regulation 
legislation and governmental regulation inform how our business is conducted 
both our core businesses and our newer consumer initiatives are affected by regulation 
in both arenas  significant regulatory areas include federal and state regulation of consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies  like the fair credit reporting act the fcra  regulation designed to insure that lending practices are fair and non discriminatory  like the equal credit opportunity act  and privacy law  like provisions of the financial services modernization act of a variety of other consumer protection laws affect our business such as federal and state statutes governing the use of the internet and telemarketing 
in addition  many foreign jurisdictions relevant to our business have regulation in one or more of these general areas 
for example  in the european union eu the privacy directive directive ec creates minimum standards for the protection of personal data 
in addition  some eu member states have enacted protections  which go beyond the requirements of the privacy directive 
in connection with our core business to business activities  these statutes govern our operations directly to some degree 
for example  the financial services modernization act s restrictions on the use and transmittal of nonpublic personal information govern some of our activities 
however  governmental regulation has a significant indirect effect on such activities because such regulation influences our clients expectations and needs vis a vis our products and services 
our current and prospective clients activities are closely governed by the regulations outlined above and by other regulations 
for example  our clients include credit bureaus  credit card processors  state and federally chartered banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  and other consumer lenders and insurers  all of which are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulations  and often international regulations 
the products and services we sell to such clients must be appropriately designed to function in these regulated industries 
moreover  industries we may target in the future may also be subject to extensive regulations 
in connection with our score power service  many of the same regulations are pertinent 
in this arena  however  our activities are more directly affected by regulation 
for example  the fair credit reporting act governs when and how we may deliver the score power service to consumers 
the financial services modernization act of requires us to make certain disclosure to consumers regarding our collection and use of personal information and grants consumers certain opt out rights 
this type of regulation creates risk associated with compliance  such as possible regulatory enforcement action 
changes to existing regulation or legislation  or new regulation or legislation  or more restrictive interpretation of existing regulation by enforcement agencies  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
examples of possible regulatory developments that could affect our business include restrictions on the sharing of information by affiliated entities  narrowing of the permitted uses of consumer report data  and mandates to provide credit scores to consumers 
the permitted uses of consumer report data in connection with certain customer acquisition efforts are governed primarily by the fcra 
the relevant federal preemption provisions effectively sunset in unless extended  the sunset of preemption could lead to greater state regulation  increasing the cost of customer acquisition activity 
such state legislation could cause financial institutions to pursue new strategies  negatively affecting the demand for our existing offerings 
our operations outside the united states subject us to unique risks that may harm our results of operations 
a growing portion of our revenues is derived from international sales 
during fiscal and  we received approximately of our revenues from business outside the united states 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o the general economic and political conditions in countries where we sell our products and services  o incongruent tax structures  o difficulty in staffing and managing our organization s operations in various countries  o the effects of a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o import and export licensing requirements  o longer payment cycles  o currency fluctuations and changes in tariffs and other trade barriers  and o difficulties and delays in translating products and related documentation into foreign languages 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term 
some of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are not currently material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency translation losses were  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to increased foreign currency translation risks in the future 
if we do not recruit and retain qualified personnel  our business could be harmed 
our continued growth and success depend  to a significant extent  on the continued service of our senior management and other highly qualified key research  development  sales and marketing personnel and the hiring of new qualified personnel 
competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continually recruiting new personnel and in retaining existing personnel 
in general  we do not have long term employment or non competition agreements with our employees 
the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could harm our revenues and results of operations 
we rely upon our proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them  our business could be harmed 
because the protection of our proprietary technology is limited  our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that others  including our competitors  will not use our proprietary technology without our consent 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be subject to possible infringement claims that could harm our business 
with recent developments in the law that permit patenting of business methods  we expect that products in the industry segments in which we compete will increasingly be subject to claims of patent infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlaps 
similarly  we expect more software products will be subject to patent infringement claims in light of recent developments in the law that extend the ability to patent software 
regardless of the merits  responding to any such claim made against us could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms unfavorable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be harmed 
security is important to our business  and breaches of security  or the perception that e commerce is not secure could harm our business 
internet based  business to business electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
several of our products  including our new personal credit management product  are accessed through the internet 
consumers using the internet to access their personal information will demand the secure transmission of such data 
security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services  including our netsourced products and score power service  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect content and transactions on the networks on which the netsourced products and the proprietary information in our databases are accessed or on which the score power service is made available 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures or the security measures of our business partners could misappropriate proprietary  confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
further  a well publicized compromise of security could deter people and businesses from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
we are dependent upon major contracts with credit bureaus 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with the three major credit bureaus 
these contracts  which normally have a term of five years or less  accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
if we are unable to renew any of these contracts on the same or similar terms  our revenues and results of operations would be harmed 
we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 
as part of our business strategy  we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired company or assets are worth  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential product liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
these factors could harm our business  results of operations or financial position  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition 
consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  and rights to purchase stock or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share may result in connection with any such future acquisitions 
backlog orders may be cancelled or delayed 
there is no assurance that backlog will result in revenues 
we believe that increased revenue growth in fiscal and later years will depend to a significant extent on sales of newly developed products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than five years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we believe that our foreign currency and equity risks are not material
