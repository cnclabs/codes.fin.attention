item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item all share amounts and per share amounts in this discussion have been adjusted to give effect to a for stock split  paid as a stock dividend on april  introduction we derive our revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialized contracting services and offering comprehensive network solutions 
our customers include telecommunications  electric power and cable television companies  as well as commercial  industrial and governmental entities 
including all companies we acquired prior to december   we had pro forma combined revenues for the year ended december  of billion  of which was attributable to telecommunications customers  was attributable to electric power companies  was attributable to cable television operators and was attributable to ancillary services  such as installing intelligent traffic networks  cable and control systems for light rail lines  airports and highways  and providing specialty rock trenching  directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers 
we acquired companies in  of which have continued as separate operating and reporting subsidiaries  or platform companies  while the remaining acquired companies were tuck in acquisitions whose operating and accounting activities were absorbed into other operating subsidiaries 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids  the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we are generally able to achieve higher margins on fixed price and unit price contracts than on cost plus contracts as a result of our experience in bidding and performance 
our exposure to loss on fixed price contracts has historically been limited by the high volume and relatively short duration of the fixed price contracts we undertake 
however  as we perform larger projects  our reported margins may be significantly affected by actual results on these projects 
we complete most installation projects within one year  while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we generally recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under fixed price contracts 
we typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a to retainage from each progress payment and remits the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  wages and benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  insurance  facilities expenses  materials and parts and supplies 
our gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  is typically higher on projects where labor  rather than materials  constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services 
we can predict materials costs more accurately than labor costs 
therefore  to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs  we seek to maintain higher margins on labor intensive projects 
certain of our subsidiaries were previously subject to deductibles ranging from  to  for workers compensation insurance and  as of august   we have a deductible of  per occurrence related to workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims 
fluctuations in insurance accruals related to these deductibles could have an impact on gross margins in the period in which such adjustments are made 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  office rent and utilities  communications and professional fees 
through december   we have recognized goodwill of million  which primarily equals the excess amount we have paid for businesses over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of such businesses acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
we amortize this goodwill over its estimated useful life of years as a non cash charge to operating income 
we are unable to deduct the majority of amortized goodwill from our income for tax purposes 
seasonality  fluctuations of quarterly results our results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations 
during the winter months  demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements may be lower due to reduced construction activity 
however  demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the us typically  we experience lower gross and operating margins during the winter months 
the timing of acquisitions  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs and regional economic conditions may also materially affect quarterly results 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and long term debt of million  net of current maturities 
our long term debt balance at that date included borrowings of million under our credit facility  million of senior secured notes  million of convertible subordinated notes and million of other debt 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
during the year ended december   operating activities provided net cash to us of million  net of a non recurring special charge of million 
acquisitions created significant changes in our working capital accounts throughout the year and such accounts are not comparable to prior periods 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  including million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired 
financing activities provided net cash of million  resulting primarily from million from the private placement of senior secured notes and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes  partially offset by million in net repayments under our credit facility and million in repayments of other long term debt 
we currently have a million credit facility with participating banks 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries and the majority of our assets 
we use the credit facility to provide funds to be used for working capital  to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a libor plus to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility or b the bank s prime rate plus up to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
we pay commitment fees of to based on the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our subsidiaries guarantee repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility  and the credit facility restricts pledges of material assets 
we agreed to usual and customary covenants for a credit facility of this nature  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends on common stock  certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants and a requirement to obtain the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration 
as of march   we had a borrowing availability of million under the credit facility 
the weighted average borrowing rate on the credit facility for the year ended december  was 
in march  we closed a private placement of million principal amount of senior secured notes primarily with insurance companies 
in september  we issued an additional million principal amount of senior secured notes 
the resulting million of senior secured notes have maturities ranging from five to ten years with a weighted average interest rate of and  pursuant to an intercreditor agreement  rank equally in right of repayment with indebtedness under our credit facility 
the senior secured notes have financial covenants similar to those under the credit facility 
we used the proceeds from this private placement to reduce our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
in april  utilicorp purchased the million of convertible subordinated notes from enron capital and an affiliate 
utilicorp converted these notes into approximately million shares of quanta s common stock on june  on july   we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and  on august   we issued an additional million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility 
the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at per year and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to adjustment as a result of certain events 
the convertible subordinated notes require semi annual interest payments beginning december  until the notes mature on july  we have the option to redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes beginning july  at specified redemption prices  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if a fundamental change occurs  as described in the indenture under which we issued the convertible subordinated notes  holders of the convertible subordinated notes may require us to purchase all or part of their notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we entered into a management services agreement in september with utilicorp for advice and services including financing activities  corporate strategic planning  research on the restructuring of the electric power industry  the development  evaluation and marketing of our products  services and capabilities  identification of and evaluation of potential us acquisition candidates and other merger and acquisition advisory services  and other services that we may reasonably request 
the management services agreement required quanta to make quarterly payments to utilicorp of  through september  in december  we agreed to conclude our obligations under the management services agreement with utilicorp in exchange for a one time payment to utilicorp of approximately million 
during  we acquired companies for an aggregate consideration of million shares of common stock and million in cash 
the cash portion of such consideration was provided by proceeds from the sale of senior secured notes and borrowings under the credit facility 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next months 
however  if companies we wish to acquire are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we could be required to utilize more cash to complete acquisitions 
if sufficient funds were not available from operating cash flow or through borrowings under the credit facility  we may be required to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that we could secure such financing if and when we need it or on terms we would deem acceptable 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results
