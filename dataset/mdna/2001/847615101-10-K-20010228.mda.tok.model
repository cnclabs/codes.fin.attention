item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded as a solutions oriented company  designing and manufacturing products to suppress or eliminate electromagnetic interference emi 
in recent years  we broadened our focus and product lines to become a control products and systems company  providing a wide range of components and systems used to condition  regulate  transmit  receive  or govern electronic performance 
although our components and systems are used in many industries worldwide  our largest market is the telecommunications industry 
in  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our products are used in numerous telecommunications systems including wireless base stations  fiber optic networks and switching equipment  wireless modems and lans  internet servers  and global positioning systems 
our growth is being primarily driven by the expansion of the wireless and fiber optic networking segments of the telecommunications industry  the increasing electronic content and complexity of many end products and the positive impact of our strategic acquisitions 
our operations are primarily conducted in two business segments signal products and power products 
our signal products group manufactures a broad line of discrete emi filters  filtered arrays  filtered connectors  wireless products coaxial ceramic resonators  patch antennas  bandpass filters  and duplexers  and specialty ceramic capacitors single layer  temperature compensating  high voltage  and switch mode 
our power technologies group currently manufactures various power management and conditioning products including power distribution units  power line filters  and power entry modules 
recently  our power technologies group developed and introduced an advanced systems product offering to become a provider of more complex power management systems  including a line of digital radio frequency control equipment for remote and automatic electronic systems management 
on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division scpd of amp incorporated amp 
amp is a world leader in the manufacture of electrical  electronic  fiber optic and wireless interconnection devices and systems 
through scpd  amp manufactured and sold a broad line of emi filter products with annual sales of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  as a percentage of net sales  for the years ended november    and net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expense income from operations other income expense interest expense other income and expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to net sales consolidated net sales increased by million  or  from sales of signal products amounted to million in  an increase of million compared to of this increase  approximately million was generated from the sale of scpd products 
the remaining million increase in signal product sales principally reflects higher shipment levels for emi low pass filters  filtered arrays  and filtered connectors 
among other applications  these components are used in various telecommunication equipment including fiber optic networks  wireless base stations  power amplifiers  and transceivers 
sales of power products increased by  in  primarily reflecting additional shipments of power distribution units and single line filters 
these power products are principally used in telecommunications equipment  including high end internet servers and networks 
selling prices were relatively stable throughout overall demand for our products was strong throughout the year with total customer orders of million received in  an increase of million  or  from gross margin gross margin was million  or of sales in  compared to million  or of sales in in april  we commenced a program to integrate scpd into our signal products group 
this integration  which included relocating scpd manufacturing operations and redesigning certain scpd products and production processes  was completed in may with the completion of this integration  operating efficiencies and manufacturing yields improved during the second half of in june  we commenced manufacturing operations in our new  square foot facility in juarez  mexico 
production in this leased facility is expected to be phased in throughout fiscal in november  we completed the construction of a  square foot addition to our wesson  mississippi facility 
this facility will be utilized in the manufacturing of our power product offerings 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to increasing our manufacturing capacity  we believe these new facilities will improve our operating efficiencies and lower our overall production costs 
accordingly  we expect gross margins to approximate to of sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense with additional sales volume  selling expense increased during the period 
selling expense amounted to million  or of sales in  compared to million  or of sales in the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of sales principally reflects economies of scale realized with additional sales volume 
general and administrative expense was million in  compared to million in of the million increase  approximately  arises from the amortization of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of scpd and  arises from the write off of debt issuance costs upon the early payoff of certain indebtedness 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expense primarily reflects additional personnel costs and professional fees incurred to support business growth 
other income and expense interest expense increased by  during the period  from million in to million in of this increase   reflects greater short term bank borrowings and higher average interest rates in weighted average short term borrowings under our domestic line of credit were million in  compared to million in weighted average interest rates for borrowings under our domestic line of credit were approximately in and in the remaining increase of  principally reflects additional interest under the term loan incurred to substantially finance the acquisition of scpd 
as more fully discussed below  all borrowings under the term loan and our domestic line of credit were repaid in august we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
in  we realized  of license fee income upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
we incurred net gains of  in and  in on these foreign currency transactions 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets 
we have assessed our past earnings history and trends  and expiration dates of tax attribute carryforwards  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized to offset future taxable income from ordinary and recurring operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net sales consolidated net sales increased by million  or  from of this increase  million was generated from the sale of scpd and other signal products  with the remaining million primarily generated from the sale of power products 
these power products are principally used in telecommunications equipment  including wireless base stations  telephone switching networks  and internet servers 
overall market demand in the telecommunications industry was strong throughout the year 
in  we received total customer orders of million  an increase of from in addition to these customer orders  we assumed approximately million of customer order backlog in connection with the acquisition of scpd 
average selling prices declined slightly during the year as a result of market pressures 
gross margin gross margin was million  or of sales in  compared to million  or of sales in the decrease in gross margin percentage reflects several factors of relative equal significance  including additional production costs and inefficiencies incurred during the integration of scpd into our signal products group  changes in sales mix from our signal products to our power product offerings  yield losses and resultant higher labor costs incurred at our ceramic components division in new orleans  louisiana  and lower average selling prices as indicated above 
selling  general and administrative expense as a result of greater sales volume  selling expense increased during the period 
selling expense amounted to million  or of sales in  compared to million  or in the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of sales principally reflects economies of scale realized with the additional sales volume 
general and administrative expense was approximately million in  compared to million in of this increase  approximately  consisted of the amortization of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of scpd in march the remaining increase in general and administrative expense reflects additional personnel costs  professional fees and other operating expenses associated with our increased business activity 
other income and expense as a result of additional bank indebtedness  interest expense increased by million in  from  to million 
in march  we secured a million term loan to substantially finance the acquisition of scpd 
interest on the term loan was  in  with an average interest rate of approximately 
in addition  weighted average short term bank borrowings were million in  compared to  in in and  our wholly owned german subsidiary transacted business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than the deutsche mark 
as a result  we realized net gains of  in and incurred net losses of  in on these foreign currency transactions 
we recognized other income of  in and  in from certain short term investments and patent licensing fees 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
in  the effective tax rate also reflects the elimination of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously recorded for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
risk factors that may affect future results our results of operations may be affected in the future by a variety of factors including competitive pricing pressures  new product offerings by us and our competitors  new technologies  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  availability of raw materials  changes in product mix  and unexpected costs and delays in adding manufacturing capacity 
in  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our largest single customer  an original equipment manufacturer of telecommunication equipment  represented of our total consolidated net sales in any significant change in the activity level of this major customer  or the overall telecommunications industry  would have a direct impact on our performance 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition on august   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering which resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting issuance costs 
the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay million of revolving line of credit indebtedness and million of term loan debt  with the remaining proceeds added to cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes 
we maintain a million line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania 
this revolving credit line is unsecured  with interest rates on borrowings at or below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the current line of credit agreement expires april  our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains unsecured deutsche mark lines of credit with several german financial institutions aggregating million dm million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under these lines of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
with the proceeds from our public stock offering and the related retirement of debt  our working capital and current ratio improved significantly in at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  at november   current assets were times current liabilities  compared to at november  and at november  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our cash expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures in fiscal year primarily related to manufacturing equipment for our new mexican facility and other capacity expansion within our signal products group 
the capital expenditures principally related to metal fabrication machinery and other manufacturing equipment for capacity expansion in our power technologies group  domestic facility expansion within our signal products group  and construction of our new corporate administrative office facility in fairview  pennsylvania 
in order to meet expected customer demand and production requirements for our power product offerings  we have expanded our wesson  mississippi facility 
a  square foot addition to our existing facility was completed in november financing for this million project will be substantially provided by the state of mississippi through general obligation bonds in fiscal with the exception of this project  we had not entered into any material commitments for capital expenditures or debt financing at november  income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november    and amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for the next three fiscal years 
in september  we initiated a stock repurchase program 
under the program  we may repurchase up to million of our common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market  with the cost of the program financed out of available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on the ongoing assessment of our capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of our common stock 
in and  no shares were repurchased 
during   shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of  the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and  in we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal  as we continue to enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power products  and develop our new advanced systems product offerings 
we believe research and development expenses will approximate of sales in current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet cash requirements throughout fiscal these cash requirements include scheduled long term debt repayment  planned capital expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
with additional profitability and reduced working capital requirements  our operating cash flow increased significantly in for the year ended november   net cash generated from operations amounted to million  an increase of million from the comparable period of in  operating cash flow was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements 
net cash generated from operations amounted to million in  a decrease of million from during the year ended november   inventories increased by approximately million from operations 
the increase in inventories primarily reflects additional customer consigned inventory requirements  as well as additional raw material and work in process inventories to support increased production and shipment requirements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  we had strong operating cash flow 
during the year ended november   net cash generated from operations amounted to million and proceeds realized upon the exercise of employee stock options amounted to  this cash flow was used to fund capital additions of million  debt repayment of  stock repurchases of  and the aggregate purchase price of two acquired businesses 
in  we acquired substantially all of the assets of republic electronics corporation  a manufacturer of subminiature ceramic capacitors  and potter production corporation  a manufacturer of electronic filters and power products 
the total cash purchase price of the acquired assets amounted to million 
at november   goodwill represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
a majority of this goodwill was recognized in in connection with our acquisition of scpd 
we amortize goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of years and periodically review its carrying value for possible impairment 
based upon a review of expected future operating cash flows derived from the acquisition of scpd  we have determined that no impairment losses need be recognized in the accompanying financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in german deutsche marks  british pounds  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the deutsche mark  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we had forward currency exchange contracts to receive us dollars and pay german deutsche marks with aggregate notional amounts of  and average contractual exchange rates of 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 
in addition  an assumed adverse change in all foreign currencies in which we currently transact business would not have a material impact on our operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
euro certain member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
we have implemented all the necessary enhancements to our sales order  banking arrangements and operational procedures to ensure euro compliance 
we are able to process orders  invoice customers and accept payment in euros throughout europe 
the introduction of the euro has not had any material adverse impact upon us 
we continue to monitor the risk of price erosion which could result from increased price transparency among countries using the euro 
interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales increases reported in the accompanying financial statements  however  have substantially arisen from increased sales volume  not increases in selling prices 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 which clarifies the accounting rules for revenue recognition in financial statements 
we must implement sab no 
by the fourth quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
or sab no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
