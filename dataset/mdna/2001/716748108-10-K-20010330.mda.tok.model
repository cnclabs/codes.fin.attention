working capital before considering debt decreased from million in to million in this was caused primarily by significant capital expenditures related to offshore wells being drilled during the fourth quarter of on december   the company the guarantor and its subsidiaries petroquest  inc  a louisiana corporation petroquest la and petroquest energy one  llc petroquest one petroquest la and petroquest one collectively the borrower entered into a million revolving credit facility with hibernia national bank 
as a result of the reorganization of the company s subsidiaries in december  the credit agreement was amended on december  to reflect petroquest energy  llc as the borrower 
in the reorganization  petroquest one was the survivor of the merger between itself and petroquest la  and subsequently changed it name to petroquest energy  llc the borrowing base under this reducing revolving line of credit is based upon the valuation of the borrower s mortgaged properties  projected oil and gas prices  and any other factors deemed relevant by hibernia national bank 
the initial borrowing base  consisting of two separate facilities  is  and is scheduled for redetermination semi annually on september and march the borrowing base is also subject to quarterly reductions initially set at  effective march  the borrowing base availability for facility a is  the borrower can choose to borrow on the line of credit under facility a bearing interest at either the prime rate or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
facility a matures on december  the borrowing base availability for facility b is  and can only be utilized after facility a is exhausted 
the interest rate for facility b is the prime rate plus and matures on december  in addition  the credit facility allows the borrower to use up to  of the borrowing base for letters of credit for fees of per annum 
the credit facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties  a pledge of the membership interest of petroquest energy  llc and all of the membership interest owned now or in the future by the company in petroquest energy  llc in addition  the company agreed to guarantee the indebtedness of the borrower 
the credit facility contains covenants and restrictions common to borrowings of this type  as well as maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all of its covenants at december  at december   approximately  was outstanding under facility a and classified as long term debt 
the  is scheduled for payment during a  letter of credit  which expired february   was issued to secure credit exposure associated with certain hedging transactions 
also  a  letter of credit  which expires on december   was issued to secure several plug and abandonment bonds totaling  as required by the minerals management service related to ship shoal block the unused portion of facilities a and b at december  was on december   the company and the borrower also entered into a  subordinated bridge facility with encap energy capital fund iii  lp  which matures on september   subject to two extensions of thirty days each 
initially   was drawn on the bridge facility and a  commitment fee was paid to the lender 
if the remaining  is drawn on the bridge facility  an additional  in commitment fees will have to be paid 
the loan carries a fixed interest rate of  and is secured by a second mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties 
in addition  the company agreed to guarantee the indebtedness of the borrower 
the proceeds from the bridge facility were primarily used to purchase and develop the interests acquired in the ship shoal field 
the company intends to make payments through cash flow from operations  by drawing on the hibernia national bank facility  or by obtaining additional financing which could include the sale of property interests  additional equity and debt securities  and additional bank financing 
on april   the company entered into a loan agreement for non recourse financing to fund completion  flow line and facility costs of its high island block property 
the property is security for the loan 
interest is payable at and the lender receives a overriding royalty interest in the property 
for the first three production months  all of the net cash flow from the property was dedicated to payment of principal and interest on the loan 
subsequently  of the net cash flow from the property assuming production levels of mmcf day is dedicated to debt service 
the well began producing during july at december    remains outstanding under this loan 
net cash flow from operations before working capital changes increased from  in to  in operations in improved because of better product prices and increased production as the result of successful exploration activities 
on july   the company completed a private placement of million shares of common stock to accredited investors at a purchase price of per share for a total consideration of  before fees and expenses 
after fees and expenses  including  in commissions  proceeds to the company were  the proceeds were used to build and install production facilities  and for development drilling and completion activities 
the issuance of the common stock was exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended  and the company has registered the resale of the common stock with the securities and exchange commission on form s the company has budgeted for capital expenditures for and has an exploration and development program for the year which will require significant capital 
our budget for direct capital for new projects in is approximately  this represents twenty one projects exposing the company to bcfe of net unrisked reserve potential 
in order to fund its cash requirements for continued oil and gas exploration and development activities  the company plans to utilize available cash flow  obtain additional financing which could include the sale of property interests  additional equity and debt securities  and additional bank financing 
the sale of additional debt or equity securities could be dilutive to the company s present stockholders 
there is no assurance that such plans will be successful 
if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  it could be forced to delay or even abandon some of its exploration and development opportunities 
full cost ceiling write down the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool the pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the units of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved future production 
to the extent that costs capitalized in the pool net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves  and the lower of cost and fair value of unproved properties  excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or natural gas prices increase 
the company was required to write down its asset base in due primarily to the cost in excess of net book value recorded in the merger with american and significant declines in oil prices during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company s indebtedness under its line of credit is variable rate financing 
the company believes that its exposure to market risk relating to interest rate risk is not material 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed to market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk or equity price risk 
the company s revenues are derived from the sale of its crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the prices the company receives for its crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate  impact on the company s revenues 
in a typical hedge transaction  the company will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  the company is required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
the company is required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether the company has sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require the company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent the company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
as of december   the company had open collar contracts with third parties whereby minimum floor prices and maximum ceiling prices are contracted and applied to related contract volumes 
these agreements in effect for are for gas volume of  mmbtu per day beginning in january through december at a weighted average a ceiling price of and floor price of 
the company had no open oil hedging contracts at december  at january   the company recognized a liability of  related to these costless collars  the cumulative catch up adjustment is recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income 
to the extent of intrinsic value  these collars have been designated as cash flow hedges
