periods presented 
the results of operations for the years ended december   and combine the results of the fumi parking business and the fur parking business on a pro forma basis as if the march  transactions had been completed at the commencement of the earliest of the periods presented 
we have presented the information in this manner to assist the reader  as we believe it is the most meaningful way to consider and evaluate the company in its current form 
in doing this we are not indicating what the results of operations would actually have been if the businesses had been combined on those dates 
overview we operate parking facilities under three types of arrangements leases  management contracts  and fee ownership 
these three types are discussed further in this report under item business 
revenues consist of parking revenues from leased and owned facilities  and revenues earned in accordance with the terms of management contracts 
the following table sets out the pro forma revenues earned from each of the three operating arrangements for each of the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands leased facilities    managed facilities    owned facilities    total    the number of facilities operated as at each fiscal year end under each of these arrangements is as follows as at december  leased facilities managed facilities  owned facilities in we disposed of locations on the sale of two of our subsidiaries  robbins parking services ltd 
leased and managed locations  and imperial parking asia ltd 
leased and managed locations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues  on a pro forma basis  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to greater revenues from leased facilities as detailed below 
pro forma revenues from leased facilities for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily a result of commencing operations in san francisco in february  and specifically the opening of the pacific bell baseball stadium in april  which contributed million in lease revenue 
the acquisition in april of ten leased facilities upon the purchase of e z park and subsequent organic growth in cincinnati  also generated million of additional lease revenue in fiscal a further million of additional lease revenue was generated in fiscal from converting a significant urban mid west us parkade in december from a management contract to a lease 
these increases were offset by the sales in of the robbins parking and asian divisions which had generated million of lease revenue in pro forma revenues from management contracts for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase is attributed to organic growth and increased management fees on existing locations of million offset by the sales in of the robbins parking and asian operations which had generated million of management contract revenue in pro forma direct costs in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was attributable to higher rent expense from the start of operations in san francisco  the acquisition of e z park and the conversion of the urban mid west us parkade to a lease arrangement 
rent expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
rent as a percentage of revenues  excluding robbins and asia  increased from to for fiscal and  respectively 
offsetting this increase in direct costs was the effect of the sales in of the robbins and asian operations which incurred million of direct costs in fiscal an increase of million in other operating expenses related to the increase in lease revenue accounted for the remaining change in direct costs for fiscal over fiscal direct costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal pro forma general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal expenses in included an adjustment for an employee severance provision accrued in  but which was determined to be over accrued by million and reversed in also included additional severance of million and million related to the robbins and asian operations sold in excluding these three items  general and administrative expenses for were million 
the increase in over includes million related to growth in new cities cincinnati  san francisco  cleveland and new york and million of compensation expense for shares and options issued to directors and management in general and administrative expenses  excluding severance  as a percentage of pro forma total revenues decreased to for the fiscal compared to for fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  as a result of the full amortization of certain management and lease agreements which are amortized over the term of the agreements 
in fiscal  other income of million reflects interest earned on cash balances and other investments of million partially offset by corporate tax expense of million 
no interest income was recorded in the pro forma results 
the provision for deferred income taxes  including million for non deductible goodwill amortization  would have been million higher for fiscal  except for credit of million for the change in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset representing loss carry forwards in canada 
the company s loss carry forwards in canada are fully recognized in the financial statements at december  the valuation allowance at december  is million and largely represents the expectation that the losses will be utilized at rates lower than currently in effect 
we will provide for a deferred tax expense at statutory rates in based on pre tax income adjusted for non deductible goodwill amortization 
current taxes payable for will be limited to capital and state taxes 
pro forma net earnings for fiscal were million an increase of million from the million loss for fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased gross margin of million  lower other operating expenses of million  and higher other income of million offset by the reversal in of over accrued severance of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues  on a pro forma basis  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to greater revenues from leased facilities  as detailed below 
pro forma revenues from leased facilities increased million  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase was driven by new business growth  primarily in calgary  alberta  toronto  ontario  minneapolis  minnesota and milwaukee  wisconsin where major new leased facilities were added during the period 
also  the parking revenues have been reduced in versus by million as a result of the robbins parking and asian operations sold during the year 
pro forma revenues from management contracts decreased million  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from fumi cancelling the agreements for impark to manage its us properties in october also  the parking revenues have been reduced in versus by million as a result of the robbins parking and asian operations sold during the year 
pro forma direct costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was due principally to increased rents of million on the major new lease facilities added during the year 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increased payroll cost of million on the new facilities 
direct costs  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the large new lease deals in calgary  toronto  minneapolis and milwaukee 
a number of these locations were unprofitable or only marginally profitable in their first year 
new lease locations may require a few years to achieve their revenue and profit potential 
in order to maximize the financial performance of a new lease  we would make physical and operational changes that include but are not limited to  providing better lighting  developing new pricing and marketing policies  implementing new safety and security procedures  upgrading signage and parking equipment and redirecting traffic flow 
also  the direct costs have been reduced in versus by million as a result of the robbins parking and asian operations sold during the year 
pro forma general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an employee severance provision of million in this provision was ultimately determined to be over accrued by million which was reversed in this reversal was partially offset by a severance provision in of million 
the decrease was also partially attributable to million higher us expansion costs for fiscal also  general and administrative expenses have been reduced in versus by million as a result of the robbins parking and asian operations sold during the year 
general and administrative expenses  before taking into account severance  decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this was a result of management efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses and the effect of spreading general and administrative expenses over a greater revenue base 
depreciation and amortization decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was attributable to lower depreciation and amortization on management contracts and agreements in than in as they became fully amortized during this period 
on a pro forma basis there was no interest expense for fiscal as the bank and related party debt has been considered repaid 
for fiscal interest expense on a pro forma basis was million on debt owing to a former shareholder 
this debt was repaid in june other expenses in fiscal included a write down in the value of goodwill of million at the fiscal year end 
goodwill was primarily created on the push down of the acquisition of the business of impark holdings by fumi in april due to the losses incurred in the fumi parking business since its acquisition  at december  the management of fumi and of a predecessor to the company assessed the recoverability of the net book value of goodwill 
this review was made by comparing the net book value of the estimates of future cash flows from the fumi parking businesses 
as a results of this review  an impairment charge in goodwill of million was recorded 
net loss on a pro forma basis decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due to recording in the million goodwill write down combined with lower general and administrative expenses of million  lower interest costs of million  lower depreciation and amortization of million and reduced other expenses of million  offset by decreased gross margin of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash of million 
of this amount  million is restricted  including million in support of a lien bond that was issued during the third quarter while we negotiate final costs with the contractor of the san francisco giants development 
we estimate that up to approximately million will be required to complete funding of the development costs of the stadium parking based on a total estimated cost of million 
for fiscal  we used million of cash in operating activities 
this amount included uses of cash resulting from the following i million of prepaid parking revenue from the giants baseball season ticket holders that was part of the cash balances of the fumi parking business acquired in march and subsequently remitted to the landlords of the parking facilities over the course of the baseball season  ii million of cash which has been restricted  principally to support a lien bond issued in conjunction with the negotiation of final costs of the san francisco giants parking facility  and iii million deposited with canada customs and revenue agency on account of a previously provided liability from a legal dispute over the taxable nature of parking violation notice revenue in canada 
the dispute was settled in june we do not expect to make any further payments in settlement of the tax liability in excess of the million deposited 
excluding the impact of these three items  we generated million of cash from operations for fiscal we acquired million of cash at the time of the acquisition of the fumi parking business by way of million of cash in the fumi parking business and million of cash contributed  net of repayment of outstanding credit facilities  by first union 
in addition to funding the cash used in operating activities  the cash was used to repurchase  shares during the year at a cost of million 
we purchased a further  shares in january at a cost of million 
further uses of cash in fiscal included million of capital expenditure on fixed assets  million for the acquisition of ez park and million of development costs for the giants project 
in october  we finalized a new million credit facility with hsbc bank canada 
this facility will be used to support working capital  establish letters of credit and fund capital investment opportunities 
as at december   we had not drawn down on the credit facility 
we may need letters of credit for bids on larger lease or management contracts 
in the next months  we anticipate the working capital necessary to satisfy current obligations will be generated from operations  available cash and our new bank facility 
depending on the timing and magnitude of future investment opportunities  which could be in the form of leased or purchased properties  joint ventures and acquisitions  we anticipate the cash required to come from operations  the new bank facility  a rights offering or an equity offering 
in the future  if we identify investment opportunities requiring cash in excess of operating cash flows and credit facilities  we may seek additional sources of capital  including the sale or issuance of impark common stock or a rights offering  or amending our credit facility to obtain additional indebtedness 
no assurances can be given that such increases would be available at the time needed to complete any such transaction 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes consistent accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
as of december   we have not adopted this standard and do not expect to do so prior to its required application date 
as of december   we believe we have not entered into significant instruments that are subject to sfas  and that the initial adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total historical revenues from canadian operations amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian leased or owned facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited as the canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs 
we anticipate implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases 
impact of inflation and changing prices our primary sources of revenues are parking revenues from owned and leased locations and management contract revenue net of expense reimbursements 
in the years ended december  and inflation had a limited impact on our operations 
quarterly results we may experience fluctuations in our income from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in revenues and related expenses due to acquisitions  pre opening costs  travel and transportation patterns affected by weather and calendar related events  and local and national economic conditions 
additionally  we manage the parking for a number of sports stadiums and arenas and our income can be affected by the relative degree of success of various sports teams

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk to december   we have not entered into significant derivative instruments either for hedging or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had no such instruments outstanding 
we will periodically hold excess available cash in cash equivalents which are short term deposits at major financial institutions with terms to maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less 
interest rates our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on cash invested in short term deposits which are all included in cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated real rate of return 
however  due to the short term nature of such investments  the risk of loss to market is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total revenues from canadian operations amounted to million for the year ended december  as detailed in note to the financial statements 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian leased or owned facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited as the canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs 
we anticipate implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases
