the company is one of the leaders in semiconductor audio products for the pc marketplace 
ess pc audio products enable pc manufacturers to provide audio capabilities on add on sound cards and directly on the motherboards of desktop and notebook computers 
the company has established itself as a leader in integrated audio solutions and counts many of the leading manufacturers of pcs and sound cards among its customers 
the company has not experienced any material impact of inflation in the past 
there can be no assurance  however  that any future inflation would not have any adverse impact on its net sales  revenue and income from operations 
at the end of  the company purchased acres of land in fremont  california 
by the end of  the company completed and occupied a two story   square foot headquarters 
in  the company completed construction of a  square foot building to support headcount growth  which is now being occupied by the company s majority owned subsidiary vialta 
an  square foot dormitory was also completed during in october  the company sold acres of un used land in fremont  california 
during the fourth quarter of  the company established a wholly owned foreign subsidiary in the cayman islands  british west indies and transferred a substantial portion of its business operations to it 
in april  the company established a subsidiary  vialta  that plans to introduce advanced  user friendly products and applications for the internet 
vialta completed its equity financing generating a total of million 
ess contributed million cash in the vialta equity offering and acquired a ownership in vialta as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss nonoperating income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss before minority interest loss attributable to minority interest net income loss net revenues 
net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net revenues decreased between and primarily due to the softness in the pc marketplace and a decrease in asp in the audio markets 
in  the company s communication and video business grew while pc audio business declined  the company expects these trends to continue 
company s majority owned subsidiary vialta did not record any revenue in  since its products are still in the development stage 
net revenues increased between and primarily from increased video sales 
the company s video sales accounted for a majority and the company s pc audio sales accounted for a significant portion of the company s net revenue in the company s video sales and pc audio sales accounted for a significant portion of the company s net revenues in the company s pc audio products accounted for a majority of the company s net revenues in international revenues accounted for approximately   and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
the company s net revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the company expects that its percentage of international sales will remain high in the future 
for the first time  the company had a stronger third quarter than fourth quarter in the digital video products 
the shift resulted from many of the company s china oems the company s products are sold through company s distributors 
now building the majority of their products for export  and thus the worldwide christmas season demand has made the third quarter the company s largest revenue quarter as opposed to the later demand typical in china based on the chinese new year season during the fourth quarter 
the company expects this trend to continue as more of its products are exported out of china to worldwide customers 
gross margin 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing corresponding gross margins of  and of net revenues for such years 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to an increase of million in inventory reserves in during the quarters ended september  and december   the company purchased inventory based on the company s original sales forecast and the company s intent to build up inventory on key products from its foundries due to a forecasted tight wafer capacity 
however  during the quarter ended december   the overall market for pc audio products declined significantly  and  as a result  the demand for these products did not meet the company s forecasts 
on a pro forma basis  before recognition of the additional million inventory reserve  the gross margin would have been for compared to for on the pro forma basis  the increase in gross margin from to was primarily due to favorable product mix partially offset by reduced asps 
the increase in gross margin from to was the result of favorable product mix and reduced manufacturing cost partially offset by reduced asps 
the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including among others  competitive product pricing  unit volumes shipped  new product introductions  yields  wafer costs  assembly costs  and product mix as well as the company s ability to forecast demand accurately 
the company has encountered increased competition from other suppliers who are offering competitive products and new features 
in addition  the company expects the overall asps for its existing products to decline significantly over the life of the products 
the company believes that in order to maintain or increase gross margin  it must achieve higher unit volume shipments  reduce costs  add new features and introduce new products 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to ship higher volumes  reduce costs  add new features or introduce new products that will gain market acceptance 
research and development expenses 
on going research and development expenses were million  million and million or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
year operating expenses included an additional million for in process research and development due to the purchase of netridium 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to vialta s growth 
vialta incurred million of the above research and development expenses in  compared to million in vialta s increase was primarily due to increased headcount and expenses relating to the business completing a full year of operations and ramping up for product expected to be released in excluding its vialta subsidiary ess s research and development expenses decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in internal projects  consulting  and outside services 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased payroll related expenses  software maintenance and depreciation and amortization 
the company expects that research and development expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million or  and of net revenues  in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to vialta s growth 
vialta incurred million of the above selling  general and administrative expenses in  compared to million in vialta s increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased headcount and expenses relating to a full year of operation and ramping up for products expected to be released in ess  excluding its subsidiary vialta  decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by million in from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in legal and payroll related expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to increased marketing expenses and legal expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses relating to reserves for accounts receivable 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated selling  general and administrative expenses 
non operating income 
net non operating income was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in  non operating income consisted primarily of a pretax gain of million on the company s disposition of its preferred stock in komodo technology in exchange for shares of common stock of cisco systems in september  million net interest income on cash and short term investments  million gain from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
in and  non operating income consisted primarily of interest income 
in early  the company provided start up capital to komodo technology and in turn received a equity interest and a license of komodo s voice over internet protocol voip technology 
komodo was a leading developer of voip appliances that allow analog telephones to place low cost calls over ip based networks 
cisco systems acquired ess equity interest s in komodo technology in september in exchange for shares of common stock of cisco systems 
in conjunction with this transaction  the company recognized a million pretax gain  or a million net gain 
net interest income increased primarily due to higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investments in vialta which accounted for approximately million of net interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate excluding the provision taken on the gain from investment was for the company used an estimated tax rate on the gain from investment  which netted a million gain after tax 
the tax rate for of was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate of as a result of the lower foreign tax rate on earnings from the company s foreign subsidiary that was considered to be permanently reinvested 
the reported tax provision for of of pre tax income is below the combined federal and state statutory rate of as a result of the lower foreign tax rate on earnings from the company s foreign subsidiary that was considered to be permanently reinvested 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the reported tax benefit for of of pre tax losses is below the combined federal and state statutory rate of since a majority of the losses was incurred by a foreign subsidiary and was not deductible in the united states 
net income loss 
net income loss was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the results for include million of nonoperating income resulting primarily from the gain on investment and interest income  this gain was partially offset by an increase of operating expenses due to the development of vialta  and an increase of inventory reserves 
the increase of net income during compared to primarily due to significant increase in revenues and gross margin as a result of favorable product mix in liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated by operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and short term and long term debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  of which million belonged to vialta  and working capital of million  of which million belonged to vialta 
at december   the company had a million unsecured line of credit  which expires on october  the line of credit requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and operating results 
on december   the company was in compliance with its borrowing criteria 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit at december  in  the company used million cash in operating activities 
this amount resulted primarily from increase in the company s current assets of million  offset by the in flows from current year net income  increase in a notes payable to related party of million and income tax related liabilities of million 
the company generated million cash from investing activities  which mainly resulted from the company s net sales of short term investments  partially offset by acquisition of property  plant and equipment and netridium 
the company generated million cash from financing activities  which resulted primarily from cash received from vialta s minority investors of million  issuance of common stock under employee stock option plan  partially offset by repurchase of the company s common stock of million 
in  the company generated million cash from operating activities 
this amount resulted from current year net income of million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by increase in inventories of million and decrease in income tax related liabilities 
the company used million cash in investing activities  which resulted primarily from purchase of short term investment and property  plant and equipment 
the company generated million cash from financing activities  which is primarily from cash received from vialta s minority investors of million 
in  the company generated million cash from operating activities 
this is primarily due to the decrease in current assets of million  increase in current liabilities  offset by the current year operating loss of million 
the company generated million cash from investing activities as a result of cash from sale of joint venture investment 
the company used million cash in financing activities mainly due to the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  together with the cash generated from operations  available borrowings under its line of credit and other financing options  will be sufficient to fund acquisitions of property and equipment and provide adequate working capital through at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million of which million is to be used by ess and million is to be used by vialta primarily for the acquisition of capital equipment 
the company may also utilize cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of or investment in such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties

factors that may affect future results this report contains certain forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties 
for such statements  the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e of and rule b under the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding the company s expectations  intentions or future strategies and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the gain or loss of significant customers  increased competitive pressures  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  including decreases in asp of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products 
other factors include the availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the market for pcs  seasonal customer demand  the timing of significant orders and significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
also  a significant portion of the company s expenses is fixed in the short term  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s expectations  it may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales or earnings that may be attained by the company in any given period in the future 
the company currently places non cancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be canceled without significant penalty 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected or forecasted sales levels are not realized  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition and pricing pressures 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price declines and rapid product obsolescence 
see item business competition 
dependence on the pc and consumer markets 
in sales of video semiconductor chips to the vcd svcd and dvd player market accounted for a majority of the company s revenues 
the company expects that sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
sales of video semiconductor chips to the vcd  svcd and dvd player market accounted for a significant of the company s revenues in and a significant portion of its net revenues in in  sales of pc audio semiconductor chips accounted for a majority of the company s net revenues 
any reduction in asps or demand for the company s semiconductor chips  whether because of a reduction in demand for pcs  dvd or vcd players in general  increased competition or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently engaged in the development and introduction of new pc audio  video and modem semiconductor devices for the internet  pc and consumer markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s products are sold for incorporation into desktop and notebook computers and vcd  svcd and dvd players 
therefore  the company is heavily dependent on the growth of the markets and the cost requirements for desktop and notebook computers and vcd and dvd players 
there can be no assurance that these markets will be able to grow 
a slowing in unit volume and a decrease in asps could result in a decline in revenues  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business pc audio products  communication products vcd svcd products and dvd products 
some of the company s products are sold for incorporation into pcs 
the recent economic downturn has reduced pc demand 
additionally  as the pc industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet  an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional pcs may reduce the overall pc industry s demand for the company s existing products 
thus  the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another and by the overall demand for pcs 
importance of new products and technological changes 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including timely completion of product development  market acceptance of the company s and its customers new products  securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers  achievement of acceptable wafer fabrication yields by the company s independent foundries and the company s ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
in order to succeed in having the company s products incorporated into new products being designed by its customers and oems  the company must anticipate market trends and meet performance  quality and functionality requirements of such customers and oems and must successfully develop and manufacture products that adhere to these requirements 
in addition  the company must meet the timing and price requirements of such manufacturers and must make such products available in sufficient quantities 
accordingly  in selling to oems  the company can often incur significant expenditures prior to volume sales of new products  if any 
in order to help accomplish these goals  the company has in the past and will continue to consider in the future the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies 
such acquisitions carry additional risks  such as an ineffective integration with existing products and corporate culture  the potential for large write offs and the diversion of management attention 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify market trends or new product opportunities  develop and market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by others 
a failure in any of these areas would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business research and development 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the company products increase the risk that the company s customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have been shipped 
this could result in material recall and replacement costs for product warranty and support 
the recurrence of significant defects  delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance and diversion of the attention of the company engineering personnel from our product development efforts could also adversely impact the company s customer relationships 
new business venture 
in  the company incorporated vialta  originally as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to develop and market new products and applications for the internet 
as of december   the company had contributed a total of million in cash to vialta and acquired million shares of vialta s series a preferred stock  million shares of vialta s series b preferred stock and  shares of vialta s common stock 
as of december  million shares of vialta s series b preferred stock and million shares of vialta s common stock were issued to fred sl chan  the company s chairman of the board  and an entity controlled by fred sl chan and annie mh chan  a director of the company and spouse of mr 
chan for million and million  respectively 
in addition  vialta received a total of million from third party investors and certain employees in exchange for shares of vialta s series b preferred stock and common stock 
the company s investment in vialta involves all of the risks normally associated with investments in development stage companies 
in order for vialta to begin earning revenues and ultimately achieve profitability  it must successfully develop and market new products and applications on a cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that vialta will be able to do so  since  among other things  the company has limited experience in starting new business ventures and there is intense competition in the marketplace for internet products and applications generally 
in addition  the company s investment in vialta may adversely affect the company s existing business  financial position and results of operations by diverting management s attention  working capital and other resources from the company to vialta 
dependence on tsmc and other third parties 
the company relies on independent foundries to manufacture all of its products 
a substantial majority of the company s products are currently manufactured by tsmc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since the company also has foundry arrangements with umc  which has manufactured certain of the company s products since these relationships provide the company with access to advanced process technology necessary for the manufacture of the company s products 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and  in certain cases  manufacture products of their own design 
in december  the company secured wafer capacity that it believes will be adequate to meet its forecast for the next months 
in november  the company secured wafer capacity that met its year needs 
in september  taiwan experienced a series of earthquakes 
while the company did not experience any material effects from these earthquakes  there can be no assurance that any future earthquakes or any future natural disaster will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business manufacturing 
while the company has entered into agreements with these two foundries  the company s reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the international risks more fully described below 
in addition  the company has pre negotiated certain of its purchase orders and could be unable to benefit from enhanced yields realized by its vendors 
the company expects to rely upon tsmc and umc to manufacture substantially all of the company s products for the foreseeable future 
in the event that tsmc and umc are unable to continue to manufacture the company s key products in required volumes  the company will have to identify and secure additional foundry capacity 
in such an event  the company may be unable to identify or secure additional foundry capacity from another manufacturer 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process could take six months or longer 
the loss of any of its foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company to acquire additional capacity at its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity should additional capacity be necessary  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in the supply of semiconductors to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  ess will continue to consider and may be required to enter into additional arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
any such arrangements could require the company to commit substantial capital and grant licenses to its technology 
the need to commit substantial capital may require the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
the company obtains foundry capacity through forecasts that are generated in advance of expected delivery dates 
the company s ability to obtain the foundry capacity necessary to meet the future demand for its products is based on its ability to accurately forecast such future demand 
if the company fails to accurately forecast such future demand  the company may be unable to timely obtain an adequate supply of wafers necessary to manufacture the number of products required to satisfy the actual demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to accurately forecast the future demand for its products and obtain sufficient foundry capacity in the future 
ess has from time to time experienced disruptions in supply  although none of those disruptions have to date materially adversely affected results 
there can be no assurance that manufacturing or assembly problems will not occur in the future or that any such disruptions will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations 
further  there can be no assurance that suppliers who have committed to provide product will do so  or that the company will meet all conditions imposed by such suppliers 
failure to obtain an adequate supply of products on a timely basis would delay product delivery to ess s customers  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  ess s business could also be materially and adversely affected if the operations of any supplier are interrupted for a substantial period of time  or if the company is required  as a result of capacity constraints in the semiconductor industry or otherwise  to increase the proportion of wafers or finished goods purchased from higher cost suppliers in order to obtain adequate product volumes 
the markets into which ess sells its products are subject to extreme price competition 
thus  the company expects to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of its products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset or partially offset declines in the selling prices of is products  ess must continue to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts  yield improvements and other savings negotiated with its manufacturing subcontractors 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facilities and must make volume commitments to subcontractors at prices that remain fixed over certain periods of time  it may not be able to reduce its costs as rapidly as its competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
the failure of the company to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or new products with higher gross margins  or to successfully manage its manufacturing subcontractor relationships would have a material adverse effect on ess s gross margin 
indirect channels of distribution 
the company utilizes indirect channels of distribution over which the company exercises limited control 
the company derives a material percentage of product revenues from distributor channels 
the company financial results could be adversely affected if the relationship with these distributors were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of these resellers or distributors were to decline 
in addition  as the company business grows  the company may have an increased reliance on indirect channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or expanding these indirect channels of distribution 
this could result in the loss of certain sales opportunities 
furthermore  the partial reliance on indirect channels of distribution may reduce the company visibility with respect to future business  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast orders 
customer concentration 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in  and sales to the company s top five customers  including sales to distributors  accounted for approximately  and respectively  of the company s net revenues 
in  dynax  a hong kong distributor  and digital av each accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues 
in  dynax and shinco accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues 
in  dynax and shinco accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues 
sales to distributors are generally subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return and price protection with respect to unsold products 
returns and allowances in excess of reserves could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the company expects that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of the net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern may continue 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of such major customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  since the company s products are often the sole sourced to its customers  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
management of growth 
the company has experienced significant growth in unit shipments and the addition of multiple product lines that require additional management systems and processes 
to manage its future operations and growth effectively  the company will need to hire and retain management  hire  train  motivate  manage and retain its employees  continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems and implement additional systems and controls 
the competition for highly skilled worker is intense  especially in silicon valley 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage such growth effectively  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international operations 
during  and  international sales accounted for a substantial majority of the company s net revenues 
substantially all of the company s international sales were to customers in hong kong  taiwan  japan  china  korea  singapore  germany and india 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of the company s products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
due to its reliance on international sales and foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international trade relationships 
although the company has not to date experienced any material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of such regulatory  geopolitical and other factors  there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
currently  all of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with foundries and assembly and test vendors provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
with respect to international sales that are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies can increase the effective price of  and reduce demand for  the company s products relative to competitive products priced in the local currency 
since a significant number of ess s current and prospective customers and suppliers are located overseas  protective trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture or sell its products in foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the company has not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although the company may do so in the future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or require the company to modify its current business practices 
also both the company and vialta have international offices primarily in china  taiwan  hong kong and canada 
as of february   a total of employees were working outside of united states  engaged in research and development activities  marketing  sales and support activities 
thus the company is subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international offices  including political instability in the region  unexpected change in policy  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control

as a result  these shareholders  acting together  possess significant voting power over the company  giving them the ability among other things to influence significantly the election of the company s board of directors and approve significant corporate transactions 
such control could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of the company  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company 
volatility of stock price 
the price of the company s common stock has in the past and may continue in the future to fluctuate widely 
future announcements concerning the company  its competitors or its principal customers  including quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations or litigation may cause the market price of the company s common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies

in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in rates  the company invests in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for a sale  and at december   the fair market value of the company s investments approximated their costs 
risk associated with investment the company is exposed to fluctuations due to changes in the market price of shares of cisco systems held as marketable securities by the company 
in absence of use of hedging instruments  the fluctuations could have material adverse impact on the company s net income should the company decide to sell its investments in a loss position
