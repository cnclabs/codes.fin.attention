item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview avanir pharmaceuticals  based in san diego  is a pharmaceutical development company with an fda approved drug currently on the market 
avanir is engaged in research  development  commercialization  licensing and sales of innovative drug products and antibody generation services 
founded in  avanir s first ten years were focused primarily on developing abreva docosanol cream  a topical treatment for cold sores 
since then  avanir has developed a pipeline of products in both clinical and pre clinical stages of development 
two products in clinical development are focused on treatments for emotional lability in patients with lou gehrig s disease and for neuropathic pain 
the company s pre clinical research programs are focused on large therapeutic areas  including novel treatments for allergy and asthma  inflammation  and cholesterol reduction 
in july  the fda formally approved our new drug application for abreva as an over the counter otc product 
in october  smithkline beecham now glaxosmithkline began manufacturing and distributing abreva in the united states under an exclusive license agreement for the north american market 
by march  abreva became the number one selling cold sore medication in the otc market place and by september was ranked number five among the top selling new consumer healthcare products launched in the last year 
also in mid  avanir formed a subsidiary  xenerex biosciences  for the purposes of focusing on antibody generating services for other pharmaceutical companies and to develop antibodies for our own disease targets 
in a little over a year since starting its operations in a newly designed facility in september  xenerex has entered into research collaboration agreements with two biotechnology companies for the purposes of developing antibodies to cancer targets provided by both companies 
xenerex has made substantial progress in commercializing its proprietary antibody technology while working with its existing customers and intends to expand its marketing and sales of services to more companies in fiscal year sources of revenues since obtaining approval by the fda of abreva in july  avanir has been able to earn revenues from milestone payments and royalties from sales of abreva by glaxosmithkline 
these revenues  almost solely coming from glaxosmithkline during that period  have been an important source of funds for advancing our other programs in the development pipeline 
we expect to continue to receive royalties from abreva sales in the united states and canada for at least the next eight years 
we also have license agreements for docosanol cream in place in korea and israel and three letters of intent to license the product in southern europe  china  and in certain countries in the middle east 
revenues from licensing the product in other countries are subject to completion of milestones  are nonrecurring in nature  and depend substantially on our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the product in these and other countries 
revenues earned from antibody generation services provided by our subsidiary  xenerex biosciences  under research collaborations have been insignificant to date because of the early stage of development under existing collaborations and the revenue recognition process will not be complete until certain milestones defined in the agreements have been achieved 
xenerex is working on development of antibodies to six cancer target antigens specified by two research collaborations 
we also intend to develop additional research collaborations for several of our other drug development programs  provided they reach a stage that is attractive for partnering and can advance our development efforts 

table of contents nature of operating expenses avanir s operating expenses are influenced substantially by the amount of spending devoted to our clinical development programs and drug discovery research 
during the past two years  we have substantially expanded our drug development pipeline  which requires that we allocate significant amounts of our operating costs to research and development expense 
our spending on new business development and on general and administrative support staff tends to follow trends in our spending for research  but to a lesser extent 
other components of our operating costs include maintenance and operation of our laboratory and office facilities  depreciation  professional and consulting fees related to clinical trials and regulatory compliance  insurance  and investor relations 
we expect to incur increasing annual operating expenses for the foreseeable future  in light of our expanded product development pipeline 
our business is exposed to significant risks  as discussed in the section entitled risk factors that might affect future operations  which may result in additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales revenues and on net income from continuing operations has been immaterial during the past three years 
prices for electricity increased in early fiscal  however  our operations do not consume a substantial amount of electricity other than for providing lighting and air conditioning for our offices and laboratories

within xenerex  we spent million or of total r d expenditures on development of antibody generation technology 
the balance of r d spending was primarily related to other pre clinical programs addressing inflammation and cholesterol reduction and operation of our laboratory facilities 
in fiscal  r d expense was primarily related to drug discovery efforts in seeking out a lead compound intended for the treatment of allergy and asthma and for phase ii clinical trials of neurodex as an intended treatment for emotional lability in als and other neurodegenerative diseases 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million during fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to increased staff size and higher administrative support costs for most of fiscal as the company increased its level of operating activity in drug discovery  clinical development  and business development following approval of abreva by the fda  partially offset by lower legal expenses related to defense of claims against the company 
sales and marketing expenses

in the prior fiscal year  higher levels of r d expense were being incurred for allergy and asthma technology and for phase ii clinical trials of neurodex formerly code named avp as a potential treatment for central nervous system disorders 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses during fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal these decreased expenses primarily relate to lower staff levels for most of fiscal while we worked with the fda on obtaining approval of our new drug application for abreva  lower legal expenses related to defense of claims against the company  and lower proxy and shareholder solicitation costs of meetings held in fiscal compared with the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  during fiscal from million during fiscal year in fiscal  we maintained a lower level of marketing and sales staff  pending the fda s approval of our new drug application for abreva 
also during fiscal  we licensed the rights to market and sell abreva in north america to glaxosmithkline  which took over responsibility for marketing  sales and promotion of the product  thus eliminating any need for a sales and marketing staff to market abreva in north america 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal related to the amortization of debt issue costs and interest expense incurred on an aggregate of million in redeemable convertible debt  portions of which were outstanding for and days in fiscal litigation settlement 
during fiscal  we recorded litigation settlement expenses of million in connection with settlements of litigation with the former chief executive officer and director of the company  and two other related parties 
there were no litigation settlement costs incurred during fiscal year 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a net working capital balance of million 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a net working capital balance of million 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily the result of million in cash used for investing activities  partially offset by  in cash provided by operating activities and million in cash provided by financing activities 
the million decrease in net working capital is also primarily the result of million in cash used for investing activities  which includes a million net increase in investments with maturities of longer than one year 
see also results of operations for a further discussion of operating activities during fiscal increase decrease from cash and cash equivalents net working capital net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to  in fiscal  compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal included the effects of litigation settlements of million that were paid for in common stock 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities totaled million in fiscal  including capital expenditures of million and patent costs of  net cash used for investing activities in fiscal totaled million  including capital expenditures of  and patent costs of  financing activities 
during fiscal  we received million from financing activities  repaid  in outstanding debt and paid  in dividends on preferred stock  yielding million in net cash provided by financing activities 
the amount received from financing activities in fiscal represents funds received from exercises of stock options and stock purchase warrants 
during fiscal  we received million from financing activities and repaid million in outstanding debt 
the amount received from financing activities in fiscal included sales of common stock relating to a million private placement and exercises of stock options and stock purchase warrants amounting to million 
avanir issued redeemable convertible debentures to obtain interim financing in the amount of million in november and repaid the debentures in january also  on february   we issued and sold million in series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and class j warrants to certain investors 
the balance of financing was related to annual financing of insurance premiums and other financed purchase transactions in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that avanir s revenues  as well as cash flows from operations  for fiscal will substantially depend upon royalties from sales of abreva by glaxosmithkline in north america  progress that we make in international regulatory filings in canada  europe  korea and israel and in establishing license agreements for docosanol cream  including reaching milestones under those agreements 
cash flow from operations in fiscal will also depend in part on xenerex s progress in

recent accounting pronouncements effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to revenue recognition in financial statements  including revenues earned from collaborations between companies 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s earnings 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved three statements  sfas  business combinations  sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  thus requiring all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  in applying the purchase method  sfas changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill and states the following criteria should be considered in determining the recognition of the intangible assets the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights  or the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
the requirements of sfas are effective for all business combinations completed after june  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and requires goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life to no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
application of sfas is required beginning october  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
application of sfas became effective for avanir on october  we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in august the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
is effective october  the effect of sfas on the company s financial statements has not yet been determined 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because substantially all our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is immaterial 
however  in the future we could face increasing exposure to foreign currency exchange rates as we expand international distribution of docosanol cream 
until such time as we are faced with material amounts of foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments  which can be used to hedge such risks 
we will evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures as the needs and risks should arise 
interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of years as of september  nine tenths of a year as of september  
the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while achieving attractive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
we carry some investments that we intend to hold to maturity and others that we classify as available for sale 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
in general  we would expect that the volatility of this portfolio would increase as its duration increases
