item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview our primary sources of revenue are net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
noninterest income is primarily made up of revenues generated from the sale and servicing of loans 
the primary components of noninterest income include retained interest income on automobile contracts sold  contractually specified servicing fees for the servicing of loans  late charges  gain on sale of automobile contracts and mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous servicing fee income 
other components of noninterest income include gains and losses from the sale of investment and mbs  insurance income  fees related to the sales of investment products such as mutual funds and annuities  and fee income from depository accounts 
the following chart represents selected key events in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts and their respective financial statement impact 
we anticipate that all future securitizations will be recorded as secured borrowings on the balance sheet

net interest income totaled million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
net interest income increased as more automobile contracts were held on the balance sheet as we utilized our own liquidity sources and completed securitization transactions totaling billion accounted for as secured financings 
the following table presents information relative to the average balances and interest rates on an owned basis for the periods indicated for the year ended december  average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets total investments mortgage backed securities       other short term investments       investment securities      interest earning deposits with others    total investments       total loans consumer loans       mortgage loans       commercial loans       total loans       total interest earning assets       noninterest earning assets amounts due from trusts    retained interest in securitized assets    capitalized servicing rights   premises  equipment and real estate owned    other assets   less allowance for credit losses    total    interest bearing liabilities deposits       securities sold under agreements to repurchase       fhlb advances and other borrowings       notes payable on automobile secured financing   subordinated debentures       total interest bearing liabilities       noninterest bearing liabilities amounts held on behalf of trustee    other liabilities    shareholders equity    total    net interest income and interest rate spread    net yield on average interest earning assets for the purpose of these computations  nonaccruing loans are included in the average loan amounts outstanding 
the total interest rate spread increased basis points for compared with due to an increase of basis points in the yield on interest earning assets offset with an increase in the cost of funds of basis points 
the increase in income on interest earning assets for compared with and was due primarily to a higher percentage of automobile contracts held on the balance sheet 
the increase in the cost of funds in compared to and is due to a higher interest rate environment 
the following table sets forth the changes in net interest income attributable to i changes in volume change in average portfolio volume multiplied by prior period average rate  ii changes in rates change in weighted average interest rate multiplied by prior period average portfolio balance  and iii the combined effect of changes in rates and volume change in weighted average interest rate multiplied by change in average portfolio balance compared to compared to rate rate volume rate volume total volume rate volume total dollars in thousands interest income mortgage backed securities         other short term investments     investment securities     interest earning deposits with others total loans consumer loans         mortgage loans       commercial loans     total interest earning assets        interest expense deposits        securities sold under agreements to repurchase      fhlb advances and other borrowings      notes payable on automobile secured financing   subordinated debentures     total interest bearing liabilities        net change in net interest income   provision for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated for the loans held on the balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the loans or reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of loans held on balance sheet is reduced through loan sales 
the level of allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of loans held on balance sheet and historical loss trends 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in our owned loan portfolio which can be reasonably estimated 
the provision for credit losses totaled million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was the result of a higher level of automobile contracts held on balance sheet as our securitization transactions in are predominately accounted for as secured financings 
noninterest income automobile lending income on a regular basis  we securitize automobile contracts in the asset backed securities market and retain the servicing rights 
such transactions are treated as sales to a securitization trust or as financings for accounting purpose 
for transactions treated as sales to a securitization trust  we record a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the portfolio of contracts sold less the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
for these securitizations  net interest earned on the contracts sold and fees earned for servicing the contract portfolios are recognized over the life of the securitization transactions as contractual servicing income  retained interest income and other fee income 
the components of automobile lending income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gain on sale of automobile contracts    retained interest income  net of risa amortization    contractual servicing income    other fee income    total automobile lending income    we securitized billion  billion and billion in contracts for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gain on sale of contracts totaled million in  million in and million in gain on sale of automobile contracts declined as recent securitization transactions were accounted for as secured financings 
gain on sale of contracts represented only of total revenues compared with in and in retained interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of lower amortization of the risa due to lower credit losses 
retained interest income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold  credit losses and the size of the sold portfolio 
according to the terms of each securitization transaction  contractual servicing income is generally earned at rates ranging from to per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized 
other fee income consists primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees  and has increased as a direct result of the increase in the number of contracts originated and outstanding 
our average serviced portfolio increased to billion in from billion in and billion in the following table lists each of our securitization transactions 
the first issue in was rated aa by standard poors rating service  a division of mcgraw hill  inc also known as s p  and aa by moody s investor service  inc  also known as moody s 
all issues since that time were rated aaa by s p and aaa by moody s  their respective highest long term ratings 
the money market securities for each applicable transaction were rated a by s p and p by moody s  their respective highest short term ratings

the b  d and a securitization transactions were paid in full in february  january and march  respectively 
the a securitization transaction closed on february  pro forma portfolio basis statements of operations the following pro forma portfolio basis statements of operations present our results under the assumption that all our securitization transactions are treated as secured financings rather than sales 
we believe that such a presentation is an important performance measure of our operations 
if treated as financings  no gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income is recognized 
instead  the earnings of the contracts in the trusts and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of contracts 
we refer to these pro forma results as portfolio basis statements of operations since the contracts would have remained on our on balance sheet contract portfolio if we accounted for the transactions as financings 
we monitor the periodic portfolio basis earnings of our serviced contract portfolio and believe these portfolio basis statements assist in better understanding our business 
the following tables presents the portfolio basis statements of operations and reconciliation to net income as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations

during  mortgage banking income totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in mortgage banking income from to is due to our decision to exit the mortgage banking business 
this decision resulted in the sale of our remaining mortgage banking operations in mortgage banking income in related to the sale of mortgage loan servicing rights for our owned portfolio 
the components of mortgage banking income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net gains from sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights    mortgage loan servicing income loss   other fee income  total mortgage banking income    other noninterest income other noninterest income consists primarily of investment and mbs gains and losses and insurance income 
we recorded investment and mbs losses of million for the year ended december  compared with gains of million and million in and  respectively 
the loss on investments and mbs recorded in was mainly the result of hedging activities related to the potential issuance of debt 
the gains in and were the result of the sale of million and million  respectively  of investment securities and mbs during those years 
insurance income  which totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  includes premiums and commissions earned on insurance and insurance related products  including collateral protection and credit life insurance 
income from the sale of mutual funds and annuities totaled million in  million in and million in noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
noninterest expense as a percentage of total revenues improved to in compared to in and in our ability to keep noninterest expenses relatively flat while significantly growing our business is the result of efficiency improvement strategies initiated in our automobile finance operations as well as the result of us exiting the mortgage banking business 
income taxes we file federal and certain state tax returns on a consolidated basis 
other state tax returns are filed for each subsidiary separately 
our effective tax rate was in compared with and in and  respectively

the commercial banking division had deposits of million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of united states agency and treasury securities and is classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the portfolio is reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity 
this portfolio is maintained primarily for liquidity purposes in accordance with regulatory requirements 
we also hold fhlb stock  which is carried at cost  as required by our affiliation with the fhlb system

loan portfolios mortgage loan portfolio we have from time to time originated mortgage products that we have held on our balance sheet rather than selling such products into the secondary markets 
other than mortgage loans originated through the commercial banking division on a limited basis  we are not adding newly originated mortgage loans to our balance sheet 
our total mortgage loan portfolio  including those held for sale  consisted of the following december  amount amount dollars in thousands single family residential loans first trust deeds   second trust deeds   multifamily residential loans   construction loans   other   less undisbursed loan proceeds   total mortgage loans   the following table sets forth information on the amount of fixed rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans  also known as arms  net of undisbursed loan proceeds  in our portfolio december  amount amount dollars in thousands fixed rate loans   adjustable rate loans with negative amortization   without negative amortization   total mortgage loans   consumer loan portfolio our consumer loan portfolio  including those held for sale  consisted of the following december  amount amount dollars in thousands automobile contracts   other   the increase is the result of more automobile contracts held on the balance sheet as our securitization transactions are accounted for as secured financings 
commercial loan portfolio we had outstanding commercial loan commitments of million at december  compared with million at december  during  we originated million of commercial loans compared with million during though we continue to focus on expanding our commercial banking operation  it was not a significant source of revenues for the year ended december  amounts due from trusts the excess cash flows generated by contracts sold to each of the securitization trusts is deposited into spread accounts by the trustee under the terms of the securitization transactions 
in addition  at the time a securitization transaction closes  we advance additional monies to our subsidiary which originated the securitization trust to initially fund these spread accounts 
for transactions treated as sales  we establish a liability associated with the use of the spread account funds  which is reduced as such funds reach predetermined funding levels 
we are released from these obligations after the spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
the amounts due from trusts represent amounts due to us that are still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts for transactions treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease is the result of a reduction in the outstanding amount of securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes 
retained interest in securitized assets risa is capitalized upon the sale of contracts to securitization trusts 
risa represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received by us from the excess spread created in securitization transactions 
future cash flows are calculated by taking the coupon rate of the contracts securitized less the interest rate paid to the investors less contractually specified servicing fees and guarantor fees  after giving effect to estimated credit losses and prepayments 
risa is classified in a manner similar to available for sale securities and as such is marked to market each quarter 
market value changes are calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using a current market discount rate 
any changes in the market value of the risa are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated statements of financial condition as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the carrying value of the risa in light of the actual performance of the underlying contracts and make adjustments to reduce the carrying value  if appropriate 
selected original assumptions used to estimate future cash flows for contracts securitized in  and were as follows for the three months ended  march june september december a cumulative net credit losses average monthly abs prepayment speed discount rate weighted average remaining maturity in months a b c cumulative net credit losses average monthly abs prepayment speed discount rate weighted average remaining maturity in months a b c cumulative net credit losses average monthly abs prepayment speed discount rate weighted average remaining maturity in months at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the risa to immediate and adverse changes in assumed economics were as follows december  dollars in thousands fair value of the risa  abs prepayment speed monthly rate fair value after adverse change  fair value after adverse change  cumulative net credit losses pool life rate fair value after adverse change  fair value after adverse change  discount rate annual rate fair value after adverse change  fair value after adverse change  cash flows from securitization trusts for securitization transactions treated as sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the balance of contracts days or more delinquent included in such securitization trusts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
net chargeoffs for these securitization trusts totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the components of the risa for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at the beginning of period    additions    amortization    change in unrealized gain loss on risa   change in unrealized gain loss on risa represents the effect that current changes in interest rates have on the valuation of the risa 
such amount will not be realized unless the risa is sold 
the following tables presents the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be received from securitizations treated as sales december  dollars in thousands estimated net undiscounted cash flows   off balance sheet allowance for credit losses   discount to present value   retained interest in securitized assets   outstanding balance of contracts sold through securitizations   off balance sheet allowance for credit losses as a percent of contracts sold through securitizations the decline in the off balance sheet allowance for credit losses both on a dollar and percent basis is the result of our securitization transactions no longer being treated as sales 
older transactions treated as sales have lower losses each month after securitization as estimated future credit losses are realized 
we believe that the off balance sheet allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in the sold portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
asset quality overview nonperforming assets  repossessions  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by us as key measures of asset quality 
asset quality  in turn  affects our determination of the allowance for credit losses 
we also take into consideration general economic conditions in the markets we serve  individual loan reviews  and the level of assets relative to reserves in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
automobile loan quality we provide financing in a market where there is a risk of default by borrowers 
chargeoffs directly impact our earnings and cash flows 
to minimize the amount of credit losses we incur  we monitor delinquent accounts  promptly repossess and remarket vehicles  and seek to collect on deficiency balances 
at december   the percentage of accounts delinquent days or greater was compared with at december  and at december  we calculate delinquency based on the contractual due date 
net chargeoffs on average contracts outstanding for the year ended december  were compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stricter underwriting guidelines  the successful implementation of our multiple credit scoring models  a greater concentration of prime automobile contracts in our portfolio and an improved servicing platform have all contributed to better asset quality

real estate loan quality the following table of mortgage delinquencies over days by loan type highlights the fact that real estate loan delinquencies have stabilized over the past three years december  amount amount amount past due past due past due over of over of over of days category days category days category dollars in thousands single family    multifamily  construction nonperforming assets npas consist of nonperforming loans  also known as npls  chapter bankruptcy accounts greater than days delinquent and real estate owned  also known as reo 
reo is carried at lower of cost or fair value 
npls are defined as all nonaccrual loans 
this includes mortgage loans days or more past due  impaired loans where full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured and automobile contracts that are contractually past due greater than days and are in chapter bankruptcy 
npas decreased million to million at december  compared with million at december  at december   npas represented of total assets compared with at december  there were no impaired loans at december  compared with million at december  when a loan is designated as nonaccrual  all previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed 
for the years ended december   and  interest on nonperforming loans excluded from interest income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses was million at december  compared to million at december  the allowance for credit losses and related provisions are determined by considering loan volumes  loan sales  prepayments  loss trends  levels of npls  management s analysis of market conditions  individual loan reviews  levels of assets to reserves and other relevant factors 
the allowance for credit losses is reduced by net chargeoffs as well as decreases in required allowances due to sales of loans and increased by the provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses was million compared with million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net chargeoffs for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for credit losses is the result of a greater percentage of automobile contracts held on balance sheet 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
no single loan  borrower or series of such loans comprises a significant portion of the total portfolio

capital resources and liquidity overview we require substantial capital resources and cash to support our business 
in addition  as a member of the fhlb  the bank is required to maintain a specified ratio of cash  short term united states government and other qualifying securities to net withdrawable accounts and borrowings payable in a year or less 
the required liquidity ratio is currently 
the bank has maintained liquidity in excess of the required amount during our ability to maintain positive cash flows from operations is the result of consistent managed growth  favorable loss experience and efficient operations 
in addition to our indirect statement of cash flows as presented under generally accepted accounting principles  we also analyze the key cash flows from our automobile lending operations on a direct basis excluding certain items such as the purchase or sale of loans 
the following table shows our operating cash flows for our automobile lending operations for the year ended december  dollars in thousands cash flows from owned loans    cash flows from trusts    contractual servicing income    other fee income    less dealer participation    operating costs    operating cash flows    operating cash flows from automobile lending operations improved in compared with and as a result of the improving credit quality of our portfolio as well as improved operating efficiency and declining dealer participation rates on automobile contracts 
principal sources of cash we employ various sources to fund our operations  including collections of principal and interest from loans  deposits  securitizations  commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  repurchase agreements  subordinated debentures and other borrowings 
the sources used vary depending on such factors as rates paid  maturities  and the impact on capital 
collections of principal and interest from loans our primary source of funds is the collection of principal and interest from loans originated 
for automobile contracts  these monies are deposited into collection accounts established in connection with each securitization transaction  or into our accounts for contracts not in a securitization 
pursuant to reinvestment contracts entered into in connection with each securitization transaction  we receive access to the amounts deposited into each collection account and the amounts held in the spread accounts for each securitization transaction 
we use those amounts so received in our daily operations to fund the purchase of automobile contracts or to cover the day to day costs of our operations 
for real estate loans and mbs  principal and interest are deposited into our own accounts and such amounts are also used in our daily operations 
total loan and mbs principal and interest collections totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in principal and interest collections is primarily due to an increase in the amount of automobile contracts serviced 
deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public  commercial enterprises and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
we offer regular passbook accounts  demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  certificate of deposit accounts and individual retirement accounts 
our retail banking division gathers deposits from retail branch locations throughout california 
our commercial banking division gathers deposits by establishing commercial relationships with businesses located throughout southern california 
the following table sets forth the amount of our deposits by type at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands no minimum term demand deposit accounts      passbook accounts      money market accounts     noninterest bearing deposits      certificate accounts certificates days to five years      iras      brokered deposits     the variety of deposits we offer has allowed us to remain competitive in obtaining funds and provided us the flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand and competitive pressures 
generally  as other financial institutions  we have become more subject to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
our ability to attract and maintain deposits and control our cost of funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions 
the following table summarizes our average certificate accounts outstanding for the year ended december  dollars in thousands average certificate accounts outstanding   average interest rate paid deposit accounts  subject to certain fdic attribution rules  are insured by the fdic up to  per customer 
our maturities of certificate accounts greater than or equal to  were as follows december  dollars in thousands three months or less  over three months through six months   over six months through one year   over one year through three years   over three years   contract sales and securitizations since  we have securitized over billion of automobile receivables in public offerings  making us the fourth largest issuer of such securities in the nation 
for the year ended december   we securitized billion  as compared to billion for the year ended december  and billion for the year ended december  on february   we completed the issuance of billion of notes secured by automobile contracts 
we expect to continue to use securitization transactions as part of our liquidity strategy when appropriate market conditions exist 
borrowings and other sources of funds our other sources of funds include commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  sales of securities under agreements to repurchase  other borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we select from among these funding alternatives based on the timing and duration of our cash needs  as well as the costs  maturities and other requirements of each funding source 
the fhlb system functions in a reserve capacity for savings institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances from the fhlb on security of such stock and on certain residential mortgage loans 
the bank has been pre approved for advances up to of its assets  based on remaining availability under credit facilities established by the bank with the fhlb  with hours notice 
such borrowings may be made pursuant to several different programs offered from time to time by the fhlb 
additional funds are available subject to additional collateral and other requirements 
each credit program has its own interest rate  which may be fixed or variable  and range of maturities 
the fhlb prescribes the acceptable uses to which advances pursuant to each program may be put  as well as limitations on the sizes of advances and repayment provisions 
savings associations such as the bank also have authority to borrow from the frs  discount window 
frs regulations require these institutions to exhaust all reasonable alternative sources of funds  including fhlb sources  before borrowing from the frs 
federal regulations have been promulgated which connect cra performance with access to long term advances from the fhlb to member institutions 
the bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent cra evaluation 
subordinated capital debentures in and  we issued million of and million of subordinated capital debentures due and  respectively  of which million was outstanding at december  in addition to providing additional liquidity  the bank is permitted to include million of these debentures in supplementary capital for purposes of determining compliance with risk based capital requirements

principal uses of cash acquisition of loans or investment securities our most significant use of cash is for the acquisition of loans  mbs or other investment securities 
during  loan originations totaled billion compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
we purchased million of mbs and other investment securities during compared with million and million during and  respectively 
payments of principal and interest on securitization transactions under the terms of our reinvestment contract  we fund quarterly payments of interest and principal to noteholders and certificateholders derived from the cash flows received on the securitized contracts 
payments of principal and interest to noteholders and certificateholders totaled billion during compared with billion and billion during and  respectively 
amounts paid to dealers consistent with industry practice  we generally pay dealer participation to the originating dealer for each automobile contract purchased 
participation paid to dealers during totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
typically  the acquisition of prime quality contracts higher up the prime credit quality spectrum requires a higher amount of participation paid to the dealer due to increased level of competition for such contracts 
advances to spread accounts at the time a securitization transaction closes  we are required to advance monies to initially fund the spread account 
additionally  these spread accounts are required to increase beyond the initial spread account funding to predetermined levels 
these spread accounts increase through receipt of excess cash flows until these predetermined levels are met 
the amounts due from trusts represent funds due to us that have not yet been disbursed from the spread account on securitization transactions treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december   including initial advances not yet returned  was million compared with million at december  see business transactions with related parties wfs reinvestment contract 
advances due to servicer as the servicer of automobile contracts sold in securitizations  we periodically make advances to the securitization trusts to provide for temporary delays in the receipt of required payments by borrowers in accordance with servicing agreements 
we receive reimbursement of these advances through payments from the obligors on the automobile contracts or from the trustee at the time a contract liquidates 
operating our business our largest operating expenditure is salaries and benefits paid to our associates 
other amounts include occupancy costs  costs associated with collection and repossession  telephone and data processing costs 
we also use substantial amounts of cash in capital expenditures for automation and new technologies to remain competitive and to become more efficient

capital requirements the bank is a federally chartered savings bank 
as such  it is subject to certain minimum capital requirements imposed by firrea and fdicia 
fdicia separates all financial institutions into one of five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
in order to be considered well capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier or core risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater and not be subject to any ots order 
the bank currently meets all of the requirements of a well capitalized institution

accounting pronouncements the fasb has provided guidance for the way enterprises report information about derivatives and hedging 
these statements require all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are hedges will be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments directly through income or recognized through other comprehensive income on the balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the nature of the hedges 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings if the derivative is a fair value hedge 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value for a cash flow hedge will be recognized in comprehensive income on the balance sheet if the hedge is less than effective or in earnings if the hedge is greater than effective 
we adopted fasb s new guidance on january  and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to other comprehensive income of million  net of income tax  which represents the deferred loss on hedge agreements outstanding at january  however  we do not expect that the adoption of fasb s new guidance for these agreements will have a material effect on our earnings 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  also known as sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  other provisions of the statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and include additional disclosure requirements and changes related to the recognition and reclassification of collateral 
we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our earnings or financial position 
forward looking statements included in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k are several forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are those which use words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  may  will  should  estimate  continue or other comparable expressions 
these words indicate future events and trends 
forward looking statements are our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from historical results or from those anticipated by us 
the most significant risks and uncertainties we face are the level of chargeoffs  as an increase in the level of chargeoffs will decrease our earnings  the ability to originate new contracts in a sufficient amount to reach our needs  as a decrease in the amount we originate will reduce our earnings  a decrease in the difference between the average interest rate we receive on the contracts we originate and the rate of interest we must pay to fund those contracts  as a decrease will reduce our earnings  the continued availability of sources of funding for our operations  as a reduction in the availability of funding will reduce our ability to originate contracts  the level of notes treated as secured financings  as the level will impact the timing of revenue recognition  the level of operating costs  as an increase in those costs will reduce our net earnings  the effect of new laws  regulations and court decisions  and a change in general economic conditions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk fluctuations in interest rates and early prepayment of loans and mbs are the primary market risks facing us 
the credit and pricing committee is responsible for setting credit and pricing policies and for monitoring credit quality 
our asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks 
asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the asset liability committee closely monitors interest rate and prepayment risks and recommends policies for managing such risks 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
this analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points on our assets and liabilities and measures the resulting increase or decrease to the net portfolio value  also known as npv  of our assets and liabilities 
another important measurement of our interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest sensitive assets that reprice versus the amount of interest sensitive liabilities that also reprice within a defined period of time 
we have more interest sensitive liabilities rather than assets repricing in shorter term maturity buckets and more interest sensitive assets rather than liabilities repricing in longer term maturity buckets 
in general  an increase in interest rates would more adversely affect our npv than would a decrease in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our maturity gap position interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  within months year to years to after months to year years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities    other investments   mortgage backed securities       total investments       consumer loans       mortgage loans adjustable rate    fixed rate      construction loans   commercial loans       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities deposits passbook accounts     demand deposit and money market accounts     certificate accounts      fhlb advances     securities sold under agreements to repurchase   notes payable on automobile secured financing      subordinated debentures    other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities       excess interest earning bearing assets liabilities       effect of hedging activities      hedged excess deficit       cumulative excess deficit       cumulative difference as a percentage of total interest earning assets based on contractual maturities adjusted by our historical prepayment rate 
based on interest rate repricing adjusted for projected prepayments 
based on assumptions established by the ots 
based on contractual maturity 
includes effect of interest rate caps and swaps on the mbs portfolio as of december  we utilize a variety of means in order to manage interest rate risk 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we enter into various hedge agreements 
generally  we enter into these hedge agreements in amounts that correspond to the principal amount of the contracts originated 
the market value of these hedge agreements is designed to respond inversely to potential changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
we use highly rated counterparties and further reduce our risk by avoiding any material concentration with a single counterparty 
credit exposure is limited to those agreements with a positive fair value and only to the extent of that fair value 
we currently hedge substantially all of our pending securitization transactions 
we then sell or transfer contracts to securitization trusts that in turn sell asset backed securities to investors 
by securitizing our contracts  we are able to lock in the gross interest rate spread between the yield on such contracts and the interest rate on the asset backed securities 
gains or losses relative to hedge agreements are deferred and recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization transaction is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the securities issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
we have entered into or committed to interest rate caps and interest rate swaps as hedges against market value changes in designated portions of our mbs portfolio to manage interest rate risk exposure 
these financial instruments are also recorded at fair value and are included in the basis of the designated available for sale securities 
the interest rate differential to be paid or received is accrued and included as part of interest income  thereby adjusting the overall yield on securities for which we are hedging our exposure to income over the shorter of the remaining life of the derivative instrument or the expected life of the associated asset 
when the related mbs are sold  settled or terminated  the deferred gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of mortgage banking income 
the asset liability committee monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by our senior management based upon the monitoring activities of the asset liability committee 
as a result of this approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance in this regard 
there were no material changes in market risks in the current year compared with the prior year 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of real estate loans  automobile contracts and mbs
