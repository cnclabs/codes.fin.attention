additional information relating to changes between these years is provided in the notes 
earnings earnings per share of common stock are shown after provision for dividends on preferred stock and are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
the number of common shares  the earnings per share and the rate of return earned on average common equity are as follows average shares outstanding s    earnings per share basic return earned on common equity per financial statements earnings per share in basic  when compared to basic  increased 
per share 
this increase resulted substantially from an increase in central hudson electric net operating revenues net of the cost of fuel  purchased electricity and revenue taxes 
the increase  despite a drop in cooling degree days  is due primarily to increases in electric sales to own territory commercial and industrial customers and an increase in the profits retained from sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers 
commercial sales increased due primarily to an increase in the number of customers while the increase in industrial sales resulted from increased usage by existing customers 
actual cooling degree days were lower than last year and lower than normal 
an increase in non recoverable fuel costs related to central hudson s fuel cost incentive partially offset the total increase to electric net revenues 
also contributing to the increase in earnings per share was an increase in earnings from operations of ch services due primarily to the acquisition of griffith in november another reason for the increase in earnings was the increase in central hudson gas net operating revenues net of the cost of gas and revenue taxes  largely due to an overall increase in own territory sales 
increases in residential and commercial gas sales reflect increased heating sales due to an increase in heating degree days 
actual heating degree days approximated normal for and were higher than in earnings were also favorably impacted by the corporation s common stock repurchase program for the above increases in earnings were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance costs incurred by central hudson 
that increase reflects increases in the cost of normal storm restoration efforts  gas site remediation  routine and scheduled generating plant maintenance  maintenance of gas mains and workers compensation insurance 
the increase in workers compensation insurance is due to the elimination of substantial dividends received in other items impacting earnings unfavorably were non recurring items  primarily the effect of income recorded in related to the sale of the corporation s former new york stock exchange symbol  increased depreciation on central hudson s utility plant and equipment  and  the net effect of various other items  including increases in taxes other than income taxes and the corporation s cost of capital 
earnings per share in basic  when compared to basic  decreased 
per share 
this decrease resulted primarily from increased employee welfare costs due to a favorable insurance premium adjustment recorded in  plus an increase in in labor costs charged to operations expense instead of capital construction costs 
in addition  the decrease was due to increased depreciation on central hudson s plant and equipment and an increase in maintenance costs due largely to scheduled maintenance performed on one of the electric generating plants 
the decreased earnings in were partially offset by the net effect of various nonrecurring items  including the sale of the corporation s former new york stock exchange symbol in and  in  the write off of nonrecoverable purchased power expenses 
additional offsets include increases in electric net operating revenues from an increase in own territory sales due largely to warmer summer weather cooling degree days were higher than and from sales of electricity for resale 
these increases were reduced  in accordance with the agreement s return on equity cap provision  by the deferral of revenues in excess of the cap 
gas net operating revenues remained flat compared to firm gas sales increased by  however  the resulting increase in net operating revenues in was offset by the effect of a favorable reconciling gas cost adjustment recorded in a further offsetting item was the favorable impact of the corporation s common stock repurchase program in the amount of 
the corporation has established a projection for earnings in calendar year of per share 
this projected level  which is 
per share above the actual level of per share  reflects the expected decrease in earnings of central hudson due to the removal of the roseton and danskammer plants and the expected removal of the nine mile plant from rate base and the offset to this decrease expected from increased earnings from ch services and earnings on temporary cash investments of the proceeds from the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants and the expected sale of the nine mile plant 
as a result of the corporation s strong financial condition and conservative dividend policy  the corporation expects that new business development activities will not impact the corporation s ability to maintain the current level of dividend  although no assurances can be given

industrial sales increased by partially due to increased usage by existing customers 
interruptible sales decreased by due to a reduction in boiler gas usage for electric generation 
sales of firm natural gas increased from to  resulting  in part  from a increase in heating degree days due to colder weather experienced in changes in sales from the prior year by major customer classification  including interruptible gas sales are set forth below 
also included are the changes related to energy delivery service

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the corporation s primary market risks are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases and or sales of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  power supplies and petroleum products is mitigated in several different ways 
depending on market conditions  central hudson and ch services enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase and or sale of these commodities 
central hudson also uses storage gas facilities to purchase blocks of natural gas at preheating season prices for use during the heating season 
the corporation also enters into derivative transactions to hedge market price fluctuations 
the corporation has in place an energy risk management program whose primary goal is to further manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price risk associated with commodity purchases in its operations 
the corporation s written policy and procedures for this program permit the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge price risk but prohibit their use for speculative purposes 
both central hudson and ch services have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts and over the counter contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase and or sale of natural gas  electricity and petroleum products 
central hudson has entered into derivative contracts to hedge a small portion of its total gas supply requirements as well as some purchased electric and electric sales for resale transactions 
the fair value of open positions at december   as well as the resultant net transaction gains related to derivative transactions  were not material to the corporation s financial position or results of operation 
ch services has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the purchase and sale of electricity and the value of oil inventories 
open positions at december  reflected a reduction in fair value of million  and an actual net gain approximating million was realized in for settled derivatives which offset the change in the expected price of the commodity sold or purchased 
derivative transactions occurring in were not material to the corporation s financial position or results of operation 
all hedge transactions were accounted for under the deferral method sfas  accounting for futures contracts with gains and losses from the hedging activity included in either the cost of the commodity or as an adjustment to revenues 
central hudson s exposure to commodity price risk related to its purchases of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and other power sales is also mitigated by its electric and gas cost adjustment clauses 
these adjustment clauses provide for the return or collection of costs  including risk management costs  to or from customers for costs below or in excess of base costs included in rates charged to customers 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with other risk management entities 
variations in central hudson electric fuel costs are also subject to a fuel cost incentive mechanism with an annual exposure of up to million in either additional revenues or costs 
central hudson manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings 
a portion of central hudson s long term debt consists of variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis reflecting current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual passback or recovery to or from customers 
ch services had no long term debt during or
