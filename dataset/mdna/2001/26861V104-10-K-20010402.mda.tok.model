one of these distribution companies  ameriserve  accounted for more than percent of the products purchased from the company by the burger king system in ameriserve filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on january  as of january   ameriserve owed the company  in trade receivables 
ameriserve was able to secure temporary debtor in possession funding to enable it to continue operating in the short term post bankruptcy 
restaurant services  inc rsi  a not for profit purchasing cooperative that has as its members burger king franchisees and burger king  is the exclusive purchasing agent for the burger king system of franchisee owned and company owned restaurants located in the united states

cautionary statements and risk factors this section is written to be responsive to the securities and exchange commission s plain english guidelines 
in this section the words we  our  ours and us refer only to equity marketing  inc and its subsidiaries and not any other person 
set forth below and elsewhere in this form k and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
we depend significantly on one key customer our success is largely dependent on a single customer  burger king  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
burger king has no contractual commitment to do business with us 
there can be no assurance that burger king will do business with us in the future 
the termination or a significant reduction by burger king of its business with us would adversely affect our business 
the success of our business with burger king is also partially dependent on the overall success of the burger king system  which sales could be negatively impacted by such factors as increased competition  product recalls or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  commonly know as mad cow disease 
see business equity promotions and note of notes to consolidated financial statements we face credit risk we regularly extend credit to several distribution companies in connection with our business with burger king 
failure by one or more distribution companies to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future operating results are difficult to predict we experience significant quarter to quarter variability in our revenues and net income 
the promotions business tends to include larger promotions in the summer and during the winter holiday season 
major movie and television release schedules also vary year to year  influencing the promotional schedules of our customers  as well as the particular promotions for which we are retained 
the motion picture or television characters on which the promotions business is based may only be popular for short periods of time or not at all 
there may not be comparable popular characters or similar promotional campaigns in the future 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
the success of our products depends on the popularity of licensed materials our promotional and consumer products are typically based on entertainment properties  such as characters from current motion pictures or television programs 
the success of these products depends on the popularity of the entertainment properties on which they are based 
each motion picture and television program is an individual artistic work  and its commercial success is dependent on unpredictable consumer preferences 
often we spend substantial resources in securing licenses and developing and manufacturing products prior to a release of the motion picture or television program upon which the products are based 
our customers  such as burger king  typically require delivery schedules that coincide with the release of the underlying entertainment properties 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if the entertainment properties upon which our products are based turn out to be less popular than we anticipate 
also  delays in the release of motion pictures or television programs could result in delays or cancellations of our promotions 
see business equity promotions we rely on a limited number of nonrenewable product orders a large portion of our revenues come from a relatively limited number of promotional programs by burger king  which promotions are in effect for only a limited period of time and generally are not repeated 
we must continually develop and sell new products and services for utilization in new promotional programs see business equity promotions 
many consumer products are successfully marketed for only one or two years as a result of changing consumer preferences 
accordingly  our consumer products business depends on the ability to develop and market new products associated with new entertainment properties or proprietary concepts 
there can be no assurance that any new retail product line will be successful see business equity consumer products 
the cancellation or premature termination of one or more retail product lines or promotional programs  because of our inability to renew or extend licenses which typically have terms of three years or less on favorable terms or otherwise  or a significant change in promotional practices within the quick service restaurant industry  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we or our customers will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our promotional and consumer products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 
our markets are highly competitive the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive 
our competitors  and in many cases their parent companies  include companies which have far more extensive sales and development staffs and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against such companies 
we rely on foreign manufacturers during  approximately of our products were manufactured in china 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks  including transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas and other import or export controls  and changes in governmental policies 
we face foreign currency risk as part of our business  we enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of products with entities in foreign countries 
while the vast majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  significant fluctuations in the local currencies of the entities with whom we transact business may adversely affect these entities abilities to fulfill their obligations under their contracts 
there are risks associated with acquisitions if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we intend to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or investment 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we face the risk of product liability claims products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability from claims by users of such products for damages including  but not limited to  bodily injury or property damage 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms in the future  or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
we face the risk of product recalls products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability for the costs related to product recalls 
these costs can include legal expenses  advertising  collection and destruction of product  and free goods 
our product liability insurance coverage generally excludes such costs and damages resulting from product recall 
on december   burger king announced that in cooperation with the cpsc it would conduct a voluntary recall of pokemon tm balls included with burger king kids meals 
the recall resulted primarily from the death of a month old child in sonora  california on december  we designed and manufactured trading cards and gift with purchase products based on pokemon tm for burger king 
we believe that these products met or exceeded federal safety guidelines and underwent rigorous safety testing by an independent  third party laboratory during and after production 
burger king and its franchisees incurred substantial costs in the conduct of the pokemon tm ball recall  including costs for legal expenses  advertising  collection and destruction of pokemon tm balls  and free goods 
although we strongly believe we met all of our contractual obligations with respect to the pokemon tm ball  we may be contractually required to indemnify burger king and its affiliates  including its franchisees  for some or all of these costs 
while we cannot currently estimate the amount of such costs  we believe that the payment by us of the costs incurred in the conduct of the pokemon tm ball recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of the date hereof  burger king has not requested indemnification for such costs 
a significant portion of our common stock is controlled by our officers and directors donald a 
kurz and stephen p 
robeck beneficially own approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding common stock 
mr 
kurz is our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
robeck is a member of the board of directors and serves as a consultant to us 
crown owns of the outstanding shares of the company s series a senior cumulative participating convertible preferred stock  representing  shares of common stock on an as converted basis 
these stockholders  either individually or acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we may issue preferred stock the board of directors has authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock  and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of  the holders of common stock 
on march   crown paid million to the company in exchange for  shares of series a preferred stock with a conversion price of per share 
in connection with such purchase  the company granted to crown five year warrants to purchase  shares of series b preferred stock at an exercise price of  per share  and  shares of series c preferred stock at an exercise price of  per share 
on june   crown paid an additional million to the company in exchange for an additional  shares of series a preferred stock with a conversion price of per share 
in connection with such purchase  the company granted to crown warrants to purchase an additional  shares of series b preferred stock and an additional  shares of series c preferred stock 
the conversion prices of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock are and  respectively
