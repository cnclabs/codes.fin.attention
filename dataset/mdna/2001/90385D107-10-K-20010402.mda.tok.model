as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  reflecting a net decrease of million since december  working capital as of december  was million as compared to a working capital of million as of december  the decrease in working capital since december  resulted primarily from the impact of the net loss on operations as well as additional capital lease obligations that are due within twelve months  principally for the purchase of computer equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for as compared million net cash used in operating activities for the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to enhanced collection efforts with respect to accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in the company s operating results for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million for the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures on equipment and certain computer software purchases used in the company s operations during the year ended december   as the company increased the financing of equipment purchases 
net cash used in financing activities was million for as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to additional principal payments on capital lease obligations and the company s purchase of its common stock under the stock repurchase plan discussed below  partially offset by proceeds from the issuances of common stock from stock options held by certain current and former employees of the company 
through december   the company had a working capital revolving line of credit the credit facility with a bank the bank  which was secured by the company s accounts receivable and bore interest at a rate equal to libor plus per annum 
the amount available under the credit facility was limited to the lesser of of the company s eligible accounts receivable  as defined  or million 
the credit facility expired on december  and was not renewed with the bank due to a change in ownership of the bank 
the company is in the process of securing a similar line of credit to replace the expired credit facility the replacement credit facility 
the net proceeds from the ipo  after deducting million in underwriting discounts  commissions and other costs associated with the offering  were million 
as of december   there were no remaining net proceeds from the ipo 
on october   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock the stock repurchase plan 
stock repurchases may be made periodically in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or a combination of both 
the extent and timing of these transactions will depend on market conditions and other business considerations 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares of the company s common stock under the stock repurchase plan 
on march   under the ceridian agreement  ceridian completed an up front payment to ultimate software of million  half of which is subject to the successful transfer of technology to ceridian 
assuming the successful completion of the technology transfer  ceridian will pay a monthly license fee based on i the number of employees paid using the ultimate software product  and or ii the number of checks per employee 
these payments are subject to a minimum monthly payment of  beginning in january  increasing to  per month in january with annual increases beginning in the maximum monthly payment starting in january is million  subject to annual increases beginning in ceridian may terminate the ceridian agreement at any time prior to june  if the technology transfer has not been completed at that time 
in such event  the company would be obligated to refund  to ceridian 
in addition  after five years  either party can terminate the agreement with two years notice  with ceridian retaining certain rights to use the licensed software upon termination 
subject to successful technical knowledge transfer by january   the parties expect the minimum term of the agreement to be years and that the amounts payable to ultimate  including the million already paid  will be between million and million during that period 
ceridian may acquire an equity interest in ultimate through purchases in the open market or from third parties  subject to a contractual limitation of of the company s common stock 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  cash available pursuant to the ceridian agreement  and available borrowings under the replacement credit facility  if obtained  will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased expenses especially as they relate to product development and sales and marketing  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of revenues  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based upon its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
profitability achieved in previous fiscal quarters is not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that  due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations  period to period comparisons of its operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
