item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  trend analyses and other information contained herein relative to markets for our products and trends in revenues  as well as other statements including such words as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  goal  and intend and other similar expressions involving future trends or uncertainties  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks  and our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere herein  including risk factors which may impact future operating results 
basis of presentation as a result of two new accounting pronouncements that were effective during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified dealer commissions to marketing and sales expenses and customer paid shipping and handling fees to net revenues see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
previously  dealer commission costs were reflected as a direct reduction of net revenues and customer paid shipping and handling amounts were reflected as a reduction of cost of revenues 
historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the adoption of these accounting pronouncements did not impact our current or previously reported net income 
results of operations net revenues 
our net revenues for fiscal were million  as compared to million in fiscal the percent growth reflected increased net revenues in the americas of percent and in asia pacific of percent as compared to the prior fiscal year 
despite unfavorable exchange rate movements  net revenues in europe remained flat compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenues for the discreet segment increased percent compared to the prior fiscal year 
the net revenues for the design solutions segment increased percent compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales of autocad and autocad upgrades  which are reflected in the net revenues for the design solutions segment  accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal the stronger value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million higher 
unfavorable exchange rates may have a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal international sales  including exports from the us  accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
our net revenues for fiscal were million  as compared to million in fiscal increases in asia pacific s net revenues of percent were more than offset by decreases of percent in the americas and percent in europe 
the overall decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a decline in sales of autocad and autocad lt 
on a stand alone basis  sales of autocad and autocad upgrades  which are reflected in net revenues for the design solutions segment  accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal the value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  did not have a significant impact on net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal international sales  including exports from the us  accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal product returns  consisting principally of stock rotation  are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
over the past three years  product returns as a percentage of revenues have ranged from to percent annually 
we anticipate that the level of product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by the timing of new product releases  as well as the quality and market acceptance of new products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of diskettes and compact discs  cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by silicon graphics  costs associated with transferring autodesk s software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials  shipping and handling costs  royalties  amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software  software protection locks in certain foreign markets  and cost of service contracts 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues were percent in fiscal compared to percent of net revenues in fiscal this difference was primarily due to reduced royalty costs of million that resulted from the expiration of some of our royalty arrangements in fiscal and reduced software amortization costs  offset in part by higher employee related expenses and professional fees 
cost of revenues were percent of net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent of net revenues in fiscal this difference was primarily due to increases in royalties  amortization of capitalized software for autocad  which was introduced in fiscal  and the april acquisition of vision solutions  or vision  which has relatively higher cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues than our other products 
in the future  cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues will continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales  software amortization costs  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses include salaries  dealer and sales commissions  travel and facility costs for our marketing  sales  dealer training and support personnel 
these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 
marketing and sales expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent of net revenues in the prior fiscal year 
this difference was due to lower employee related expenses of approximately million and some million less in advertising and promotion costs related to fewer launches of new or enhanced products 
marketing and sales expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the increase was largely due to increased advertising and promotional costs associated with the launch of several new and enhanced products introduced during fiscal  higher employee costs  and incremental costs due to the acquisition of vision 
we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products  to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position 
accordingly  we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers  contract development fees and costs of computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
lower facilities costs were offset by additional spending by acquired businesses 
research and development costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the difference was primarily due to higher employee related costs  higher costs related primarily to the design family of products and incremental costs due to the acquisition of vision 
we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal as we continue to support product development efforts by our market groups 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include our information systems  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative operations 
general and administrative expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent of net revenues in the prior fiscal year 
this difference was primarily due to lower employee related spending and lower spending related to information systems 
general and administrative expenses were percent of net revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the difference was primarily due to higher employee related expenses  costs incurred to ensure that our infrastructure was year compliant  consulting fees related to enhancing the information systems infrastructure  and incremental costs related to acquisitions 
we currently expect that in the coming year general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  will remain consistent with the level experienced in fiscal amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the difference between fiscal and fiscal is due to some intangibles becoming fully amortized 
the difference between fiscal and fiscal was due to increased amortization expense arising from the april acquisition of vision 
we expect amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles to continue to decline in future periods as asset balances reach the end of their respective amortization periods 
nonrecurring credits charges 
during fiscal we reversed million related to one time accruals  million of which related to a restructuring reserve  established in fiscal the accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 
during fiscal  the restructuring program was substantially completed 
nonrecurring charges in fiscal million consisted primarily of discreet logic inc  or discreet  and vision acquisition related charges and a corporate restructuring that occurred during the third quarter 
nonrecurring charges in fiscal million consisted primarily of acquisition related charges resulting from our purchase of genius cad software gmbh genius and other charges that involved the consolidation of various development centers  write off of purchased technologies associated with these development centers and the elimination of positions in asia pacific 
for additional information regarding the nonrecurring charges recorded over the past three fiscal years  see note nonrecurring charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation accrual reversal 
in fiscal  we reversed million of accruals associated with litigation matters 
of the amount  million related to final adjudication of a claim involving a trade secret misappropriation brought by vermont microsystems  inc interest and other income 
interest and other income  net was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the difference between fiscal and was related to lower investment balances resulting from cash used for share repurchase activity 
the fiscal balance includes our million reversal of an interest accrual resulting from the closure of the vermont microsystems litigation matter  and a million gain associated with the sale of various technical programs and intangible assets 
excluding these fiscal amounts  the difference in interest and other income  net between fiscal and was largely due to increases in average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from cash provided by operating activities and common stock issuances 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal consistent with fiscal  the effective tax rate for fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits and tax exempt interest  partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization 
the fiscal and fiscal rates are lower than the fiscal rate due to a relatively higher impact of these permanent items 
our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  tax exempt interest and the amount of non deductible goodwill amortization 
at january   we had gross deferred tax assets of million 
a portion of the assets recognized is realizable based on our ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities 
realization of the remaining portion of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizablility of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances 
equity in net loss of affiliate 
the million equity in net loss of affiliate represents our proportionate share of buzzsaw 
com s april through january losses 
in april  we invested an additional million in buzzsaw 
com  which we formed during the third quarter of fiscal we expect our equity in net losses of buzzsaw 
com to continue to be significant in future periods if additional investments are made 
for additional information regarding our investment in buzzsaw 
com  see note investment in affiliate buzzsaw 
com  inc in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
redspark  inc during the second quarter of fiscal  we formed redspark  inc autodesk currently maintains a majority interest in redspark  and as such the financial position and results of operations of redspark are consolidated and included within the operating expense categories of our statement of operations 
we expect to continue to consolidate redspark through most of fiscal the extent of our exposure to redspark s results of operations is dependent upon our future level of ownership interest  which will depend in part on the amount of redspark equity issued to other investors in the future 
for additional information regarding redspark  see note minority interest redspark  inc in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business combinations discreet in march  we acquired discreet in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the transaction resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately million shares of autodesk common stock in exchange for discreet s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented were restated to include the combined results of operations of discreet as though it had always been a part of autodesk 
prior to the acquisition  discreet s fiscal year ended on june as a result of differing year ends  our consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended january  were combined with discreet s financial statements for the twelve months ended december  in addition  discreet s january results have been excluded from the consolidated statement of operations as a result of changing discreet s year end to january in january  discreet recognized net revenues of million and incurred a net loss of million 
this loss was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings during fiscal vision on april   we acquired vision  a vendor of enterprise automated mapping facilities management geographic information systems am fm gis solutions 
at the time  autodesk viewed the acquisition as a unique opportunity to obtain server technology and an implementation service business that would allow autodesk to enter the enterprise market and market both vision s and autodesk s products to all levels within an organization 
of the million purchase price  which was paid in cash  million represented the value of in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  and as such  was expensed during fiscal of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to other intangibles 
as of the acquisition date  the ipr d consisted of the development of two products  vision  which was percent complete at the time  and vision electric  which was percent complete 
both projects  which were originally expected to be completed in late fiscal  have already been released 
the projects were completed at an amount approximately equal to the original estimate of million 
in valuing the developed and in process technologies at the acquisition date  we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a year period 
the projected financial results  which were discounted using a percent rate for the developed technology and a percent rate for the in process technology  were based on expectations for vision on a stand alone basis and excluded any synergistic benefits that we expected to achieve after the acquisition 
the revenue projections for the developed technologies  which considered the release dates of new products  assumed a gradual decline 
we based the revenue projections for the ipr d on expected trends in technology and the timing of our new product introductions 
although actual financial results to date have been lower than originally forecasted  autodesk has successfully integrated the vision technology with new applications and products that are expected to be released in fiscal genius on may   we entered into an agreement with genius  a german limited liability company  to purchase various mechanical cad software applications and technologies 
we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
of the total purchase price of million  which was paid in cash  million was allocated to ipr d and was expensed  million was allocated to an intangible asset  purchased technology  and million was allocated to goodwill 
as of the acquisition date  genius had initiated the research and development effort related to product features and functionality that currently resides in mechanical products such as autocad mechanical  autodesk inventor and to a lesser degree mechanical desktop 
the research and development projects were in varying stages of completion  ranging from percent to percent complete as of the acquisition date  with total estimated costs of million to reach technological feasibility at the time 
the in process projects were completed in fiscal  at an aggregate amount approximately equal to the original estimated costs to complete 
in valuing the developed and in process technologies  we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a year period 
the projected financial results were discounted using a percent rate for the developed technology and a percent rate for the in process technology 
the revenue projections for the developed technology  which considered historical product life cycles and anticipated product release dates  assumed a gradual decline over the year period 
the revenue projections for the ipr d assumed higher than historical average sales due to the integration and expansion of genius products into our worldwide sales channels  particularly in north america and asia pacific  which historically had not contributed significant revenues to genius 
actual results in fiscal were consistent with the major assumptions used in the original valuation made at the time of the acquisition  such as the revenue growth rate between years 
recently issued accounting standards effective november  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
effective february  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement requires autodesk to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
had we adopted sfas during fiscal  the impact would not have been material 
the adoption of sfas on february  did not have a material impact on our financial position 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million at january  compared to million at january  the primary uses of cash during fiscal were the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  capital and other expenditures of million  dividend payments totaling million and an additional investment in buzzsaw 
com of million 
the primary sources of cash were cash provided by operating activities of million  stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans of million  and million of third party venture funding for redspark 
between november and march  the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
of these million shares  million have been repurchased as of january  the primary purpose of the stock repurchase programs is to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans 
we have a us line of credit permitting short term  unsecured borrowings of up to million  which may be used from time to time for working capital or other business needs 
at january   there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement  which expires in january principal commitments at january   consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated short term and long term cash requirements 
long term cash requirements  other than normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products  financing anticipated growth  dividend payments  the share repurchase programs  investments in related entities  and the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business 
our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
to minimize the impact of these fluctuations  we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments  primarily certain payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency instruments generally have maturities of less than three months  and the option contracts settle before the end of each quarterly period 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
risk factors which may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations 
you should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in marketing or operating expenses  changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  delays in product releases  competitive factors  distribution channel management  changes in compensation practices  the timing of systems sales and general economic conditions 
we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period  and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 
additionally  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our business 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of low end cad products and autocad upgrades  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products  if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software  autocad upgrades  and products that are interoperable with autocad 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of autocad and autocad upgrades  including product life cycle  market acceptance  product performance and reliability  reputation  price competition and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our operating results 
existing and increased competition in the design software market may reduce our net revenues  profits and market share 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capabilities at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
since customers increasingly rely on the internet  new platforms and technologies can be expected to be developed in the design industries 
the design software market in particular is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  the availability of third party application software is a competitive factor within the cad market 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products  and to continue to provide existing product offerings  that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation  price and training 
our efforts to develop and introduce new products expose us to risks such as costs related to product defects  large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues and dependence on third party developers 
rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry 
the software products we offer are internally complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which could harm our business 
with the prevalence of new internet technologies and the demand for increased customer connectivity  new platforms and technologies can be expected to be developed in the design industries 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of such technologies as well as transitioning to new business models  requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities  while other technologies are licensed from third parties 
we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us  may not be able to provide development support to us in the future 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers  who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles 
in particular markets  this disruption could negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
our international operations expose us to significant regulatory  intellectual property  collections  exchange fluctuations and other risks  which could adversely impact our future net revenues 
we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues 
risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
our international results may also be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 
if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel  our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 
we sell our software products primarily to distributors and value added resellers  or vars 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our var network 
although we have not recently experienced any material problems with the financial viability of our var network  computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized  have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
in addition  the changing distribution models resulting from the internet  from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from two tiered distribution may impact our var network in the future 
while no single customer accounted for more than percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal  the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 
product returns by vars could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 
with the exception of some distributors  agreements with our vars do not contain specific product return privileges 
however  we permit our vars to return product in certain instances  generally during periods of product transition and during update cycles 
we anticipate that product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by product update cycles  new product releases and software quality 
we establish reserves  including reserves for stock balancing and product rotation 
these reserves are based on estimated future returns of product and  after taking into account channel inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
while we maintain strict measures to monitor channel inventories and to provide appropriate reserves  actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates  and such differences could harm our business 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
infringement  invalidity claims  or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which could harm our business 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel  particularly in northern california where we are headquartered  could harm our business 
our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees 
competition for these employees in today s marketplace  especially in the technology industries  is intense 
our ability to attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors  including our continued ability to grant stock incentive awards 
the loss of key employees or inability to recruit new employees would negatively impact our business 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel 
the transition to a single european currency could negatively impact our international operations 
as a result of the introduction of the euro and during the transition period  which will end on january   we will continue to modify the internal systems that will be affected by this conversion 
we may not be able to complete such modifications to comply with euro requirements  which could harm our business 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the introduction of the euro on our foreign exchange activities  functional currency designations  and pricing strategies in the new economic environment 
in addition  we face risks to the extent that banks and vendors upon whom we rely and their suppliers are unable to make appropriate modifications to support our operations with respect to euro transactions 
our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 
we periodically acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances  debt and equity investments  and the like 
the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies  the failure to realize anticipated synergies  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the fluctuations could arise from merger related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to quarter in our operating results and financial condition 
we periodically make investments in related entities  such as buzzsaw 
com and redspark  which typically do not expect to earn significant revenues in the initial period of operations and which incur considerable start up costs 
such investments may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline  which could harm our business 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we are currently involved in this type of litigation  and may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which could harm our business 
general economic conditions may reduce our net revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the us  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict  but it may result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles and increased price competition 
as a result  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for any given quarter in fiscal or for the entire year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and vars who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which could harm our profitability and financial condition 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
our facilities in northern california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity have risen dramatically  and will likely continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could in turn hurt our profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and other obligations  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
contracts are primarily denominated in euro  swiss francs  canadian dollars  british pounds and japanese yen 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  this analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from january  would increase the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the dollar from january  would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 
interest rate sensitivity we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as security deposits  of million at january  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus or plus basis points over month and month time horizons 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a   or basis point increase were million  million and million  respectively 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a  or basis point increase were million  million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
investments in privately held businesses we have an investment portfolio with a net book value of approximately million as of january  that includes minority equity investments in several privately held technology companies  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
with the exception of our investments in buzzsaw and redspark  we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop into commercially viable businesses 
we may incur losses related to our investments in these companies
