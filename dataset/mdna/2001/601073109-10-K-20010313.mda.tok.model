item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with millipore s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
business realignment on october   millipore announced plans to separate into two distinct companies by making its microelectronics business segment an independent  publicly traded company 
the company is planning an initial public offering for less than of the shares of the new microelectronics company and subsequently intends to spin off the remaining shares to millipore shareholders through a dividend distribution within approximately three to six months following the initial public offering 
the transaction is expected to be tax free to the company and its shareholders and is contingent upon receiving certain tax and regulatory approvals  accommodation of certain debt covenants as well as market conditions 
the full impact of the realignment on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted at this time 
however  certain expenses are expected to be incurred in future periods in order to implement the realignment 
additionally  in connection with the separation  we are currently engaged in a review of the operations and anticipate an associated restructuring charge in the first quarter of results of operations the company reported diluted earnings per share of  and for  and  respectively 
excluding unusual items  the company would have reported diluted earnings per share of  and for  and  respectively 
the company initiated a restructuring program in to streamline worldwide operations and reduce the overall cost structure 
this program is discussed in its entirety in restructuring items 
reference is also made to the discussion of gross margins  gain on sale of equity securities  and legal proceedings below for additional information related to the other unusual items on the following schedule

local currency results represent the foreign currency balances translated  in all periods presented  at millipore s budgeted exchange rates  thus excluding the impact of fluctuations in the actual foreign currency rates 
the company s management uses this presentation for internal evaluation of the financial performance of the company s business segments because it believes that the local currency results provide a clearer presentation of the underlying business trends 
the us dollar results represent the foreign currency balances translated at actual exchange rates 
net sales net sales  measured in us dollars  increased in compared to in the net sales increase in as compared to was primarily due to a continued recovery in the semiconductor industry coupled with continued growth in the biopharmaceutical business offset by negative net currency effects 
growth in the americas and asia pacific regions was heavily influenced by the improvements in the semiconductor industry 
the impact of translating sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar reduced reported sales growth by in during as compared to the japanese yen strengthened on average against the us dollar by approximately and the euro weakened against the us dollar on average by approximately 
the negative effect from the declining euro more than offset the positive effect from the stronger yen 
in the reported sales growth was positively impacted by as a result of the japanese yen which strengthened against the us dollar by approximately partially offset by the euro weakening by 
in general  a stronger us dollar will adversely affect the sales growth of both business segments 
however  since the microelectronics segment has a higher percentage of sales in asia  strengthening of the dollar against asian currencies will have a somewhat larger impact on that segment 
similarly  the bioscience previously referred to as the biopharmaceutical research segment has a higher percentage of sales in europe than the microelectronics segment 
therefore  strengthening of the dollar against the european currencies will have a larger impact on the bioscience segment sales growth 
non currency related price changes have not significantly affected the comparability of sales during the past three years 
sales growth by business segment and geography  measured in local currencies and us dollars  is summarized in the table below 
sales growth in sales growth in local currencies us dollars bioscience microelectronics consolidated americas europe asia pacific consolidated bioscience sales  measured in local currencies  increased in compared to the growth was broad based across product lines and geographies 
revenue growth was strongest for products used in life science laboratory research and in hardware and consumables used in the biopharmaceutical markets which collectively account for approximately percent of the sales of this business segment 
the growth in these markets resulted from increases in new biotech drugs approved and in production as well as continued strengthening in genomics and proteomics research spending 
bioscience sales  measured in local currencies  increased in compared to the growth was broad based across product lines and geographies 
sales growth was strongest for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets utilizing laboratory research applications  water filtration devices and consumable filtration products and systems used in drug production 
revenue growth from the sale of process systems was positive  although to a lesser extent than other product lines 
microelectronics segment sales growth measured in local currency increased in compared to this growth was the result of significant improvements in the semiconductor industry and strengthening of the asian economies  which began in sales growth for this segment was most significant in the americas and the asia pacific region and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
microelectronics segment sales growth measured in local currency increased in compared to during  the company s sales growth was positively impacted by improvements in the semiconductor industry and strengthening of the asian economies 
gross profit margins gross profit margins in local currencies were for and  and in excluding unusual items in  gross profit margins would have been 
the unusual items recorded in were a million charge for the write off of inventory and manufacturing equipment associated with product line rationalization activities and a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross profit margin percentages for as compared to were positively impacted by volume efficiencies and automation efficiencies in both segments offset by an increased mix of lower margin microelectronics business 
the percentage point gross profit increase in versus  excluding one time items  was the result of company wide increased volume as well as savings realized from the restructuring initiatives  which began in the third quarter of operating expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses in local currencies increased in and in the increase in was primarily due to higher head count and related expenses needed to support sales volume and incremental variable employee compensation earned in as compared to due to improved operating performance 
as a percentage of sales  s  g a expenses in local currencies decreased approximately points during to 
the increase in was primarily attributable to million of incremental variable employee compensation earned in over amounts earned in the preceding year due to the relative better operating performance and lower expenses in due to cost containment programs initiated as part of the restructuring activities 
the company continues to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving the company s competitive positions 
research and development expenses in local currencies increased in due to additional r d programs and increased headcount 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses in local currencies declined from in to in due to the growth in sales during during  r d decreased due to the elimination of research and development expenses for non strategic product lines in the microelectronics segment and the microelectronics consolidation into the allen  texas facility thus eliminating duplicate operations 
in  the company recorded a charge of million for past royalties as part of the settlement of a patent lawsuit 
litigation settlements totaling million were recorded in and are described under legal proceedings below 
restructuring items in the second quarter of  the company announced a restructuring program to improve the competitive position of the company by streamlining worldwide operations and reducing the overall cost structure 
the restructuring program was initiated to bring operating costs in line with lower revenues resulting from the financial difficulties in asian economies  the strong us dollar and the continuation of the semiconductor industry slump 
the combination of the restructuring programs and the microelectronics plant consolidation resulted in estimated savings of approximately million in the savings resulted from reduced wages  facility related costs  depreciation and amortization and were primarily reflected as reductions in cost of sales 
key initiatives of the restructuring program included discontinuation of non strategic product lines and rationalization of product offerings to improve product line focus 
the non strategic product lines consisted of high pressure liquid chromatography equipment  semiconductor fab monitoring and control software and various filtration devices 
the rationalization of product offerings was a result of management s review which identified specific products with limited profitability or products which were inconsistent with current strategic marketing plans  such as non standard products 
these actions to improve product line focus were completed by september  consolidation of certain manufacturing operations which eliminated duplicate manufacturing processes in ireland and the us the consolidation of manufacturing operations was completed in realignment of european country organizational structure to focus on operating business units and establishment of a regional transaction service center  resulting in the consolidation of financial and administrative activities 
the company completed the transition to the service center during reduction of administrative and management infrastructure costs in asia through reduced facility costs and administrative positions as offices in the region were consolidated during renegotiations of marketing  research and development and supply agreements 
these agreements were amended to eliminate the cost of maintaining certain exclusivity rights and to reduce purchasing commitments for non strategic products 
these actions were completed during streamlining of the supply chain management function through the centralization of worldwide procurement functions and the consolidation of vendors to significantly reduce the aggregate number of vendors  resulting in cost savings and shorter cycle time within the procurement function as well as materials cost reductions 
these actions were completed during in the third quarter of  the company recorded an expense associated with these activities of million million after tax including a restructuring charge of million and a million charge for inventory and million of fixed asset write offs against cost of sales 
the million restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs  million write off of real and intangible assets associated with discontinued product lines and with the termination of certain rights under two technology development collaboration agreements  million of lease cancellation costs and million of contract termination costs 
the company reevaluated the accrual for the restructuring program and in the third quarter of reversed million of the remaining balance 
the reversal reflects a lower estimate for employee severance and lease cancellation costs 
although the planned number of employee positions had been eliminated  the reduction in severance cost was attributed to higher levels of attrition than originally anticipated and to impacted employees filling open positions as demand increased due to improved sales volume 
during the third quarter of  the company reversed million in restructuring reserves primarily related to additional proceeds from the sale of facilities 
at december  million relating primarily to final facility closure payments remains and will be paid in early the restructuring initiatives combined with the consolidation of the company s microelectronics plants resulted in the elimination of positions worldwide 
notification to employees was completed in the third quarter of  however a small number of these employees continued in their existing positions through with their related salary costs charged to operations as incurred 
under the terms of the severance agreements  the company expects to pay severance and associated benefits through the early part of during the third quarter of  the company also recorded in cost of sales an incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million in response to adverse changes in demand attributable to declining business conditions in asia and the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
gain on sale of equity securities during the second quarter of  the company sold its holdings in oxford glycosciences plc  resulting in a gain on sale of securities of million which was partially offset by the write off of investment holdings in a privately held us company of million 
the gain on sale of equity securities in primarily reflects the sale of the company s equity holdings in perseptive biosystems 
as of december   the company held million shares of perseptive biosystems common stock and  shares of perseptive biosystems preferred stock 
on january   perseptive merged with the perkin elmer corporation 
pursuant to the merger  all of the company s holdings of common and preferred shares in perseptive were converted into an aggregate of  shares of perkin elmer common stock 
in the first quarter of  the company sold all of its shares of perkin elmer stock for approximately million in cash 
the company also sold all of its common shares of glyko biomedical ltd 
in the first quarter of and recognized a gain of million 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million in as compared primarily as a result of lower average borrowings and additional interest income from increased cash and cash equivalents offset by an increase in average rates 
during net interest expense increased million over this increase was due to higher average interest rates resulting from the renegotiation of the company s revolving credit agreement and higher effective interest due to the impact of foreign exchange under the yen debt swap agreements which was somewhat offset by lower average borrowings 
provision benefit for income taxes the company s effective tax rate on net income for and was and  respectively  and a benefit of in excluding the effect of the restructuring items recorded in and  the company s tax rate on income from operations was 
in the company s tax rate on income from operations increased to 
this increase was due to improved operating results in countries with higher tax rates 
earnings per share restructuring charges and several unusual items impacted earnings per share in  and the impact of these items is reflected in the summary of unusual items above 
in addition  earnings per share were positively impacted in as compared to by approximately per share due to the impact of a stronger yen offset by the weakening euro 
additionally  in as compared to  earnings per share were positively impacted by approximately per share as a result of the impact of the stronger yen offset by the weaker european currencies 
acquisition on may   the company acquired all outstanding shares of bioprocessing corporation limited bioprocessing in exchange for  shares of millipore common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the consolidated financial statements for prior periods were not restated because the addition of bioprocessing did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
bioprocessing develops  manufactures and sells a wide range of proprietary products and services for the chromatographic purification of proteins 
market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured both against the us dollar and each other 
the company manages these market risks through its normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not invest in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from customers outside of the americas 
this business is transacted through the company s network of international subsidiaries generally in the local currency 
this exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can impact revenues  net income and cash flow 
approximately of the company s sales are derived from europe where the us dollar strengthened against the euro during and continued strengthening of the us dollar against the euro may negatively impact the results of operations of the company 
the company is able to partially mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the euro by active management of cross border currency flows and material sourcing 
the company has significant exposure against the japanese yen which strengthened against the us dollar in and generally  a stronger yen has a positive impact on results of operations 
the company is exposed to changes in the japanese yen that can not be mitigated through normal financing or operating activities 
accordingly  the net equity exposure risk is managed through the use of debt swap agreements 
historically  the company entered into foreign currency option contracts to sell yen on a continuing basis in amounts and timing consistent with the underlying currency transactions 
this program was discontinued in the gains on these transactions  if any  partially offset the realized foreign exchange losses on the underlying exposure 
in  gains  net of premium costs  of million were realized from these contracts and were recorded in cost of sales 
all open options expired in the company s net equity exposure to the japanese yen has been hedged through debt swap agreements covering both principal and interest 
pursuant to these agreements  of debt with a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent was swapped for an equivalent value of yen at a weighted average exchange rate of yen to the dollar and a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent 
the swap agreements mature in and see capital resources and liquidity below for a discussion of cash collateralization requirements under these agreements 
although the company manages its foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar strengthens against the basket of currencies in which the company transacts its business  generally sales and net income will be adversely impacted 
credit risk the company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and derivative financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographies 
the company is exposed to credit related risks associated with the potential nonperformance by counterparties to the debt swap agreements 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and limits the amount of contracts it enters into with any one party 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow provided from operations was million in  million in and million in reported cash flow from operations was reduced by million in  million in and million in for costs associated with the restructuring program and the integration of acquisitions made during and excluding the restructuring and acquisition related expenditures  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in the decrease in cash flow from operations in over was primarily the result of increased accounts receivable and inventories offset by improved operating income 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volume primarily in the united states and asia pacific 
the increase in sales in the asia pacific region further impacted accounts receivable where regional business practices result in longer collection periods 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased from days in to days in primarily a result of the increased mix of asia pacific receivables 
the company continues to aggressively manage its collection activities 
inventory levels increased due to stocking levels of new products and efforts to increase customer service levels through increased product availability predominately in the microelectronics business segment 
partially offsetting the impact of accounts receivable and inventory increases were increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  also primarily due to higher business activity and variable compensation programs resulting from improved financial performance 
the increase in cash flow from operations in over  excluding the restructuring and acquisition expenditures  is primarily a result of improved income from operations  increases in accounts payable due to higher business activity in the fourth quarter of  accrued expenses primarily resulting from variable compensation programs and continued asset management initiatives launched in partially offsetting this is an increase in account receivables resulting from significantly higher sales volume in the second half of combined with the increased revenues in the asia pacific region 
this resulted in days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increasing from days in to days in operating cash flow generated by the company during was used to reduce short term debt  invest in property  plant and equipment  and pay dividends 
the company spent million for property  plant and equipment during the million increase versus was primarily due to additional manufacturing capacity and new laboratories for the bioscience business 
during  the company received million from the sale of property  million from the sale of securities and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be in the range of to million 
this increase will be driven by the on going need to add manufacturing capacity and laboratories for the bioscience business and capital needed to provide microelectronics a corporate headquarters and additional manufacturing capacity 
cash generated by the company during was used to reduce short term debt  to invest in property  plant and equipment and to pay dividends 
property  plant and equipment expenditures for were less than expenditures by million primarily due expenditures in of million for the expansion of the bioscience membrane manufacturing facility in cork  ireland and million for the construction of the new microelectronics manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
this decrease was offset in part by million for expenditures made in to complete the membrane manufacturing facility 
the company also received million in cash for the sale of securities in waters corporation 
cash generated by the company during was used to invest in property  plant and equipment  and to pay dividends 
property  plant and equipment expenditures for included million spent for the expansion of the bioscience membrane manufacturing facility in cork  ireland and million spent for the construction of the new microelectronics manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
the total cost of the allen facility was approximately million 
the company maintains an unsecured revolving credit agreement  dated january   with a consortium of commercial banks the credit agreement which currently makes million available to the company 
during  the company reduced its borrowings under the credit agreement to million so that  at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity of million 
the credit agreement was renegotiated during to waive defaults under certain financial covenants relating to operating cash flow and interest coverage and to permit less restrictive operating cash flow and interest coverage covenants for and a portion of the company also agreed to an additional minimum earnings covenant as well as to increases in both the interest rate and the facility fees 
as renegotiated  interest is payable under the credit agreement at a floating us dollar deposit rate  defined as libor  plus a margin in the range of to percent 
the company also has an additional million of other short term borrowing capacity available of which million was outstanding at december in november moody s investor services and standard poors corporation graded the company s debt at a rating of ba and bb  respectively 
both ratings are characterized as below investment grade 
the company expects that these ratings may make it more difficult for the company to access money markets should it become necessary to do so 
in addition  the foregoing debt ratings coupled with the strengthening of the japanese yen triggered a requirement in to provide cash collateralization under one of the company s yen denominated debt swap agreements in the event that the net value of its position was below the net value of the counterparty s position 
in the event that the company s debt rating improves  these agreements provide for less stringent collateralization requirements 
while this collateralization requirement will not impact the company s foreign exchange exposure  it could impact short term liquidity if there were a serious deterioration in the value of the company s swap position 
the amount of the cash collateral is dependent  among other things  on the exchange rate of the yen to the us dollar  generally  as the yen strengthens  the amount of cash collateral required from the company increases 
at december   this cash collateralization amount was million 
the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the credit agreement and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months 
dividends the quarterly dividend was per share throughout the company paid dividends of million in euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  in the first quarter of  the company began invoicing certain customers and intercompany transactions in the euro 
the company also assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
it also has evaluated its cash management opportunities 
further  the company has commenced a plan to upgrade its computer systems to enable business transactions in the euro effective january legal proceedings in  the company recorded a charge of million for past royalties as part of the settlement of a patent lawsuit 
on july  amersham pharmacia biotech ab apb of sweden filed a complaint in the high court of justice in the united kingdom against the company and two of its subsidiaries alleging that the sale of the company s isopak chromatography valve infringed one or more of the claims contained in certain apb patents 
apb sought an injunction against the alleged infringement as well as damages 
on october   the high court ruled that the chromatography valve currently sold by the company did not infringe the apb patents 
apb has been granted leave to appeal this decision 
the high court also ruled that a discontinued product did infringe one of said patents 
a hearing on damages will be scheduled with respect to this matter 
in any event  the outcome of this suit is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company first disclosed this matter in a press release issued during the third quarter of in  the company recorded a litigation settlement of million related to matters a proceeding arising out of an administrative order issued by the environmental quality board eqb of puerto rico alleging that the company s wholly owned subsidiary failed to properly manage  transport and dispose of nitrocellulose membrane scrap as a hazardous waste  and proposed penalties in the amount of million 
the company settled this proceeding in and recorded a charge of million 
a private lawsuit brought by an intervening party in the eqb administrative case described above  the company recorded a charge of million in the reflecting its costs to settle this suit 
a patent lawsuit with mott metallurgical corporation in which each party claimed infringement of one of its patents by the other 
the company recorded a charge of million in to settle this suit  the parties also agreed to cross license the two patents at issue 
as has been previously disclosed  millipore has  in the past  been named as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of superfund by the us environmental protection agency epa with respect to a release as defined in section of superfund  at twelve sites to which chemical wastes generated by the manufacturing operations of millipore or one of its divisions may have been sent 
the company has settled its liability pursuant to consent decrees releasing millipore from further liability with respect to certain covered matters at all of these superfund sites 
however  as is typical with consent decrees in such superfund proceedings  epa and the relevant state agencies have reserved the right to maintain actions against the settling parties  including the company  in the event certain events occur or do not occur at those sites 
the company does not expect that the conditions in the consent decrees permitting these governmental parties to re open the cases will occur 
in any event  the company believes that the aggregate of any future potential liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations or financial condition in light of the advanced stage of funded remedial action at each site and the likely availability of contribution from numerous other financially solvent prps participating at each such superfund site 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 which is effective january  for the company 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
with respect to all derivative instruments  sfas no 
requires that companies record an adjustment to record the difference between a derivative s previous carrying amount and its current fair market value as a transition adjustment 
at december   the company is a party to us dollar to japanese yen foreign currency fixed rate to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements  which are designated as a hedge of the company s net investment exposure in its japanese subsidiary 
the company will record a transition adjustment of million  on january   to record the difference between the company s carrying value and the fair value of this derivative 
this transition adjustment will be recorded as a cumulative effect type adjustment to other comprehensive income 
business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
business realignment on october   millipore announced plans to separate into two distinct companies by making its microelectronics business segment an independent  publicly traded company 
the company is planning an initial public offering for less than of the shares of the new microelectronics company and subsequently intends to spin off the remaining shares to millipore shareholders through a dividend distribution within approximately three to six months following the initial public offering 
the transaction is expected to be tax free to the company and its shareholders and is contingent upon receiving certain tax and regulatory approvals  accommodation of certain debt covenants as well as market conditions 
restructuring charges and separation expenses in connection with the separation  the company is currently engaged in a review of operations and anticipates an associated restructuring charge in the first quarter of costs could be incurred within both business segments to reduce manufacturing capacity  terminate certain contracts and leases and relocate operations closer to individual business segment customer base  although the specific nature and amount of the charges is not known at this time 
sales the semiconductor industry in which the microelectronics business segment participates is highly cyclical 
a downturn  which began in the middle of  continued into early since then  this business segment reported eight sequential quarters of increased sales during and recent industry results and published reports indicate that an industry wide decline has begun 
we expect microelectronics revenues to be to lower in the first quarter of than revenues in the fourth quarter of while some published reports suggest little or no growth for  others remain optimistic that growth will return to this market in the second half of there can be no assurance as to the extent and duration of this cyclical downturn or as to its impact on millipore  however  the company does anticipate growth over the long term 
the bioscience segment has demonstrated relatively stable patterns of revenue growth 
customers in this segment  particularly those involved in the production of sterile drugs  purchase products for use in validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of new drugs in order to be designed into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
the growth of this segment is highly dependent on the development and approval of new drugs 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals  however  the number of drugs at various stages in the approval process has increased over the past two years 
the remaining driver of this segment is life science research and development spending 
recently published industry reports in the area of life science anticipate increased research and development spending 
however the impact on the company is unknown 
during and  the company has seen relatively flat sales growth in the european region  in us dollars  which resulted from increased sales growth  in local currencies  offset by the effect of the declining euro 
this region impacts the bioscience segment more than the microelectronics segment 
the recent economic pressures in europe combined with the us dollar strengthening against most european currencies may continue to adversely affect the bioscience segment in in the asia pacific region  the company has benefited principally from the strong growth of the microelectronics industry 
this growth combined with the strengthening of the yen has further contributed to the positive growth rate 
approximately percent of the company s sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally made in local currency 
as previously noted  currencies had a net negative impact to both sales and earnings in as compared to this was the composite result of a stronger yen in mostly offset by the weak euro 
since the end of  the dollar has strengthened against the yen and the euro 
therefore  if rates of exchange remain at the march  level  there could be a significant negative impact on sales for the first quarter and full year as compared to gross margins the company expects lower gross margin percentages  in local currencies  in as compared to the lower microelectronics revenues will negatively impact margins by reduced absorption of manufacturing overhead combined with margin reductions due to sales growth for process systems which traditionally have lower gross margins  increased costs of certain raw materials and labor  continued new product start up costs and volume driven pricing arrangements 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar remain at march  levels  first quarter and full year margins could be significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in december the company s sole supplier of a critical raw material used in the manufacture of one type of membrane incorporated into products sold by the bioscience business segment advised the company that it would discontinue manufacture of that raw material during the second half of in the second quarter of the company established supply arrangements with a successor company to the former supplier of this raw material 
in addition  the company is in the process of identifying alternative sources of supply of this material 
the company believes that these arrangements will provide an adequate source of supply for this raw material 
operating expenses without the impact of the spin off of microelectronics and any assumed restructuring charge  the company expects that operating expenses in local currencies  as a percentage of sales  in will be greater than the percentage achieved in the previous year primarily as a result of the lower microelectronics revenues 
interest expense the company expects net interest expense in will be slightly lower than as a result of lower average debt 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in  is projected to be approximately  or greater than the effective rate for  excluding unusual items 
the tax rate estimate is based on the company s current expectations for income  current tax law and the expectation that the company s revenues could reflect a higher proportion of income generated by products manufactured in the united states  and therefore is subject to change 
additionally  the impact of the spin off on the overall tax rate can t be determined at this time 
further  in the event that the company s cash needs significantly increase above those currently projected and exceed the resources identified under capital resources and liquidity above  then an additional upward influence on the company s tax rate could develop if the company were required to repatriate cash from certain foreign operations 
capital spending the company expects to spend between to million for fixed asset additions in this increase will be driven by the on going need to add manufacturing capacity and laboratories for the bioscience business and capital needed to provide microelectronics a corporate headquarters and additional manufacturing capacity 
the company will continue to invest in tooling within its manufacturing plants  upgrades of its research and development labs and in information technology 
accordingly  the company also expects that depreciation expense will be higher than reported in capital resources and liquidity the company intends to liquidate its yen denominated debt swap agreement in the first quarter of at current rates of exchange  the impact on liquidity is approximately million
