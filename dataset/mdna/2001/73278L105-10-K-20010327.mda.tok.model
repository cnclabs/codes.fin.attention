the company s effective tax rate remained constant at in seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is highly seasonal 
weather is the principal external factor affecting the company s business 
hot weather can increase pool installations and the purchase of chemicals and supplies 
unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts of rainfall during the peak selling season can decrease pool installations and the purchase of chemicals and supplies 
in addition unseasonably early or late warming trends can increase or decrease the length of the pool season and consequently the company s sales 
in general sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when the company may incur net losses 
in approximately of the company s net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year which represent the peak months of swimming pool use installation remodeling and repair and approximately of the company s operating income was generated in the same period 
the company experiences a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the first and second quarters of the year in anticipation of the peak selling season 
the company s peak borrowing occurs during the second quarter primarily because extended payment terms offered by the company s suppliers typically are payable in april may and june while the company s peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june july and august 
to encourage preseason orders the company like many other swimming pool supply distributors utilizes preseason sales programs that provide for extended payment terms and other incentives to its customers 
some of the company s suppliers also offer extended payment terms on certain products to the company for preseason or early season purchases 
in offering extended payment terms to its customers and accepting extended payment terms from its suppliers the company effectively finances a portion of its receivables with extended payables 
the company expects that its quarterly results of operations will fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new service centers and acquisitions 
the company attempts to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations continued the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for and which in the opinion of management reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of such data

borrowings are used to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
the company s borrowings under its senior loan facility together with cash flows from operations and seller financing historically have been sufficient to support the company s growth and to finance acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in from million in a million increase in net income was offset by an increase in cash used in operations primarily due to substantial purchases of product inventories made in the fourth quarter of intended to maximize vendor programs and to take advantage of current vendor pricing levels in anticipation of price increases in net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in an increase in net income provided million of the increase while a decrease in use of cash for operating assets liabilities and activities provided the remaining million 
the decrease in the use of cash was primarily due to improved management of working capital

during the twelve months ended december the company made required scheduled principal payments of million on the term loan which had a balance of million at december scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued borrowings under the senior loan facility may at the company s option bear interest at either i the agent s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus whichever is higher plus a margin ranging from to or ii libor plus a margin ranging from to in each case depending on the company s leverage ratio 
substantially all of the assets of the company including the capital stock of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries secure the company s obligations under the senior loan facility 
the senior loan facility has numerous restrictive covenants which require the company to maintain minimum levels of interest coverage and fixed charge coverage and which also restrict the company s ability to pay dividends and make capital expenditures 
as of december the company was in compliance with all such covenants and financial ratio requirements 
the senior loan facility matures on december the company believes it has adequate availability of capital from operations and its borrowings under the senior loan facility to fund present operations and anticipated growth including expansion in its existing and targeted market areas 
the company continually evaluates potential acquisitions and has held discussions with a number of acquisition candidates 
however the company currently has no binding agreement with respect to any acquisition candidates 
should suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing the company believes that its financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally the company may issue common or preferred stock which may be issued to third parties or to sellers of acquired businesses 
share repurchase program since october the company has purchased shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
an additional million remains authorized for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the terms of the hughes note limit the company s ability to repurchase shares of its common stock prior to the maturity date of november the hughes note does permit the company to purchase up to million of its common stock subject to certain limitations 
intangible assets at december the company had net intangible assets of million representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 
the net goodwill balance at december includes million of net goodwill that arose at the time the company was established in in a leveraged buyout transaction 
the remaining goodwill has arisen in connection with the company s subsequent acquisitions 
in addition to goodwill loan financing fees are being amortized over the term of the related debt and three non compete agreements are being amortized over the respective contractual terms 
goodwill is amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in assigning such amortization periods the company considered the following factors i projected future cash flows of the acquired business  ii effects of obsolescence demand competition and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life  and iii the expected actions of competitors and others that may restrict present competitive advantages 
management periodically assesses the recoverability of goodwill and considers whether the goodwill should be completely or partially written off or the amortization period accelerated 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the policy for evaluating goodwill for impairment 
at december management determined that there was no persuasive evidence that any material portion of goodwill will dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization periods used

the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below

the fair value of the company s revolving loan and term loan is not affected by changes in market interest rates 
foreign exchange risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the united kingdom and france for which the functional currencies are the british pound and the french franc respectively 
historically the company has not hedged its foreign currency exposure and fluctuations in british pound us dollar and french franc us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound and french franc may positively or negatively impact the company s revenues operating expenses and earnings 
however due to the size of its operations in the united kingdom and france the company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in cautionary statement for purpose of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of statements contained in this report regarding future periods which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to factors related to i the sensitivity of the swimming pool supply business to weather conditions  ii the intense competition and low barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply industry  iii the sensitivity of the swimming pool supply business to general economic conditions  iv the company s ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses  v the company s ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms  vi the risk of fire safety and casualty losses and related claims of liability inherent in the storage of chemicals sold by the company  and vii the company s ability to remain in compliance with the numerous environmental health and safety requirements to which it is subject 
such factors could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from the company s expectations described above 
the company s stockholders should also be aware that while the company does at various times communicate with securities analysts it is against the company s policies to disclose to such analysts any material non public information or other confidential information
