corporate interest income was  consisting primarily of interest on loans to related parties see note to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate interest expense was  consisting primarily of the interest charges on senior bank debt 
the company s senior bank debt lender is bank of america  na bofa  note to consolidated financial statements of the company includes information regarding the terms of the senior bank debt 
during  the company recorded a consolidated tax benefit of  consisting of a current tax provision on pre tax earnings  offset by a net tax benefit generated by an intercompany transfer of assets and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
in december elxsi transferred the assets of the restaurant division  in a taxable transaction  to a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary 
the transfer of the restaurant division was structured to put in place a more efficient corporate structure  allowing the company to more easily raise capital  thereby reducing interest carrying charges  and potentially increase the overall valuation of the elxsi assets 
because the newly formed subsidiary has an ultimate ownership structure identical to that of the restaurant division prior to the transfer and the transfer occurred between entities under common control  there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements other than the tax related impacts discussed herein 
for tax purposes  the gain on the transfer of these assets created a current state tax liability of  and a federal alternative minimum tax liability of  which are reflected in the current tax provision 
for federal income tax purposes  the gain was offset with net operating loss carryforwards  creating a deferred tax benefit of  in accordance with fax   has been reflected as a prepaid asset to reflect the federal and state tax impacts of inter company profits related to this transaction 
management evaluates the likelihood of future earnings during the remaining life of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the anticipated realization of these tax loss carryforwards in determining the amount of the deferred tax asset to record 
taking into account reasonable and prudent tax planning strategies and future income projections  the net deferred tax asset of  represents the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that management believes more likely than not will be realized over their remaining lives 
the remaining valuation allowance is necessary due to the magnitude of the net operating loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of future income estimates 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income would affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the utilization of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or reduced under certain circumstances 
events which may affect these carryforwards include  but are not limited to  cumulative stock ownership changes of or more over a three year period  as defined  the ability of the company to realize budgeted future taxable income  and the timing of the utilization of the tax benefit carryforwards 
such changes in ownership would significantly restrict the company s ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards under sections and of the internal revenue code irc 
management recognizes that it is limited in its ability to prevent such cumulative changes in ownership from occurring 
if a change of ownership were to occur and no assurance can be given that one will not occur factors such as the number of common shares issued and outstanding  the market price of such shares  and short term treasury rates would be used under the current tax laws to determine the amount of the tax loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized each year
