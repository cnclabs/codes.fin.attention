we utilize what are considered simple instruments  such as forward foreign exchange contracts and non leveraged interest rate swaps  to accomplish our objectives

recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issue d statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this new standard  when in effect  will supersede sfas statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of  providing one accounting model for the review of asset impairment 
statement no 
retains much of the recognition and measurement provisions of statement no 
 but removes goodwill from its scope 
it also requires long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale to be considered as held and used until disposed of  requiring the depreciable life to be adjusted as an accounting change 
criteria to classify long lived assets to be disposed of by sale has changed from sfas statement no 
 but these costs will continue to be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  and will cease to be depreciated 
statement will also supercede the section of the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which prescribes reporting for the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement retains the basic presentation provisions of the opinion  but requires losses on a disposal or discontinued operation to be recognized as incurred 
it also broadens the definition of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the objective of this statement is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets by requiring the fair value of a liability for the asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recognized  the asset retirement costs should also be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for pre acquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
this statement requires accounting for all business combinations using the purchase method  and changes the criteria for recognizin g intangible assets apart from goodwill 
this statement is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and as such  the company s july acquisition of certain borden brands was accounted for in accordance with this statement 
statement no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets and addresses how purchased intangibles should be accounted for upon acquisition 
the statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
upon adoption of this statement october   intangibles acquired as a part of the mueller s transaction will be deemed to have an indefinite life and amortization will no longer be incurred 
the borden intangibles  consisting of trademarks and brand names are also deeme d to have an indefinite life 
all intangibles will be subject to periodic impairment testing and will be adjusted to fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is not expected to have a material impact 
other matters none 
effect of inflation during the last three fiscal periods  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
we have experienced increases in our cost of borrowing and raw materials  though generally not related to inflation 
in general  we have increased the majority of customer sales prices to recover significant raw material cost increases 
however  these changes in prices have historically lagged price increases in our raw material costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk associated with financial instruments relates to interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currency 
we occasionally utilize simple derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
we had various fixed interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million outstanding at september  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of  is the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at september  if interest rates for our long term debt under our credit facility had averaged more and the full amount available under our credit facility had been outstanding for the entire year  our interest expense would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million for the year ended september  we hedge our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries wit h euro borrowings under our credit facility 
changes in the us dollar equivalen t of euro based borrowings is recorded as a component of the net translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity 
the functional currency for our italy operation is the euro 
at september   long term debt includes obligations of million euros million under a credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate based upon the euribor rate
