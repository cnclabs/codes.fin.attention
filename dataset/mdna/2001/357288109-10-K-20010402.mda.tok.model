item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fremont general corporation fremont or the company is a financial services holding company 
fremont manages its business through two operating segments i financial services and ii property and casualty insurance 
fremont s financial services segment is consolidated within fremont general credit corporation  which is engaged in collateralized commercial and consumer lending nationwide through its california chartered industrial bank subsidiary  fremont investment loan fil 
fremont s property and casualty insurance segment is consolidated within fremont compensation insurance group fcig and substantially all of its insurance operation is represented by the underwriting of workers compensation insurance policies 
each segment is managed separately and uses different pricing  distribution and operating methods 
additionally  there are certain corporate revenues and expenses  comprised primarily of investment income  interest expense and certain general and administrative expenses  that fremont does not allocate to its segments 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item and the business section presented under item results of operations the following table presents a summary of the company s income loss before taxes by business segment and net after tax income loss for the years ended december   and year ended december  thousands of dollars income loss before taxes financial services    property and casualty    unallocated corporate interest and other expenses    total income loss before taxes    income tax expense benefit    net income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations  net of tax  extraordinary gains on extinguishment of debt  net of tax  net income loss    the substantial property and casualty segment loss before taxes for the year ended december  is predominantly the result of the recognition of an increase of million in the company s gross liability for loss and lae reserves during the quarter ended june   and the recognition of million in certain charges during the quarter ended december  associated with the company s restructuring of its workers compensation insurance operation  which was announced by the company on december  the increase in the company s gross loss and lae reserves was related primarily to claims under workers compensation insurance policies effective in or prior to additionally  during the quarter ended december   the company recognized million in various non recurring charges  primarily in the elimination of previously recorded tabular discounts in the company s loss reserves and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for premiums receivable and agents balances 
the aforementioned increase in gross loss and lae reserves  restructuring charges and additional non recurring charges  are explained in more detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements and in the property and casualty insurance operation section herein 
as previously discussed in the business section general presented under item  the company  as a result of substantial operating losses in its property and casualty insurance segment in  has entered into an agreement with the doi which provides for additional regulatory oversight and supervision of the company s workers compensation insurance subsidiaries 
the company has restructured its workers compensation insurance operation to reduce operating expenses to levels considered appropriate for the expected significant reductions in workers compensation insurance premiums 
in addition  in an effort to mitigate the impact that the company s e under regulatory supervision rating from am best has on its ability to write new and renewal workers compensation insurance policies  the company and an insurance carrier with an a rating from am best have reached agreement on substantially all material terms of a fronting facility 
this fronting facility transaction is pending definitive documentation and final regulatory approval  and the company cannot be certain that an agreement will be finalized and implemented 
the company s property and casualty insurance operation segment s loss before taxes for the year ended december  was due primarily to the impact of two actions 
first  the company  in the third quarter of  recognized in the amount of million  the adverse effect on incurred loss and lae of a lower than expected level of certain reinsurance recoverables than had been actuarially predicted at the inception of certain reinsurance agreements 
second  the recognition of a settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december   which resulted in a charge of million 
the aforementioned two actions are explained in more detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements and in the property and casualty insurance operation section herein 
the financial services segment recorded income before taxes of million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
included in the results for is the recognition of a gain in the amount of million related to the sale of the company s commercial finance subsidiary  fremont financial  in december of fremont financial s income before taxes of million and million for and  respectively  are included in the financial services segment results reported 
the significant increase in income before taxes for  as compared to  is primarily related to an increase in the interest margin  lower operating expense ratios  and higher levels of gains on the whole loan sales of residential real estate loans 
the increase in income before taxes in  as compared to  is primarily due to a significant increase in average earning assets  with an offset due to slightly lower interest margins and a decrease in gains on the whole loan sales of residential real estate loans 
see the financial services operation section herein for additional detail 
unallocated corporate interest and other expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of investment income revenue  offset by unallocated corporate expenses consisting primarily of interest expense  net of any affiliate interest income  and general and administrative expenses  net of subsidiary reimbursement 
the unallocated corporate interest and other expense loss before taxes for the year ended december   was million as compared to and million  for and  respectively 
the significant increase in as compared to the consistent levels in and is due primarily to lower affiliate interest income from the company s downstream holding company subsidiaries 
the lower affiliate interest income resulted from the company s conversions on january  and april  of approximately million and million  respectively  in notes receivable due from these subsidiaries to common equity in the subsidiaries  thereby establishing capital contributions to them 
the january  conversion transaction affected fremont general credit corporation fgcc  the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the company s industrial bank subsidiary  fil 
the april  conversion transaction impacted fcig  which is the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the company s insurance company subsidiaries 
with these debt conversions  beginning january   and to a larger extent april   the company s unallocated corporate interest expense is  and will continue to be  higher 
after these conversions  there is no affiliate debt due from the company s downstream holding company subsidiaries

year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues financial services    property and casualty    unallocated corporate revenue    total    the company generated revenues of approximately billion for  as compared to revenues of billion and billion for and  respectively 
higher revenues in as compared to resulted from higher workers compensation insurance premiums in the property and casualty insurance segment 
revenues in the financial services segment remained relatively even in as compared to while the company s commercial real estate average loan portfolio increased from billion in to billion in  and the company experienced slightly higher yields on its average loan portfolio and investments  the company did not have any revenue from its fremont financial subsidiary in as a result of its sale in december higher workers compensation insurance premiums were achieved in primarily from increased new business development during  which increased gross estimated annual premiums in effect at december  to billion  and from a lower level of ceded reinsurance premiums 
during and  the company had lowered its reinsurance attachment point to  which resulted in higher ceded reinsurance premiums and lower net earned premium revenues during these two years 
see property and casualty insurance operation premiums 
higher revenues for as compared to resulted from increases in both financial services and property and casualty insurance revenues 
financial services revenues increased as its average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in  despite a slight decrease in yields 
see financial services operation 
revenues for the property and casualty insurance segment increased primarily due to increased new business development and the september  acquisition of unicare specialty services  inc unicare  a workers compensation insurance company  from wellpoint health networks inc during the year ended december  the company purchased million and million  respectively  in principal amount of its publicly traded series b senior notes due and series b senior notes due senior notes  which were originally issued by the company pursuant to an exchange offer in the second quarter of see liquidity and capital resources for additional detail on this extinguishment of debt 
in addition  during  the company purchased million of principal amount at maturity of its publicly traded liquid yield option notes due the lyons 
the company recognized an after tax gain of million from these actions during the after tax gain is reported as an extraordinary item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in the year ended december   the company incurred a net after tax loss of million to recognize the contribution by fremont of additional assets to its discontinued insurance operations 
the additional assets were considered necessary as the company observed an increase in reported asbestos and environmental claims in excess of previous estimates 
the company s discontinued insurance operations consist primarily of assumed treaty and facultative reinsurance business that was discontinued between and in  the company established a management group to actively manage the liquidation of this business 
the liabilities associated with this business are long term in duration and  therefore  the company continues to be subject to claims being reported 
claims under these reinsurance treaties include professional liability  product liability and general liability  which include environmental and asbestos claims

the effective tax rates for the three periods presented are different than the federal enacted tax rate of  due mainly to tax exempt investment income  which either reduces the company s taxable income or increases the company s taxable loss  higher state income tax provisions within the company s financial services operation and tax exempt goodwill amortization  which is excluded from deductible expenses 
the significant change in effective tax rates in  as compared to and  is a result of the company s write off of certain goodwill balances and other intangible assets as part of its restructuring charge in see note b of the company s consolidated financial statements for further detail on the restructuring charge recognized by the company in as the company is currently in a net loss carryover condition  the income tax benefit in the twelve months ended december  has been recognized as a deferred tax asset

increased levels of gains recognized on whole loan sales 
lower net operating expense levels as a percentage of average earning assets

offsetting this was a decline in net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets to for as compared to for in addition  in  the company sold less residential real estate loans in whole loan sales transactions due to market pricing conditions

the net yields on residential real estate loans decreased slightly 
as indicated in the table above  the average outstandings of commercial real estate loans increased by in and created a significant positive impact on the company s overall net interest income margin

at december   non performing commercial real estate loans and real estate owned represented of the total commercial real estate loans and real estate owned outstanding 
the increase is due to only a few loans being classified as non accrual and becoming real estate owned through foreclosure  for example  at december  there was no real estate owned  as compared to two real estate owned properties at december  with a balance of million 
the increase in residential real estate non performing loans was primarily attributable to increased levels of loan originations  which totaled billion in  as compared to billion in  and general trends for sub prime loans 
the syndicated loan group had no loans in non performing status at december   and only one  with a balance of million  at december  see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail of the company s non performing assets

whole loan sales are cash transactions made without recourse to the company or its subsidiaries 
the lower whole loan sales resulted from an observed decrease in the price for the company s residential real estate loans beginning in the second half of this condition was a consequence of market disruptions and an oversupply of loans available for sale which occurred during this same period 
rather than sell its loans at cash prices lower than what it believed was the economic benefit to be derived  the company began a program to retain these benefits by either retaining the loans in its portfolio or by securitizing them 
for the year ended december   the company did not recognize any gain on the residual interests retained from the three securitizations  since the value of the residual interests is subject to substantial credit  prepayment  and interest rate risks on the loans sold 
while this reduces current period income  income may be recognized in future periods if the company s original assumptions develop favorably

the combined net reserve increase for loss  alae and ulae totaling million represent primarily the and prior accident year component of the million in total loss and lae reserve increase recognized by the company in the second quarter ended june  see special discussion concerning the loss and lae reserve increases in in the company increased its net loss and lae reserves for and prior accident years by million 
the increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of a lower than expected level of reinsurance recoveries than had been actuarially predicted of incurred losses ceded under certain reinsurance contracts that were in effect from january  through december   coupled with the effect on the accident year of the company s recognition of the settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance treaty that expired december  under the settlement agreement  fcig received in excess of million in cash and no longer has any involvement with reliance under the reinsurance contract 
special discussion concerning the loss and lae reserve increases in in the second quarter of  the company increased its gross loss and lae reserves under workers compensation insurance policies effective in or prior to by million 
the company s reserve action was determined through an evaluation of several factors  including increased severity trends observed since december  relating to the and prior accident years  increased variability of actuarial indications  and increased uncertainty within the workers compensation industry as to the underlying causes and consequent ultimate impact of both increases in claim severity and an acceleration in the payment of claims 
the company further evaluated the actuarial indications as of june  to determine what impact  if any  such indications would have on the company s recognition of incurred loss and lae in the second half of after excluding the previously discussed non recurring items from the fourth quarter results  the loss ratios recognized by the company in the third and fourth quarters of were and  respectively 
the adequacy of these provisions for loss and lae incurred for the accident year were evaluated by the company  taking into consideration the actuarial indications as of december   the severity development potential for reinsurance recoveries  assumptions regarding changes in the development pattern of claims incurred on the accident year  as well as other factors 
based on these considerations  the company believes that adequate provisions have been made for the ultimate settlement costs of claims incurred in calendar year with respect to prior accident years  the company evaluated the actuarial indications as of december   as well as various internal and external factors  to determine the adequacy of the loss and lae reserves associated with these accident years 
on a net of reinsurance basis and excluding the commutation with reliance  the company observed that with regard to accident years prior to  favorable development had emerged since june  in particular  the emergence of favorable development in ultimate settlement costs estimates on the combined accident years and prior more than offset additional unfavorable development on the accident year 
additionally  this observed unfavorable development on the accident year since june  represents an reduction in such development as compared to the development observed on the accident year for the period from december  through june  this decrease in unfavorable development on the accident year in the second half of is considered by the company as an indication of greater stability in the actuarial indications of ultimate settlement costs for the accident year as it matures over time 
see risk factors 
with respect to the million total loss and lae reserve increase in the second quarter of  million relates to loss and directly alae  with the remaining reserve increase of million relating to that portion of the company s gross lae reserves that provide for the general and administrative costs of settling estimated claims and which are not allocated to specific claims  or ulae 
contributing to the company s determination to increase its loss and alae reserves was an observed increase in the gross claim severity trend primarily related to the accident year and to a lesser extent  and prior accident years 
at december   the company had observed relative stability in its gross loss and alae indications  particularly with regard to accident years prior to  as compared to its observations of reinsurance recoveries 
during the six months ended december   the company had recorded significant reductions in its original estimates of reinsurance recoveries 
see special discussion concerning reinsurance transactions and reserve adjustments recognized in following 
during the six months ended june   the company observed that the gross severity trend for the accident year was both higher than that observed for the accident year  and was emerging at levels higher than what was expected to emerge using the actuarial indications at december  during this same period but to a lesser extent than during  the company observed that the accident year was also emerging at levels higher than what was actuarially predicted at december  another contributing factor to the company s gross loss and alae reserve actions in the second quarter of was increased variability observed among the actuarial methods evaluated by the company at june  in addition to the actuarial indications developed by the company s actuaries  the company reviewed actuarial indications from various other actuaries and observed variability among the actuarial methods employed and the results derived 
other than as specifically articulated by the actuary  the company is not able to determine with certainty the specific cause or causes of the observed variability of actuarial indications and has reached its own conclusions based on a review of its internal data base and a subjective evaluation of both internal and external factors 
the company also observed that the workers compensation industry  particularly in california  has experienced significant increases in claim severity on the accident year and to a lesser extent the accident year 
these severity increases covered both medical and indemnity costs and were above levels adjusted for estimated inflation 
the frequency of claims  however  has remained stable to slightly lower 
the increasing severity on the accident year  coupled with a continuing industry wide acceleration in paid losses observed by the company over the past several years  has resulted in significant increases in the projections of total industry wide losses and alae 
while certain factors have been cited as reasons for the industry wide severity increases and paid loss acceleration  conclusive evidence has not been identified by the company to either support or refute these findings 
in addition to the previously discussed gross loss and alae reserve increase  the company strengthened its ulae reserves by million in the second quarter of similar to the company s observations concerning its gross loss and alae reserves  the company observed increased variability among actuarial indications of its ulae reserves 
the company determined its reserve action after reviewing several actuarial indications  as well as a review of both internal data and available industry information related to claim administration costs 
effective for workers compensation insurance policies incepting january  and after  and until april   the company s reinsurance limits were significantly reduced through the expiration at december  of certain low level reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance attachment point was increased from  per loss occurrence prior to january  to million per loss occurrence on january  and after 
effective april   the company purchased additional reinsurance that lowered the attachment point to  per loss occurrence 
the company anticipates that these changes in the company s reinsurance program at january  and april  will have the net effect of lowering the total amount of reinsurance recoveries for calendar year as compared to calendar year lower amounts of reinsurance recoveries have been recognized in as compared to special discussion concerning reinsurance transactions and reserve adjustments recognized in for the year ended december   the company s property and casualty insurance operation recorded a loss before taxes from continuing operations of million 
this loss resulted primarily from the combined adverse effect on incurred loss and lae of a lower than expected level of reinsurance recoverables than had been actuarially predicted at inception  coupled with the company s recognition of the settlement agreement with reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  with regard to the lower than expected reinsurance recoverables  which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of  the company lowered its estimate of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses for the and accident years by approximately million 
this decrease was in recognition of a lower than actuarially predicted level of incurred losses ceded under certain reinsurance contracts that were in effect from january  through december  these reinsurance contracts reduced the company s net loss exposure from a historical retention of million per loss occurrence to  per loss occurrence 
during the third quarter of  and pursuant to its regular review of net incurred loss and lae estimates  the company observed a deterioration in these net loss and lae estimates as compared to the actuarial predictions 
to assist the company in its determination of net loss and lae reserve estimates  the company retained independent actuarial consultants who performed an actuarial analysis of the company s net loss and lae reserves as of june  these actuarial indications were further re evaluated by independent outside actuaries at december   which resulted in the company s recognition of the deterioration in reinsurance recoverables in the third and fourth quarters of see risk factors 
also contributing to the company s loss before taxes in the fourth quarter of was the recognition of million in lower reinsurance recoverables on the and accident years pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into on february  between the company and reliance under a reinsurance contract that was in effect from january  through december  under the settlement agreement  the company received approximately million in cash and no longer has any involvement with the reliance workers compensation reinsurance programs brokered for reliance by unicover managers  inc the million decrease in reinsurance recoverables represents primarily the adjustment necessary to bring the estimated reinsurance recoverables relating to the and accident years under the reinsurance contract with reliance to a present value basis at december  premiums insurance premiums earned from the company s property and casualty insurance operations was billion for the year  as compared to million in the increase in premiums in were due primarily to the combined effects of i an expansion in the company s premium base through new business development in  ii premium rate increases which the company began implementing during the second half of and accelerated during  iii lower reinsurance costs beginning january   and iv additional premiums earned in the second quarter of under certain expired retrospectively rated workers compensation insurance policies 
using estimated annual premiums on policies in effect at december  and referred to as inforce premiums  the company s gross inforce premiums have decreased to million at december  from billion at december  gross inforce premiums have steadily declined during as a consequence of ratings downgrades  the company s efforts to bring premium levels in line with levels of statutory surplus in its workers compensation insurance subsidiaries  and the restructuring of the workers compensation insurance operation in december of on march   am best downgraded fcig from a excellent to b very good citing concerns regarding fcig s loss reserve adequacy and the state of the workers compensation market in california 
a b rating is still within am best s secure range 
on august   am best downgraded fcig from b very good to b fair citing further concerns regarding the state of the workers compensation market in california 
a b rating is a vulnerable rating per am best s guidelines 
as previously discussed  the company entered an agreement with the doi on november  which provided for additional regulatory oversight and supervision  as well as limiting the amount of new and renewal workers compensation insurance premiums that fcig could underwrite 
due to this regulatory supervision  am best downgraded fcig s rating to e under regulatory supervision on december  an e rating severely limits fcig s ability to underwrite new and renewal workers compensation insurance policies 
to mitigate the e rating s impact  see the previous discussion on the company s efforts to finalize a fronting facility with an a rated insurance carrier 
during  the company achieved premium rate increases across all of its national geographic regions 
on a weighted average basis  these increases averaged on a nationwide basis  and in california 
these premium rate increases are a continuation of efforts by the company  which began in the second half of  to further strengthen its premium rate levels 
the company s commitment to strengthening its premium rate levels  among other things  has also resulted in a reduction in its renewal business which contributed to further reductions in the company s gross inforce premiums 
beginning january  the company s reinsurance costs  which are classified as a reduction to net premiums earned  were reduced significantly due to the december  expiration of certain low level reinsurance contracts that had incepted january  in addition  during the second quarter of  the company recorded approximately million in additional premiums under certain expired retrospectively rated workers compensation insurance policies as a result of additional loss experience under these insurance policies 
typically  the terms of retrospectively rated insurance policies provide for additional premiums when loss experience under the insurance policy reaches certain levels as specified within the policy 
usually the extent of any additional premiums is subject to a maximum limit as specified within the policy 
policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses to insurance premiums is referred to as the expense ratio 
the company s expense ratio was and for the years and  respectively 
the year s expense ratio  however  included that was related to the company s restructuring charge recognized during the fourth quarter of removing the from the expense ratio results in a revised ratio of  which is identical to s ratio 
the expense ratio for the fourth quarter of was  excluding the effect of the restructuring charge  as compared to for the fourth quarter of this increase in the expense ratio was due in part to higher earned premiums during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  but was also due to the effect of premiums earned reducing faster than expenses were reduced 
as stated previously  the company expects that its workers compensation premium writings will be significantly reduced in the foreseeable future 
while policy acquisition costs are expected to vary directly with the intended premium decreases  other operating costs and expenses  however  do not typically vary directly with the premium level changes 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to continue to reduce expenses at the same rate as its premium base decreases and thereby prevent the expense ratio from increasing in the future 
dividends to policyholders the company s policyholder dividend ratio was and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the policyholder dividend ratio in and  as compared to is due to the company s expansion in various states in which participating policies are more frequent 
participating policies obligate the company to consider the payment of dividends to its policyholders 
although the substantial majority of the company s workers compensation insurance policies within its primary regions are written as non participating and thereby do not obligate the company to consider the payment of dividends  the company does write participating business in other states 
the majority of the company s participating insurance policies were written in its midwest and eastern regions 
net investment income net investment income within the property and casualty insurance operation was million and million for and  respectively 
lower investment income in was due primarily to lower amounts of average invested assets in  and to a lesser degree  lower yields  as compared to the lower average invested assets resulted primarily from higher ceded reinsurance costs in and claim payments 
also  during the third and fourth quarters of  the company increased the proportionate share of short term investments in its workers compensation insurance investment portfolio 
this was done to provide additional liquidity for the company as it contemplated various options  such as the purchase of adverse loss development reinsurance policies  to increase the statutory surplus of its workers compensation insurance subsidiaries 
the company did not enter into adverse loss development reinsurance agreements  but rather entered in an agreement with the doi that provided the company s workers compensation insurance subsidiaries with the permitted practice of discounting its loss and lae reserves 
by increasing the short term investments component of its workers compensation insurance investment portfolio the yields realized by the company decreased 
as of december   the company s workers compensation insurance subsidiaries investment portfolio  at amortized cost  totaled billion  as compared to billion at december  see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on the company s investment portfolio 
market risk the company is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
changes in interest rates will affect the company s net investment income  loan interest  interest expense and total stockholders equity 
the objective of fremont s asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest and investment income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
the company has designated its entire investment portfolio as investments that would be available for sale in response to changing market conditions  liquidity requirements  interest rate movements and other investment factors 
see notes a and c to consolidated financial statements 
fremont currently owns no derivative financial instru ments and  consequently  is not subject to market risk for such off balance sheet financial instruments 
furthermore  the company does not have exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
financial services operation interest rate risk fremont s financial services operation is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans receivable and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance its loans such as industrial bank deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in fremont s financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations to the company 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  the company does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives 
for the financial services operation  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity 
the following table provides information about the assets and liabilities of the company s financial services operation that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

during  the company securitized certain of its residential real estate loans 
a securitization has the effect of reducing interest rate risk since the securitized loans are typically removed from the balance sheet 
however  the company retains a residual interest in the securitized loans  and this residual interest is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value million at december  
residual interests do not have a stated maturity or amortization period and the expected amount of the net cash flow  as well as the timing of such cash flow  depends on the performance of the underlying collateral supporting each securitization 
the actual cash flow of these instruments could vary substantially if performance is different from the company s assumptions 
fremont develops assumptions to value its residual interests by analyzing past portfolio performance  current loan characteristics and current market and interest rate conditions 
property and casualty insurance operation interest rate risk the property and casualty insurance operation has exposure to changes in long term interest rates due mainly to its significant investment in the available for sale investment portfolio 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the fair value of the fixed rate investments resulting in fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses on investments  which also affects the company s stockholders equity 
generally  for an investment in a fixed rate bond  a rise in market interest rates for bonds with a similar remaining term and face amount will result in a decline in the fair value of the fixed rate bond 
the converse situation applies as well
