potential harm to the company caused by a decrease in it spending the company s business depends on continued spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it 
the company believes that  concurrently with the recent economic slowdown in the us and abroad  there has been a decrease in it spending and the it spending projections of substantial commercial and governmental users of it 
if as a result of general economic uncertainty or otherwise it users reduce it spending levels  such a decrease in spending would likely substantially reduce demand for the company s products and services  substantially harm the company s business  and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results and condition 
management of growth since inception  the company s operations have changed substantially due to the expansion and growth of the company s business 
growth places significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational and financial resources and systems 
the company s ability to manage growth  should it continue to occur  will require the company to continue to improve its systems and to motivate and effectively manage an evolving workforce 
during the company continued its investments in management information systems 
integration and implementation problems encountered during the company s systems upgrades  however  contributed to the company s significant decrease in collections of outstanding accounts receivable during the year ended december  there can be no assurance that the company s collections of outstanding accounts receivable will improve 
if the company s management is unable to effectively manage a changing and growing business and continue to improve its systems  the quality of the company s services and products  its retention of key employees  its results of operations  and its financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s dependence on renewals of subscription based services the company derived approximately of its total revenues in from subscriptions to the company s advisory services 
in the year ended december   the company derived approximately of its total revenues from subscriptions to its advisory services 
the company may not be successful in maintaining its subscription renewal rates 
commencing in and continuing into  the company experienced a shift in client demand toward more consultative  solution oriented products and services 
with the advent of the internet  information alone without analysis in the context of a client s environment has less value 
in addition  the company s ability to renew subscriptions is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality  and timely analysis and advice to its clients the company may not be able to hire and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients the company may not be able to deliver products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition if the company is unable to successfully maintain its subscription renewal rates or sustain the necessary level of performance  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the company s dependence on non recurring strategic consulting engagements the company derived approximately and of its total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively  from strategic consulting engagements 
strategic consulting engagements vary in number  size  and scope  and typically are project based and non recurring 
the company s ability to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality  and timely consulting services to its clients the company may not be able to hire and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market the company may not be able to develop new business the company may not be able to maintain the costs of engagements despite a fixed fee cost structure the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients the skills and competencies of the company s strategic consulting staff may not match the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential strategic consulting engagements the company may not be able to deliver consulting services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition if the company is not able to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the company s expectation of fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company expects future operating results to fluctuate due to several factors  many of which are not in the company s control the disproportionately large percentage of the company s advisory services subscriptions that expire in the fourth quarter of each year the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to the company s advisory services the mix of advisory services revenues versus strategic consulting and published research products revenues the number  size  and scope of strategic consulting engagements in which the company is engaged  the degree of completion of such engagements and the ability of the company to match the skills of its consulting staff to consulting engagement opportunities the timing and amount of new business generated by the company the mix of domestic versus international business the timing of the development  introduction  and marketing of new products and services the timing of the hiring of research analysts  consultants  and sales representatives employee utilization rates and the accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing strategic consulting engagements changes in the spending patterns of the company s clients the company s ability to collect its accounts receivable changes in market demand for it research and analysis decreases in spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it general economic uncertainty and economic slowdown in the us and abroad competitive conditions in the industry due to these factors  the company believes period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future operating results 
the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  such as during the quarters ended september   and december   which will likely have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks associated with international operations net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately of the company s total advisory services revenues for the year ended december   and approximately of the company s total advisory services revenues for the year ended december  the company sells its products internationally through a network of independent sales representative organizations and wholly owned subsidiaries 
the risks to the company of international operations include greater accounts receivable collection risk with respect to sales through its independent sales representative organizations because the company relies on the sales representative organization to invoice and collect receivables longer accounts receivable collection cycles the financial health of individual sales representative organizations developing and managing relationships with sales representative organizations and foreign employees integration of acquired international operations into the company s existing operations greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact with respect to sales through its independent sales representative organizations political  social  and economic conditions in various jurisdictions tariffs and other trade barriers potentially adverse tax consequences the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories may require considerable management and financial resources  as was the case in  and may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
risks of failing to anticipate changing market needs the company s success depends in part on its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its products and services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
commencing in and continuing into  the company experienced a shift in client demand toward more consultative  solution oriented products and services 
with the advent of the internet  information alone without analysis in the context of a client s environment has less value 
in addition to this  frequent and often dramatic changes characterize the it industry  including the following introduction of new products and obsolescence of others shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors volatility in spending levels on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
the company commits substantial resources to meeting these challenges 
if the company fails to provide insightful timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs  such a failure could have a material and adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
the company s dependence on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the company needs to hire  train  and retain a significant number of qualified employees to execute its strategy and support its growth 
in particular  the company needs trained research analysts  consultants  sales representatives  product development  management and operations staff 
the company continues to experience intense competition in recruiting and retaining qualified employees 
furthermore  the company s ability to manage its business effectively will require it to further develop the management skills of its managers and supervisors and to train  motivate and manage its employees 
the pool of experienced candidates  particularly the pool of experienced managers  is small  and the company competes for qualified employees against many companies  including gartner group  that have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
if the company is unable to successfully hire  retain  and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
competition the it research  analysis  and consulting industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
the company s principal direct competitor  gartner group  has a substantially longer operating history and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than the company 
the company also competes indirectly with larger electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
the company s indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering  and marketing resources than the company  could choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
the company s market has few barriers to entry 
new competitors could easily compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s advisory services or strategic consulting services 
the company s current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more effective than the company s products and services 
competitors may also produce their products and services at less cost and market them more effectively 
if the company is unable to successfully compete against existing or new competitors  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and would likely result in pricing pressure and loss of market share 
risks associated with new product and services development the company s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business sectors  changes in client requirements  and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching  and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service is inherently risky and costly 
assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service is also risky and costly 
commencing in and continuing into  the company experienced a shift in client demand toward more consultative  solution oriented products and services 
with the advent of the internet  information alone without analysis in the context of a client s environment has less value 
in addition to this  the company has introduced relatively few new products or services and has had limited experience in managing strategic investments 
if the company is unable to develop new products and services  such inabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with strategic investments in an effort to develop new products and services  from april to december  the company made investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic businesses totaling approximately million 
such strategic investments and advances are highly risky and generally illiquid 
furthermore  strategic investments may disrupt the ongoing business of the company and distract management 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million impairment loss for the full carrying value of two of its strategic investments 
there can be no assurance that such strategic investments will result in new product or service offerings for the company or otherwise be successful 
many factors outside the control of the company  including general economic conditions  could impair the value of the company s strategic investments  requiring the company to record further  substantial losses related to such investments 
the company is searching for potential purchasers for certain of its strategic investments 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to liquidate its strategic investments when needed or desired 
if the company is unable to manage or liquidate its strategic investments  such inabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s dependence on key personnel the company relies  and will continue to rely  in large part on its key management  research  consulting  sales  product development  and operations personnel 
the company s success partially depends on its ability to motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
if dale kutnick chairman  chief executive officer  and co research director and or other senior officers leave the company  such loss or losses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risk of product services pricing limiting potential market the company s pricing strategy may limit the potential market for the company s advisory services and strategic consulting services to substantial commercial and governmental users and vendors of it 
as a result  the company may be required to reduce prices for its advisory services and strategic consulting services or to introduce new products and services with lower prices to expand or maintain its market share 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risk of failure to integrate recent acquisitions and risks associated with potential acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company buys  or makes investments in  complementary businesses  products  and services 
if the company finds a business it wishes to acquire  the company could have difficulty negotiating the terms of the purchase  financing the purchase  and assimilating the employees  products  and operations of the acquired business 
acquisitions may disrupt the ongoing business of the company and distract management 
furthermore  acquisition of new businesses may not lead to the successful development of new products or services  or if developed  such products or services may not achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable 
a given acquisition may also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company may be required to pay cash  incur debt or issue equity to pay for any future acquisitions or contingent payments in connection with previously consummated acquisitions  which may be dilutive to the company s current stockholders and or decrease the company s working capital 
risks associated with restrictive covenants the credit facility with its bank the facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or other distributions  dispose of certain assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  make certain investments  acquisitions or mergers  and that otherwise restrict corporate activities 
in addition  under the facility  the company is required to maintain specified financial covenants  including minimal levels of ebitda  minimum leverage ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios 
the ability of the company to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond its control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the facility 
in the event of any such default  the lender could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the facility  together with all accrued interest  to be due and payable 
any such election would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the volatility and unpredictability of the company s stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to decreases 
during  as reported on the nasdaq national market  the company s common stock quotations ranged from a high of to a low of 
on march   the market price of the company s common stock was 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the company s perceived prospects  including anticipated revenue growth variations in the company s operating results and the company s achievement of key business targets the company s ability to maintain operating expenses below revenue levels or improve collection of its accounts receivable changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates differences between the company s reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  such as during the quarters ended september  and december  announcements of new service offerings by the company or its competitors market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures  or strategic investments announced by the company or its competitors general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to the company s operating performance in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if the company were sued in a securities class action  it would result in substantial costs as well as a diversion of management s attention and resources  and it would likely cause the market price of the company s common stock to fall
