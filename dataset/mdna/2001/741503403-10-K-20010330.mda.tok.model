item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  including the notes to those statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and the lead in immediately preceding part i of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in more detail in the lead in immediately preceding part i of this annual report on form k  this discussion contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause those differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results 
overview we have pioneered a unique e commerce pricing system known as a demand collection system that enables consumers to use the internet to save money on a wide range of products and services while enabling sellers to generate incremental revenue 
using a simple and compelling consumer proposition name your own price sm we collect consumer demand  in the form of individual customer offers  for a particular product or service at a price set by the customer 
we then communicate that demand directly to participating sellers or access a proprietary database of inventory available to us for purchase and  based upon the customer s offer price  elect whether or not to accept that customer s offer 
consumers agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time and  once fulfilled  offers generally cannot be canceled 
we benefit consumers by enabling them to save money  while at the same time benefiting sellers by providing them with an effective revenue management tool capable of identifying and capturing incremental revenues 
by requiring consumers to be flexible with respect to brands  sellers and product features  we enable sellers to generate incremental revenue without disrupting their existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures 
our business model and brand are currently  through us or independent licensees  supporting several products and service offerings  including the following o leisure airline tickets  provided by domestic and international airline participants  and travel insurance  o hotel rooms  in substantially all major united states markets with more than national hotel chains as participants  o rental cars  in substantially all major united states airport markets with five leading rental car chains as participants  o new automobiles  in substantially all major united states markets  o home financing services  in substantially all major united states markets  which includes home mortgage services  home equity loans and refinancing services  and o long distance telephone calling  provided by three carriers  in substantially all united states markets 
in certain instances  we have licensed the priceline 
com name and demand collection system to third parties to offer a particular product or service home financing or to offer a number of products or services in a distinct international region europe and asia 
pursuant to these licensee transactions  we generally receive a royalty under the license and may also receive fees for services and reimbursement of certain expenses 
we also hold convertible securities or warrants entitling us to acquire a significant percentage of such licensee s equity securities upon the occurrence of certain events 
during the second half of  we experienced a decrease in the momentum of our business as the result of a number of events  including the closing of the groceries and gas business of webhouse club  inc  one of our licensees  negative news stories related primarily to customer service issues and the decline in our stock price 
while our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year have  as a general matter  increased  our results of operations for the fourth quarter were  as a general matter  significantly lower than our results of operations in the third quarter in particular  new customer offers grew  year over year  as we added approximately million new customers in compared to million in  but decreased approximately in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter similarly  repeat customer offers declined approximately quarter over quarter 
these declines are representative of the general slowing of our business in the fourth quarter we believe this decline is attributable to the decrease in the momentum of our business described above and the general seasonal decline in our travel operations in the fourth quarter 
we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to achieve profitability  primarily from our travel business  and to continue to promote the priceline 
com brand 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion  technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results 
our goal is to reduce operating losses and improve gross margins in an effort to achieve profitability 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult  and accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain revenue growth or profitability

during the fourth quarter  we eliminated adaptive marketing revenues  which were historically accretive to our travel revenues and gross margins  but which we now believe negatively impacted customer satisfaction 
seasonal variations in our travel business  where the third and fourth quarters are typically weaker than the first two quarters  have historically and are expected to continue to impact our travel revenues 
travel products  particularly airline tickets  continue to account for the majority of our revenue

during  gross profit was positive as a result of the transactional sales volumes that were sold at positive margins  and the launch of products generating fee based revenues 
because fee based and ancillary revenues generally do not involve separate costs  these revenues had a disproportionately positive impact on total gross profit and made a substantial contribution to gross profit for the year ended december  for the year ended december   gross margin increased each quarter as a result of increased sales volume  increased fee based revenue and decreased sales of tickets that were sold below cost

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb no 

the statement defers for one year the effective date of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the rule now will apply to fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
the statement will require the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of the provisions of sfas no 
without reconsideration
