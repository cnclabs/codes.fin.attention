our core mailing and shipping services are designed to allow individual consumers or employees of small businesses or larger enterprises to select a carrier  print us postage or shipping labels from multiple carriers  schedule a pick up  track a package and apply enterprise wide business rules to manage and account for mailing and shipping costs 
with all of our services  no additional hardware is required  a customer can access our services through an existing internet connection and print postage or shipping labels with ordinary laser or inkjet printers 
in october  we implemented a new business strategy in an effort to more rapidly decrease our operating losses and enhance our ability to achieve profitability 
this strategy involved an initial restructuring to focus on our core business of internet postage and shipping  that reduced our total number of employees by approximately to employees  which included full time  part time and contract employees 
we took a one time charge in the fourth quarter of of million that consists primarily of employee severance  reserves established for exiting contractual arrangements and fixed asset write offs 
we also announced other cost cutting programs  including a significant reduction and redeployment of our sales and marketing expenses to those programs that have demonstrated higher returns on investment 
we combined our enterprise and e commerce business units to reduce duplication of costs and effort 
additionally  as a result of our new focus  we exited some of our longer term fixed price marketing deals in favor of variable cost marketing deals  and restructured our customer support service 
in october  we experienced a significant change in personnel at the senior management level including the resignation of our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  our president and chief operating officer  our chief financial officer  our chief marketing officer and our controller 
the board appointed bruce coleman as interim chief executive officer and as a director  kenneth mcbride as acting chief financial officer and marvin runyon as our new chairman of the board 
we cannot predict how these changes in management will affect our business 
however  if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals for these senior management positions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if our new business strategy is not successful  we will not achieve profitability as currently planned  if at all 
in february  in an effort to more rapidly decrease our operating losses  and continue with our new business strategy  we reduced the total number of employees by approximately an additional to employees  which included full time  part time and contract employees 
we expect to take a one time charge in the first quarter of related to this reduction in workforce 
we also continued our focus on exiting fixed price marketing deals  and entering into variable cost marketing deals 
for instance  in february  we terminated our marketing agreement with america online  inc which we expect to result in savings to our company of approximately million over the next two years 
additionally  we restructured our customer support service for greater efficiency

we expect to continue to experience changes in personnel at the senior management and board level as part of our restructuring process

in february  we invested million and granted encryptix a license to our technology in those three specific fields of use 
encryptix raised approximately million in private financing 
on march   encryptix ceased operations and effected a general assignment of its assets for the benefit of its creditors 
encryptix took this action due to the inability to secure additional funding 
we do not expect to be impacted by any of encryptix s resulting liabilities 
additionally  we terminated our license agreement with encryptix and maintain limited licenses to various encryptix intellectual property 
on march   we completed the acquisition of iship 
com  inc pursuant to which iship

com  inc capital stock and reserved an additional million shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of iship 
com  inc options and warrants we assumed in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
in connection with the iship 
com  inc acquisition  we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangibles  the amortization of which will significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
as of december   the un amortized intangibles related to the iship 
com  inc acquisition is million 
on march   united parcel service and mail boxes etc 
usa  inc jointly announced that united parcel service would acquire mail boxes etc

mail boxes etc 
usa  inc was also a significant customer of united parcel service 
united parcel service has informed us that it is unlikely to have mail boxes etc 
usa  inc continue to use our online shipping services in the future 
in light of the march  events  we may be required to record an appropriate reduction to the remaining goodwill in the first quarter of on august   draftworldwide  inc  which formerly served as one of our advertising and promotions agencies  filed a suit against us for alleged breach of contract in the circuit court of cook county  illinois 
the suit alleged that we improperly terminated our contract with draftworldwide and sought damages of approximately million plus interest and costs associated with the lawsuit 
we denied the allegations contained in the complaint  and filed our own counterclaim  alleging that draftworldwide had breached the contract by failing to adequately perform under the contract and had acted in bad faith in negotiating an adjustment to the terms of the contract  as provided for in the contract 
the parties recently reached a mutually acceptable resolution of the suit which will result in both parties dismissal  with prejudice  of their respective claims against each other in the very near future 
internet postage services we offer an internet postage service targeted at consumers and small businesses with less than employees 
service fee revenues for our internet postage service are generated from the two service plans that we are currently offering to our users  the simple plan and the power plan

prior to november  there was a monthly minimum fee of and a monthly maximum fee of under the simple plan 
beginning in november  the monthly minimum fee was increased to for new customers and the monthly maximum fee was discontinued 
all customers who existed at the time of the price increase remain at the minimum level 
the power plan was introduced at the beginning of our second quarter of  in response to customer requests for a fixed monthly pricing plan for unlimited usage 
under the power plan  a user purchases unlimited postage at face value  for a flat monthly fee of 
for the fourth quarter of  over of our service fee revenues was generated from power plan customers 
service fees are calculated and charged at the end of a monthly billing cycle 
we also generate revenues from controlled access advertising to our existing customer base  and revenue share and bounty arrangements 
as we continue to grow our customer base for the internet postage service  and implement our new business strategy  we expect to see an increase in our revenues for as compared to our revenues in internet shipping services we offer an internet based  multi carrier mailing and shipping service that is targeted both at small businesses with less than employees and at large companies with more than employees 
we believe that our enterprise service for corporations with or more employees will enable them to centrally manage and control costs from mailing and shipping activities across multiple carriers and can be distributed to thousands of corporate desktops using only a web browser 
the largest customer to date of the enterprise service is mail boxes etc 
usa  inc  a retail business  communication and postal services franchiser

we are currently working with mail boxes etc 
usa  inc in an effort to resolve this dispute 
on january   the fixed monthly service fee converted to a per transaction fee 
given current transaction volume being produced by mail boxes etc 
usa  inc franchises  we do not expect in the short term to achieve the level of monthly revenue that has been produced under the year fixed monthly service fee arrangement
