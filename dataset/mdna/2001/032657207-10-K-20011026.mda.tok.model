business environment and risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contain statements which  to the extent that they are not recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements  including statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties and actual events and results may differ significantly from those indicated in any forward looking statements as a result of a number of important factors  including those discussed below 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to analogic common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business 
any of these risks could have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers  any decrease in revenue from theses customers could harm our operating results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in our customers orders may have a significant impact on our operating results 
if a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us  there would be an adverse impact on our operating results 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our total net sales for our three largest customers in any of the last three fiscal years and the percentage of our total net sales to our ten largest customers in those years year ended july  philips general electric toshiba ten largest customers as a group although we are seeking to broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers 
because it often takes significant time to replace lost business  it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel  delay or reduce significant orders in the future 
our customer agreements typically permit the customer to discontinue future purchases after timely notice 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell and the services we provide to our major customers 
although our major customers are large corporations  if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our services  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition from existing or new companies in the medical instrumentation technology industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we are subject to competition based upon product design  performance  pricing  quality and services and we believe our innovative engineering and product reliability have been important factors in our growth 
while we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products which are directly comparable to products manufactured by others  in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others 
our competitors include divisions of some larger  more diversified organizations as well as several specialized companies 
some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have 
many of our oem customers and potential oem customers have the capacity to design and manufacture the products we manufacture for themselves 
we face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research and product development and manufacturing versus outsourcing 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for our components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we order raw materials and components to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
in the past  there have been industry wide shortages of electronics components 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we may have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  supply shortages of particular components will substantially curtail production of products using these components 
we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers 
accordingly  some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
we also depend on a small number of suppliers  some of whom are affiliated with customers or competitors and others of whom may be small  poorly financed companies  for many of the other raw materials and components that we use in our business 
if we are unable to continue to purchase these raw materials and components from our suppliers  our operating results would be adversely affected 
because many of our costs are fixed  our margins depend on our volume of output at our facilities and a reduction in volume will adversely affect our margins 
if we are left with excess inventory  our operating results will be adversely affected 
because of long lead times and specialized product designs  we typically purchase components and manufacture products for customer orders or in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts 
for a variety of reasons  such as decreased end user demand for the products we are manufacturing  our customers may not purchase all of the products we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components 
in either event  we would attempt to recoup our materials and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors  disposing of excess inventory through other channels or requiring our oem customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory 
some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our oem customers to do this 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs  not only would our net sales be adversely affected  but also our operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected 
moreover  carrying excess inventory would reduce the working capital we have available to continue to operate and grow our business 
uncertainties and adverse trends affecting our industry or any of our major customers may adversely affect our operating results 
our business depends primarily on a specific segment of the electronics industry  medical instrumentation technology products  which is subject to rapid technological change and pricing and margin pressure 
this industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and production over capacity 
in addition  changes in government policy relating to reimbursement for the purchase and use of medical capital equipment could also affect our sales 
our customers markets are also subject to economic cycles and are likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting our industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  may adversely affect our operating results 
our businesses outside the medical instrumentation technology product sector are subject to the same or greater technological and cyclical pressures 
our customers delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for their products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are used by a number of our customers in the production of medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
a delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a further risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices 
medical device products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  which could affect the market price of our common stock 
our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control  and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
these factors include variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in demand for our customers existing products  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor  and foreign currency exposure 
as is the case with many technology companies  we typically ship a significant portion of our products in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering and operations personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in research and product development and manufacturing processes we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to provide research and product development and manufacturing services that meet the changing needs of our customers 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
as a result  we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product design and manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  assure you that our development efforts will be successful
