item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview host marriott corporation  a maryland corporation formerly named hmc merger corporation operating through an umbrella partnership structure  is the owner of hotel properties 
we operate as a self managed and self administered reit with our operations conducted solely through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
as of december   we owned approximately of the operating partnership 
on february   certain minority partners converted million op units to common shares and immediately sold them to an underwriter for sale on the open market 
as a result  we now own approximately of the operating partnership 
as of december   we owned  or had controlling interests in  upscale and luxury  full service hotel lodging properties generally located throughout the united states and operated primarily under the marriott  ritz carlton  four seasons  hilton  hyatt and swissotel brand names 
in december  the reit modernization act was passed  effective for taxable years beginning after december   which significantly amends the reit laws applicable to us 
prior to that time  reits were restricted from deriving revenues directly from the operations of hotels 
thus  during and we leased substantially all of our hotels to subsidiaries of crestline and other third party lessees 
under the reit modernization act  beginning january   i we are now permitted to lease our hotels to a subsidiary that is a taxable corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary rather than to a third party such as crestline and ii we may own all of the voting stock of such trs 
consequently  on november   we executed a definitive agreement with crestline to terminate our lease arrangements through the purchase of the crestline lessee entities that own the leasehold interests with respect to of our full service hotels 
in connection therewith  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a non recurring  pre tax loss of million net of a tax benefit of million which we have recognized as a deferred tax asset because  for income tax purposes  the acquisition is recognized as an asset that will be amortized over the remaining term of the leases 
we consummated the transaction effective january  under the terms of the transaction  our wholly owned subsidiary  which will elect to be treated as a trs  acquired the crestline lessee entities 
beginning in  we will recognize the revenues and expenses generated by the hotels subject to the leases rather than rental income 
the transaction simplifies our corporate structure  enables us to better control our portfolio of hotels  and is expected to be accretive to our future earnings and cash flows 
during february  our board of directors approved the acquisition by our trs of the interests in our non controlled subsidiaries held by the host marriott statutory employee charitable trust for approximately million  which is also permitted as a result of the reit modernization act 
if the transaction is consummated  and there can be no assurance that it will be consummated  on a consolidated basis our results of operations will reflect the revenues and expenses generated by the two taxable corporations  and our consolidated balance sheets will include the various assets and related liabilities held by the two taxable corporations  which were million and million as of december  approximately million of the subsidiaries debt principal matures during in addition  we will consolidate three additional full service properties  one located in missouri  and two located in mexico city  mexico 
during the year  we focused on maintaining the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet in order to allow us the opportunity to selectively choose investment alternatives that will further enhance shareholder value 

during and the first quarter of  our primary use of free cash flow and asset sales proceeds was the funding of our stock buyback program 
in the aggregate  we spent approximately million for a total reduction of million equivalent shares on a fully diluted basis 

during june  we modified our bank credit facility in order to provide the company greater financial flexibility 
as modified  the total facility has been permanently reduced to million  and the original term was extended for two additional years 

in october  we issued million series f senior notes due in  which were exchanged for series g senior notes in march 
during march  we issued million shares of class c preferred stock  for net proceeds of million 
we and marriott international closed on the settlement with plaintiffs to resolve specific litigation involving seven limited partnerships in which we acted as general partner 
the settlement involved an acquisition during the fourth quarter of of the limited partner interests in two partnerships by a joint venture between one of our affiliates and a subsidiary of marriott international  the contribution by our non controlled subsidiaries of their general partnership interests in the partnerships and cash payments to partners in the other five partnerships  in exchange for resolution of claims against all defendants in all seven partnerships 
our total share of the cash required to resolve the litigation  including amounts paid by our non controlled subsidiary  was approximately million 
as a result of the settlement  we recorded a one time non recurring  pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of results of operations our historical revenues for and represent rental income on leases  net gains on property transactions  interest income and equity in earnings affiliates 
expenses represent specific owner costs including real estate and property taxes  property insurance and ground and equipment rent 
for  we reported gross property level sales from our hotels and  accordingly  our expenses included all property level costs including depreciation  management fees  real and personal property taxes  ground building and equipment rent  property insurance and other costs 
beginning january   we will again report the gross property level results from our hotels as a result of changes in the reit tax laws and the subsequent acquisition by the trs of the crestline lessee entities 
as a result  our results will not be comparable to the historical reported amounts for and in order to provide a clearer understanding and comparability of our results of operations we have presented unaudited pro forma statements of operations for and  adjusted to reflect the acquisition of the crestline lessee entities as if it occurred on january   and a discussion of the results thereof beginning on page in addition to our discussion of the historical results

comparative ffo and ebitda are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business 
furthermore  management believes that comparative ffo and ebitda are meaningful disclosures that will help shareholders and the investment community to better understand our financial performance  including comparing our performance to other reits 
however  comparative ffo and ebitda as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

as a result of this reorganization we are the sole general partner in the operating partnership and as of december  held approximately of the outstanding op units

op units owned by holders other than us are redeemable at the option of the holder  generally commencing one year after the issuance of their op units 
upon redemption of an op unit  the holder would receive from the operating partnership cash in an amount equal to the market value of one share of our common stock  or at our option  a share of our common stock

leases 
in addition to our full service hotels  we also lease some property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  including the long term ground leases for some of our hotels  generally with multiple renewal options 
the leases related to the courtyard properties and residence inn properties sold during and  are nonrecourse to us and contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts 
we remain contingently liable on some leases related to divested non lodging properties 
such contingent liabilities aggregated million at december  however  management considers the likelihood of any substantial funding related to these divested properties leases to be remote 
inflation 
our hotel lodging properties have been impacted by inflation through its effect on increasing costs and on the managers ability to increase room rates 
unlike other real estate  hotels have the ability to change room rates on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation often can be passed on to customers 
approximately all of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in the rate of inflation on future interest costs 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the interest recognized on the debt obligations is based on various libor terms  which ranged from to and to at december  and december   respectively 
in july  we completed the refinancing of approximately million of outstanding variable rate mortgage debt and terminated the related interest rate swap agreements 
in june  we completed the refinancing of approximately million of outstanding variable rate mortgage debt
