item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our historical consolidated financial position at december  and  and results of operations and cash flows for each of the years ended december   and our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
overview our revenues  profitability and future growth rates will be substantially dependent upon our drilling success in the san juan and delaware basins  and prevailing prices for oil and gas  which are in turn dependent upon numerous factors that are beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been volatile  and oil and gas prices can be expected to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we may produce economically 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are capital intensive 
historically  our principal sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  borrowings and proceeds from sales of stock 
our principal uses of capital have been for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties and related facilities 
our current capital expenditure budget is approximately million  with which we plan to drill or recomplete approximately wells 
to fund these expenditures  we plan to use approximately million of the net proceeds from our october equity offering described below  with the remainder to be funded with expected cash flow from operations 
currently  the amount available under our aquila agreement is approximately million 
beginning in march  substantially all of our cash flow from operations was to be used to make principal payments to aquila 
on march   aquila agreed to waive the requirement for principal payments 
instead  the repayment schedule for the twelve months beginning april  is as follows i for the months april to september  we will pay interest only  or approximately million  and ii from october to march  we will make monthly principal and interest payments of  or a total of million 
aquila will evaluate the loan monthly and  at its sole discretion  can discontinue the repayment schedule described above and revert to the requirement of principal payments equal to defined cash flow 
we anticipate the aquila credit agreement will be amended during second quarter to reflect the changes described above 
we will continue to seek to increase the amount available under the aquila credit agreement and to revise the repayment requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to further amend the aquila credit agreement 
in october  we issued  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds  after commissions and other costs  of approximately million  which will be used primarily to finance our oil and gas drilling activities 
in september  we established our credit agreement with aquila 
the initial amount available under the agreement was million  which was increased to million in november by its current terms  the amount available under the agreement may be increased to as much as million  as new reserves are added through our development drilling program 
at march   we had drawn approximately million under the aquila agreement  leaving approximately million available 
however  under the current terms of the aquila agreement  the remaining amount available may not be drawn for capital expenditures 
the aquila facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
interest on the aquila facility accrues at prime plus and was added to the loan balance through march  the outstanding loan balance is due in full on september  as part of the aquila financing  we also entered into a four year agency agreement with aquila under which we pay a marketing fee equal to of the net proceeds as defined from the sale of all of our oil and gas production to market our gas and to negotiate our gas purchase contracts 
in addition  we also issued to aquila  shares of common stock 
aquila also has a one time right to require us to purchase  of our common shares from aquila at per share during the day period beginning september  in september  we also entered into a five year  million master rental contract with universal compression  inc to refinance our east blanco gas sweetening plant 
the proceeds from that financing were used to repay a term loan from bank one  texas  na that was secured by the plant 
the master rental contract bears interest at an imputed rate of 
payments under the master rental contract commenced in september we made principal payments totaling  and  to universal compression during and  respectively 
during  prior to its retirement  we made principal payments of  on the bank one term loan 
in july  we negotiated an unsecured term loan for up to  with bank one  colorado  na to finance the purchase of land and a building for our field office 
we drew  on this loan during principal and interest at is payable quarterly beginning october  we repaid  and  of this loan during and  respectively 
in march  the due date of the loan was extended from july to april in april  we redeemed  shares of our series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at the mandatory redemption price of per share by issuing a convertible promissory note for  to the series b holder 
interest on the note accrued at and was payable quarterly beginning on june  the note and all accrued interest was paid in full in october we will be required to redeem the remaining  shares of series b preferred stock in april at per share  and plan to do so with available funds 
the series b preferred stock is convertible to common stock automatically if the common stock trades at a price in excess of of the then applicable conversion price for each day in a period of consecutive trading days 
the conversion price is currently 
in april  the government of costa rica awarded us a concession to explore for oil and natural gas on approximately million acres in the northeast quadrant of costa rica 
we have completed an environmental assessment of our proposed operations  and are currently in the process of negotiating final concession contracts 
once we sign final contracts  the work program is expected to require the expenditure of million including the drilling of six wells over a three year period  with a possible extension of three more years 
we will need to secure joint venture or other additional financing in order to complete the work program

year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  the increase was due to higher oil and gas prices and higher gas production 
average oil prices for the year ended december  increased to per barrel from per barrel for the year ended december  and average gas prices for the year ended december  increased to per mcf from per mcf for the year ended december  natural gas constituted approximately of our production in and in oil production for the year ended december  decreased to  barrels from  barrels for the year ended december  and gas production for the year ended december  increased to  mcf from  mcf for the year ended december  gas production for was up from because of the resumption of our drilling and recompletion program in fourth quarter after the receipt of additional financing 
we have been focusing on drilling gas wells 
oil and gas production expenses 
oil and gas production expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in production taxes due to higher prices in production taxes are calculated and paid on prices before hedging gains or losses 
as a percentage of sales before hedging losses  production tax and marketing expense was in both and production tax and marketing expense per mcfe increased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  lease operating expense loe per mcfe increased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  loe per mcfe in is higher primarily due to increased field personnel costs and possessory interest taxes relative to increases in production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to higher depletion expense 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher ratio of increases in capital expenditures to increases in reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the issuance of employee stock options with a below market strike price and increased costs for contract and consulting services 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings and higher interest rates 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for us federal income tax purposes in and  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our oil and gas producing activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our decision to provide a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we did not recognize any tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for us federal income tax purposes of  which will begin to expire in extraordinary loss 
we incurred an extraordinary loss of  during the year ended december   as a result of the refinancing of our debt with a new lender 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
we paid the dividend of  and  on  and  face amount series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and realized accretion of  and  respectively 
in  we issued  shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock  in conjunction with a refinancing 
in  we issued an additional  shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock in conjunction with an amendment to the same financing agreement 
the difference between the value of the shares at the redemption price of per share and the market value of the shares at the date of issuance will be accreted over a period of up to months 
during and  we realized accretion of  and  respectively  related to these shares 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  the increase was due to higher oil and gas prices 
oil production for the year ended december  decreased to  barrels from  barrels for the year ended december  and gas production for the year ended december  decreased to  mcf from  mcf for the year ended december  production for was down from because our drilling and recompletion program was delayed pending the receipt of additional financing  which we received in september during fourth quarter  we drilled or recompleted wells with funds from the refinancing 
production decreases were offset by increases in average oil and gas prices realized in from those realized in average oil prices for the year ended december  increased to per barrel from per barrel for the year ended december  and average gas prices for the year ended december  increased to per mcf from per mcf for the year ended december  oil and gas production expenses 
oil and gas production expenses for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one time production tax credits 
production tax and marketing expense per mcfe decreased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  lease operating expense loe per mcfe increased  or  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  loe per mcfe in is higher primarily due to workovers 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to lower depletion expense 
depletion per mcfe for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to a lesser cost base resulting from the write down of oil and gas properties of million in fourth quarter  discussed below 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission  we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis 
net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related tax effects 
application of these rules generally requires pricing future production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we made a non cash charge in fourth quarter to write down our us oil and gas properties by  in applying the ceiling test  we used december  oil and gas prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
we currently operate only in the continental united states 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to stock compensation expense of  recognized in fourth quarter related to the extension of the expiration date of certain warrants to purchase our common stock 
in addition  in fourth quarter of we expensed  of costs related to an equity offering which we did not consummate 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for us federal income tax purposes in and  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income

net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 
the net loss for the year ended december   includes  relating to a non cash write down of oil and gas properties discussed above 
we paid the dividend of  on  and  face amount series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and realized accretion of  in each year 
in  we issued  shares of mandatorily redeemable common stock  in conjunction with a refinancing 
the difference between the value of the shares at the redemption price of per share and the market value of the shares at the date of issuance will be accreted over a period of months 
during  we realized accretion of  related to these shares 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of  for the year ended december  hedging activities we use hedging instruments to manage commodity price risks 
we have used energy swaps and other financial arrangements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
gains and losses on such transactions are matched to product sales and charged or credited to oil and gas sales when that product is sold 
management believes that the use of various hedging arrangements can be a prudent means of protecting our financial interests from the volatility of oil and gas prices 
under our credit agreement with aquila  we may be required to maintain price hedging arrangements in place with respect to up to of our oil and gas production upon terms satisfactory to us and aquila 
we recognized hedging losses gains of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
miscellaneous our oil and gas operations are significantly affected by certain provisions of the internal revenue code that are applicable to the oil and gas industry 
current law permits our intangible drilling and development costs to be deducted currently  or capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
we  as an independent producer  are also entitled to a deduction for percentage depletion with respect to the first  barrels per day of domestic crude oil and or equivalent units of domestic natural gas produced if such percentage depletion exceeds cost depletion 
generally  this deduction is of gross income from an oil and gas property  without reference to the taxpayer s basis in the property 
the percentage depletion deduction may not exceed of the taxable income from a given property 
further  percentage depletion is limited in the aggregate to of our taxable income 
any depletion disallowed under the limitation  however  may be carried over indefinitely 
inflation has not historically had a material impact on our financial statements  and management does not believe that we will be materially more or less sensitive to the effects of inflation than other companies in the oil and gas industry 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we use commodity derivative financial instruments  including swaps  to reduce the effect of natural gas price volatility on a portion of our natural gas production 
commodity swap agreements are generally used to fix a price at the natural gas market location or to fix a price differential between the price of natural gas at henry hub and the price of gas at its market location 
settlements are based on the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified in the agreement 
the following table summarizes our derivative financial instrument position on our natural gas and crude oil production as of december  the fair value of these instruments reflected below is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to settle the contracts as of december  actual settlement of these instruments when they mature will differ from these estimates reflected in the table 
gains or losses realized from these instruments hedging our production are expected to be offset by changes in the actual sales price received by us for our natural gas and crude oil production 
see hedging activities above 
natural gas fixed price year mmbtu per mmbtu fair value crude oil fixed price year bbls per bbl fair value under our credit agreement with aquila  we may be required to maintain price hedging arrangements in place with respect to up to of our oil and gas production 
accordingly  included above are agreements to hedge a total of  barrels of oil related to production for at fixed prices ranging from per barrel and to hedge a total of  mmbtu of gas related to production for at fixed prices ranging from per mmbtu 
in addition  we entered into basis swaps to fix the differential between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is to be sold for  mmbtu for at december   these swaps had a fair value of  in november  we entered into one year costless collar contracts pursuant to which we hedged the price of  mmbtu per month beginning january based on an el paso permian index 
we will receive per mmbtu if the settlement price is below per mmbtu 
if the settlement price is greater than per mmbtu  we will pay the difference between such settlement price and per mmbtu
