results of operations certain factors affecting results of operations the company s results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors 
in addition  results of operations in the past have been  and in the future may continue to be  materially affected by many factors of a global nature  including economic and market conditions  the availability and cost of capital  the level and volatility of equity prices and interest rates  currency values and other market indices  technological changes and events such as the increased use of the internet to conduct electronic commerce and the continued development of electronic communications trading networks  the availability and cost of credit  inflation  investor sentiment  and legislative  legal and regulatory developments 
such factors also may have an impact on the company s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis  including without limitation continued increased market share in its securities activities  growth in assets under management and the expansion of its credit services business 
the company s securities business  particularly its involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products  including derivatives  is subject to substantial positive and negative fluctuations due to a variety of factors that cannot be predicted with great certainty  including variations in the fair value of securities and other financial products and the volatility and liquidity of global trading markets 
fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity  which  among other things  affects the size  number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from the company s private equity and other principal investments 
the level of global market activity also could impact the flow of investment capital into mutual funds and the way in which such capital is allocated among money market  equity  fixed income or other investment alternatives  which could cause fluctuations to occur in the company s asset management business 
in the company s credit services business  changes in economic variables  such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings  the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer debt  may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality  which  in turn  could impact overall credit services results 
the company s results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors 
included among the principal competitive factors affecting the securities business are the quality of its professionals and other personnel  its products and services  relative pricing and innovation 
competition in the company s asset management business is affected by a number of factors  including investment objectives and performance  advertising and sales promotion efforts  and the level of fees  distribution channels and types and quality of services offered 
in credit services  competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit cards  credit cardmember acquisition and customer utilization of credit cards  all of which are impacted by the type of fees  interest rates and other features offered 
in addition to competition from firms traditionally engaged in the financial services business  there has been increased competition in recent years from other sources  such as commercial banks  insurance companies  online service providers  sponsors of mutual funds and other companies offering financial services both in the us and globally 
the financial services industry has continued to experience consolidation and convergence as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have merged 
this convergence trend is expected to continue and could result in the company s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources  such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity 
in addition  the passage of the gramm leach bliley act in the us  effectively repealing certain sections of the glass steagall act  has allowed commercial banks  securities firms and insurance firms to affiliate  which has accelerated consolidation and may lead to increasing competition in markets which traditionally have been dominated by investment banks and retail securities firms 
the company also has experienced increased competition for qualified employees in recent years  including from companies engaged in internet related businesses and private equity funds  in addition to the traditional competition for employees from the financial services  insurance and management consulting industries 
the company s ability to sustain or improve its competitive position will substantially depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
as a result of the above economic and competitive factors  net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
the company intends to manage its business for the long term and to mitigate the potential effects of market downturns by strengthening its competitive position in the global financial services industry through diversification of its revenue sources and enhancement of its global franchise 
the company s overall financial results will continue to be affected by its ability and success in maintaining high levels of profitable business activities  emphasizing fee based assets that are designed to generate a continuing stream of revenues  evaluating credit product pricing  managing risks in the securities  asset management and credit services businesses  and managing costs 
in addition  the complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present  among other things  technological  risk management and other infrastructure challenges that will require effective resource allocation in order for the company to remain competitive 
the company believes that technological advancements in the internet and the growth of electronic commerce will continue to present both challenges and opportunities to the company and has led to significant changes and innovations in the financial markets and financial services industry as a whole 
the company s initiatives in this area have included web enabling existing businesses or enhancing client communication and access to information and services as well as making investments  or otherwise participating  in alternative trading systems  electronic communications networks and related businesses or technologies 
the company expects to continue to augment these initiatives in the future 
global market and economic conditions in fiscal global market and economic conditions during fiscal were generally more challenging in comparison with those experienced during the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the vigorous pace of global economic expansion frequently gave rise to indications of increasing inflationary pressures 
in an effort to mitigate these conditions  several interest rate increases were initiated by major central banks globally  particularly in the us and europe  which increased corporate and consumer borrowing costs 
as a result of the rising global interest rate environment and a sharp rise in the level of energy prices  it appeared more likely that the rate of global economic growth would decelerate in the future 
these conditions  coupled with indications of slowing corporate earnings growth  led to difficult conditions in global equity and fixed income securities markets  particularly during the latter half of fiscal however  despite the presence of less favorable global market and economic conditions  the company achieved record results in fiscal as each of its three business segments securities  asset management and credit services generated record levels of net income 
the company s securities business benefited from record revenues in its investment banking  equity trading and commodity trading activities and ended the fiscal year with record levels of financial advisors and customer accounts 
in the company s asset management business  customer assets under management or supervision increased to record levels during fiscal  while results in the company s credit services business reflected a continued improvement in the credit quality of cardmember receivables as well as record levels of cardmember transaction volume and managed consumer loans see business segments herein 
in the us  the domestic economy exhibited positive fundamentals and a strong rate of growth during much of fiscal several favorable economic trends  such as historically low levels of unemployment  high levels of consumer confidence and spending  strong productivity gains and a high demand for imports  continued to persist 
however  throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the ongoing expansion of the us economy  coupled with a tight domestic labor market  increased fears of accelerating inflation 
in an effort to slow the us economy and to mitigate inflationary pressures  the federal reserve board the fed continued to tighten monetary policy during fiscal by raising the overnight lending rate on two separate occasions by an aggregate of 
between june and may  the fed raised the overnight lending rate on six occasions aggregating 
during the latter half of fiscal  there were indications that the fed s interest rate actions were beginning to have the desired impact on the us economy 
however  the prospects for slower economic growth in the future and its impact on corporate earnings contributed to declines in us financial markets as the major stock market indices the standard poor s  the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq all were lower at the end of fiscal than at the beginning of the year 
the decline in the market values of internet and technology stocks and high yield fixed income securities was particularly significant 
the sharp rise in global energy prices  coupled with lingering uncertainty over the resolution of the us presidential election  also contributed to periods of increased volatility in the financial markets during the latter half of fiscal at fiscal year end  there remained much uncertainty as to whether the fed would ease its interest rate policy should the indications of slowing economic growth in the us persist in the future 
economic conditions within europe also contributed to periods of heightened volatility in the region s financial markets during fiscal the rates of economic growth within the uk and the european union the eu were generally strong in the first half of fiscal  although the euro fell to record lows against the us dollar during fiscal as the growth rate of the us economy continued to outpace the growth rate within the eu 
the region s level of economic growth  coupled with the falling value of the euro and the sharp rise in global energy prices  gave rise to fears of accelerating inflation 
as a result  during fiscal  the european central bank the ecb raised interest rates within the eu on six occasions by an aggregate of 
the bank of england also raised interest rates within the uk on two occasions by an aggregate of 
investor uncertainty as to the region s future growth prospects in light of rising energy prices and a potential slowdown of the us economy contributed to the decline in many of the major stock market indices within the european region during fiscal economic conditions also were challenging in the far east during fiscal in japan  there were indications that the steps taken by its government to increase economic activity  including bank bailouts  emergency loans  stimulus packages and tax cuts for both individuals and corporations  were beginning to have a favorable impact on the nation s economic performance 
as a result  during fiscal  the bank of japan raised interest rates by amid indications of growing business confidence and industrial production 
however  japan s financial markets were adversely impacted by continuing concerns about the nation s banking system  its growing budget deficit and the economy s future growth prospects 
investors also were concerned with the impact of rising energy prices and the potential for a slowdown in the level of global economic growth  which would have an adverse effect on the level of japan s exports 
certain financial markets elsewhere in the far east also experienced declines during fiscal  reflecting lower levels of economic activity 
in addition  political instability existed within the region  particularly in thailand  indonesia and the philippines  which had an adverse impact on the region s financial markets during the year 
the worldwide market for mergers and acquisitions continued to be robust during fiscal the volume of global merger and acquisition transactions reached record levels and contributed to record revenues by the company s investment banking business 
the merger and acquisition market reflected ongoing consolidation and globalization  and transaction activity was strong across many industries  particularly in the technology  media and telecommunications sectors 
the volume of merger and acquisition transactions was particularly strong during the first half of fiscal  while increased volatility in the financial markets adversely impacted transaction activity in the latter part of the year 
during fiscal  the level of cross border transactions remained strong  although the level of activity in the european merger and acquisition markets declined  reflecting volatility in the region s financial markets and the continued depreciation in the value of the euro 
similarly  the worldwide market for debt and equity underwriting transactions was generally strong in fiscal  fueled by a need to raise capital to finance merger and acquisition transactions and other strategic initiatives 
however  increased uncertainty in the global financial markets significantly reduced transaction volumes during the latter half of fiscal declines in the global equity markets led to the postponement or cancellation of many new equity issues  particularly during the fourth quarter of fiscal fixed income underwriting activity was negatively affected by the rising global interest rate environment  which increased borrowing costs 
the market for new issuances of high yield fixed income securities was particularly difficult during the latter half of fiscal as heightened concerns of deteriorating credit quality and rising default rates reduced investor demand for these securities 
in fiscal  us consumer demand and purchases continued to increase at a strong pace 
the relatively strong domestic economy that continued to exist in the us for much of the year enabled consumers to manage finances advantageously while still allowing for steady growth in consumer credit 
similarly  the level of loan losses and personal bankruptcies continued to decline 
us economic growth moderated during the latter half of fiscal  reflecting  among other things  the fed s efforts to slow the rate of economic growth 
the company continued to invest in the growth of its credit card business through the expansion of discover business services  as evidenced by a record number of new merchant enrollments in fiscal  the second consecutive year of achieving record new merchant enrollments

the results of both years were partially offset by increased costs for incentive based compensation  as well as increased non compensation expenses associated with the company s higher level of global business activities 
in addition  fiscal s results were negatively affected by more difficult economic and market conditions during the latter half of the year  which reduced the volume of merger and acquisition and underwriting transactions and contributed to a more difficult trading environment

in fiscal  the high level of transaction activity reflected the continuing trends of consolidation and globalization as well as a high level of merger and acquisition transaction volume in the technology  media and telecommunications sectors 
however  transaction volume decreased in the latter half of fiscal as volatility in the global equity markets and a decrease in equity valuations reduced the purchasing power of potential acquirers

revenues from underwriting global high yield fixed income securities declined significantly  reflecting difficult conditions in this market sector 
in addition  investor demand for these securities declined due to heightened concerns over credit quality 
revenues from underwriting derivative fixed income products also declined 
these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues from securitized debt issuances  resulting from an increased volume of asset backed transactions

in addition  the relatively low levels of interest rates in the us during much of the year allowed issuers to take advantage of lower borrowing costs 
the european economic and monetary union  which permitted many corporate issuers to access the euro denominated credit market  and the need for strategic financing in light of the robust global market for mergers and acquisitions also had a favorable impact on the volume of fixed income underwriting transactions

fixed income trading revenues decreased in fiscal  primarily reflecting lower revenues from global high yield and investment grade fixed income securities 
trading revenues from global high yield fixed income securities decreased significantly due to lighter trading activity and decreased market liquidity  which resulted in markdowns of certain high yield positions 
during fiscal  several high yield issuers experienced financial difficulties  triggering an increased number of credit downgrades and defaults  particularly in the telecommunications sector 
as a result  investors became more concerned about the credit quality of issuers  particularly during the latter half of fiscal revenues from investment grade fixed income securities also declined  reflecting more difficult market conditions  which resulted in reduced liquidity and widening credit spreads

market conditions and trading volumes were more moderate during the latter half of fiscal  primarily reflecting a rising interest rate environment in the us and europe 
foreign exchange revenues decreased in fiscal  reflecting lower levels of trading volumes and volatility in the global foreign exchange markets

in fiscal  foreign exchange revenues declined from the record level of revenues achieved in fiscal the decrease primarily reflected reduced customer trading volumes and lower levels of volatility in the global foreign exchange markets as compared with the prior year 
commodity trading revenues rose to a record level in fiscal  primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energy related products  including electricity  natural gas and crude oil 
trading revenues from energy related products benefited from periods of rising prices and increased volatility across the entire energy sector 
such conditions were primarily attributable to low inventory levels  strong demand and concerns regarding the adequacy of production levels 
in fiscal  commodities trading revenues rose  primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energy related products  including crude oil  refined energy products  electricity and natural gas

higher revenues from metals trading also contributed to the increase 
principal transaction investment revenues aggregating million were recognized in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal fiscal s revenues included realized gains from certain of the company s private equity investments  including commerce one  inc and equant nv  as well as gains from the company s other principal investment activities 
these gains were partially offset by unrealized losses in the private equity business  reflecting difficult market conditions in the telecommunications  technology and internet sectors 
fiscal s revenues reflected a record level of revenues recorded by the company s private equity business and included realized and unrealized gains from the company s positions in equant nv and knight trimark group inc net gains from increases in the value of certain other private equity and venture capital investments also contributed to fiscal s results 
securities purchased in principal investment transactions generally are held for appreciation and are not readily marketable

commission revenues from markets in japan and elsewhere in the far east increased as improved economic prospects within the region increased investor interest and led to higher transaction volumes

ichoice provides each of the company s individual investor clients with the choice of self directed investing online  a traditional full service brokerage relationship through a financial advisor  or some combination of both

merchant and cardmember fees merchant and cardmember fees include revenues from fees charged to merchants on credit card sales  late payment fees  overlimit fees  insurance fees and cash advance fees 
merchant and cardmember fees increased to  million during fiscal and decreased to  million during fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher merchant discount revenue and late payment fees associated with the use of the discover card 
the increase in discover card merchant discount revenues was primarily due to a record level of sales volume  coupled with an increase in the average merchant discount rate 
late payment fees increased in fiscal  primarily due to a fee increase introduced during april  coupled with an increase in the number of late fee occurrences  reflecting higher levels of transaction volume and consumer loans subject to such fees 
merchant and cardmember fees decreased in fiscal  primarily due to the company s sale of the operations of sps and the sale of prime option

servicing fees servicing fees are revenues derived from consumer loans which have been sold to investors through asset securitizations 
cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized loans are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment  to reimburse the investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the company a fee for servicing the loans 
any excess cash flows remaining are paid to the company 
the servicing fees and excess net cash flows paid to the company are reported as servicing fees in the consolidated statements of income 
the sale of consumer loans through asset securitizations  therefore  has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing fees 
the company completed asset securitizations of billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the asset securitizations in fiscal and have expected maturities ranging from approximately three to seven years from the date of issuance 
the table below presents the components of servicing fees fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions merchant and cardmember fees interest revenue    interest expense   provision for consumer loan losses    servicing fees   servicing fees are affected by the level of securitized loans  the spread between the interest yield on the securitized loans and the yield paid to the investors  the rate of credit losses on securitized loans and the level of cardmember fees earned from securitized loans 
servicing fees increased in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to higher levels of net interest cash flows and increased cardmember fee revenue  partially offset by higher credit losses associated with a higher level of average securitized consumer loans 
the increase in credit losses was partially offset by a lower level of charge offs related to the securitized portfolio 
the increase in fiscal was due to higher levels of cardmember fees and net interest income  primarily resulting from higher levels of average securitized loans 
the increase also reflected a decline in credit losses from securitized consumer loans resulting from a lower level of charge offs related to the discover card portfolio and the positive impact of the sale of the operations of sps  partially offset by an increase in the level of average securitized loans

the increase in average consumer loans was due to higher levels of sales and balance transfer volume and promotional programs 
the lower yield on discover card loans was primarily due to lower interest rates offered to new cardmembers and certain existing cardmembers  partially offset by the company s repricing of certain credit card receivables discussed below 
the lower yield also reflected an increase in consumer loans from balance transfers and from promotional purchases  which are generally offered at lower interest rates for an introductory period 
the increase in interest expense was due to a higher level of interest bearing liabilities  coupled with an increase in the company s average cost of borrowings  reflecting interest rate increases made by the fed in fiscal and the first half of fiscal the average prime rate for fiscal was as compared with for fiscal the decrease in net interest income in fiscal was primarily due to lower average levels of consumer loans and a lower yield on these loans 
the decrease in average consumer loans was due to the sale of the operations of sps  the sale of prime option and the discontinuance of the bravo card in fiscal as well as a higher level of securitized discover card loans 
the lower yield in fiscal was due to a lower yield on discover card loans  coupled with the exclusion of sps loans from the company s portfolio 
the lower yield on discover card loans was primarily due to the more competitive interest rates offered to both existing and new cardmembers as well as an increase in consumer loans from balance transfers 
in response to the rising interest rate environment in the us  the company repriced a substantial portion of its existing credit card receivables to a market indexed variable interest rate during the second and third quarters of fiscal the supplemental table below provides average managed loan balance and rate information  which takes into account both owned and securitized loans supplemental average managed loan information fiscal fiscal fiscal average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate dollars in millions general purpose credit card and other consumer loans    total interest earning assets    total interest bearing liabilities    consumer loan interest rate spread interest rate spread net interest margin provision for consumer loan losses the provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that the company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date

in addition  the provision for consumer loan losses in fiscal benefited from a decline in the loan loss allowance in connection with securitization transactions entered into prior to the third quarter of this loan loss allowance was fully amortized by the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a lower level of charge offs related to the discover card portfolio and the positive impact of the sale of the operations of sps  the sale of prime option and the discontinuance of the bravo card 
the provision for consumer loan losses also was positively impacted by a decline in the loan loss allowance in connection with securitization transactions entered into prior to the third quarter of as discussed above 
the company s future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of consumer loan delinquencies and charge offs  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  bankruptcy trends  the seasoning of the company s loan portfolio  interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior  and the rate and magnitude of changes in the company s consumer loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio 
consumer loans are considered delinquent when interest or principal payments become days past due 
consumer loans are charged off when they become days past due  except in the case of bankruptcies and fraudulent transactions  where loans are charged off earlier 
loan delinquencies and charge offs are primarily affected by changes in economic conditions and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors 
the net charge off rate decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  reflecting the company s continued focus on credit quality and account collections and a reduction in consumer bankruptcies as a result of the favorable us economic environment

the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower compensation costs resulting from the sale of prime option and the operations of sps 
these decreases in fiscal were partially offset by higher compensation costs associated with increased employment levels due to increased levels of business activity and transaction volume 
occupancy and equipment expense increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to higher occupancy costs associated with increased office space  including new transaction processing centers 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the exclusion of the results of prime option and sps  partially offset by higher occupancy costs associated with discover financial services 
information processing and communications expense increased in both fiscal and fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in volume related external data processing costs associated with the morgan stanley dean witter card in the uk  partially offset by the termination of an external transaction processing contract in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to higher external data processing costs incurred for domestic operations  including cardmember data analysis associated with increased portfolio activity  partially offset by the exclusion of the results of prime option and sps in fiscal marketing and business development expense increased in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher cardmember rewards expense associated with increased sales volume as well as increased advertising and direct mailing costs associated with both domestic and international operations 
marketing and business development expense increased in fiscal due to direct mailing and other promotional activities related to the launch and promotion of the discover platinum and morgan stanley dean witter cards  higher cardmember rewards expense and a new advertising campaign for the discover card 
higher cardmember rewards expense was due to increased sales volume 
cardmember rewards expense includes the cashback bonus r award program  pursuant to which the company annually pays discover card cardmembers and morgan stanley dean witter card cardmembers electing this feature a percentage of their purchase amounts ranging up to based upon a cardmember s annual level and type of purchases 
professional services expense decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects the exclusion of year consulting costs in fiscal s results  partially offset by higher costs associated with account collections  consumer credit counseling and the outsourcing of certain call center operations 
the increase in fiscal was due to higher costs associated with account collections  consumer credit counseling and year consulting costs  partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the sale of the operations of sps 
other expense primarily includes fraud losses  credit inquiry fees and other administrative costs 
other expense increased in fiscal and remained unchanged in fiscal as compared with fiscal in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to increases in certain domestic and international operating expenses due to higher levels of transaction volume and business activity 
in fiscal  increased operational costs associated with higher application and transaction volumes and costs associated with the launch of the morgan stanley dean witter card in the uk were offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the sale of the operations of sps 
seasonal factors the credit card lending activities of credit services are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing 
historically  a substantial percentage of credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  followed by a flattening or decline of consumer loans in the following calendar quarter 
merchant fees  therefore  historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting higher sales activity in the month of december 
additionally  higher cardmember rewards expense historically have been accrued in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume 
liquidity and capital resources the balance sheet the company s total assets increased to billion at november  from billion at november   primarily attributable to increases in securities borrowed  financial instruments owned  and cash and securities deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and other regulations segregated cash and deposits 
segregated cash and deposits increased due to an increase in customer cash balances  coupled with a decrease in the level of customers trading on margin 
aircraft under operating leases increased due to the purchase of ansett worldwide 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from securities transactions 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing and managing its business 
funding and capital policies the company s senior management establishes the overall funding and capital policies of the company  reviews the company s performance relative to these policies  monitors the availability of sources of financing  reviews the foreign exchange risk of the company  and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position 
the primary goal of the company s funding and liquidity activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments 
many of the company s businesses are capital intensive 
capital is required to finance  among other things  the company s securities inventories  underwritings  principal investments  private equity activities  consumer loans  bridge loans and other financings  and investments in fixed assets 
as a policy  the company attempts to maintain sufficient capital and funding sources in order to have the capacity to finance itself on a fully collateralized basis at all times  including periods of financial stress 
currently  the company believes it has sufficient capital to meet its needs 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain total equity  on a consolidated basis  at least equal to the sum of all of its subsidiaries equity 
subsidiary equity capital requirements are determined by regulatory requirements if applicable  asset mix  leverage considerations and earnings volatility 
the company views return on equity to be an important measure of its performance  in the context of both the particular business environment in which the company is operating and its peer group s results 
in this regard  the company actively manages its consolidated capital position based upon  among other things  business opportunities  capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies  regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and  therefore  in the future may expand or contract its capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses 
the company returns internally generated equity capital which is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends 
the company s liquidity policies emphasize diversification of funding sources 
the company also follows a funding strategy that is designed to ensure that the tenor of the company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
short term funding generally is obtained at rates related to us  euro or asian money market rates for the currency borrowed 
repurchase transactions are effected at negotiated rates 
other borrowing costs are negotiated depending upon prevailing market conditions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
maturities of both short term and long term financings are designed to minimize exposure to refinancing risk in any one period 
the volume of the company s borrowings generally fluctuates in response to changes in the amount of repurchase transactions outstanding  the level of the company s securities inventories and consumer loans receivable  and overall market conditions 
availability and cost of financing to the company can vary depending upon market conditions  the volume of certain trading activities  the company s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit 
the company  therefore  maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings 
the company has in place a contingency funding strategy  which provides a comprehensive one year action plan in the event of a severe funding disruption 
the company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories  consumer loans and illiquid assets and  therefore  maintains a long term debt to capitalization ratio at a level appropriate for the current composition of its balance sheet 
in general  fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt  and securities inventories and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding  floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating basis 
both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the company s credit services business are used to finance the company s consumer loan portfolio 
consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed 
the company uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the company s short term and long term debt ratings 
in addition  the company s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as over the counter derivative transactions 
as of january   the company s credit ratings were as follows commercial paper senior debt dominion bond rating service limited r middle aa low fitch f aa moody s investors service p aa rating and investment information  inc a aa standard poor s a aa fitch ibca  inc and duff phelps credit rating co 
merged on june  in addition  on december   fitch completed its acquisition of thomson financial bankwatch 
the combined company is using the former fitch ibca  inc rating scale 
on august   japan rating investment information  inc changed its name to rating and investment information  inc on may   standard poor s upgraded the company s commercial paper rating from a to a and upgraded the company s senior debt rating from a to aa 
as the company continues its global expansion and derives revenues increasingly from various currencies  foreign currency management is a key element of the company s financial policies 
the company benefits from operating in several different currencies because weakness in any particular currency often is offset by strength in another currency 
the company closely monitors its exposure to fluctuations in currencies and  where cost justified  adopts strategies to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance 
these strategies include engaging in various hedging activities to manage income and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and using foreign currency borrowings  when appropriate  to finance investments outside the us principal sources of funding the company funds its balance sheet on a global basis 
the company s funding for its securities and asset management businesses is raised through diverse sources 
these sources include the company s capital  including equity and long term debt  repurchase agreements  us  canadian  euro and japanese commercial paper  letters of credit  unsecured bond borrowings  securities lending  buy sell agreements  municipal reinvestments  master notes  and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
repurchase agreement transactions  securities lending and a portion of the company s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and  therefore  provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings 
the funding sources utilized for the company s credit services business include the company s capital  including equity and long term debt  asset backed securitizations  deposits  federal funds  and short term bank notes 
the company sells consumer loans through asset securitizations using several transaction structures 
during the second quarter of fiscal  an extendible asset backed certificate program was launched 
the company s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers  purchase federal funds and issue short term bank notes 
interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings  brokered and other time deposits

the company also has a separate ongoing repurchase authorization in connection with awards granted under its equity based compensation plans 
during fiscal  the company purchased  million of its common stock 
subsequent to november  and through january   the company purchased an additional million of its common stock  the unused portion of the capital management common stock repurchase authorization at january  was approximately million without giving effect to any outstanding put options

the company also has commitments to fund certain fixed assets and other less liquid investments  including at november  approximately million in connection with its private equity and other principal investment activities 
additionally  the company has provided  and will continue to provide  financing including margin lending and other extensions of credit to clients 
in connection with the company s fixed income securities activities  the company underwrites  trades  invests and makes markets in non investment grade instruments high yield instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield instruments are defined as fixed income  emerging market and preferred equity securities and distressed debt rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies as well as non rated securities which  in the opinion of management  are non investment grade 
high yield instruments generally involve greater risk than investment grade securities due to the lower credit ratings of the issuers  which typically have relatively high levels of indebtedness and  therefore  are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions 
in addition  the market for high yield instruments is  and may continue to be  characterized by periods of volatility and illiquidity 
the company has in place credit and other risk policies and procedures to monitor total inventory positions and risk concentrations for high yield instruments that are administered in a manner consistent with the company s overall risk management policies and control structure 
the company records high yield instruments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in the company s consolidated statements of income

in connection with certain of its business activities  the company provides financing or financing commitments to companies in the form of senior and subordinated debt  including bridge financing  on a selective basis 
the borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade 
these loans and funding commitments typically are secured against the borrower s assets  have varying maturity dates and are generally contingent upon certain representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower 
as part of these activities  the company may syndicate and trade certain positions of these loans 
at november  and  the aggregate value of investment grade loans and positions was billion and billion  respectively  and the aggregate value of non investment grade loans and positions was billion and billion  respectively 
at november   the company also had provided additional commitments associated with these activities to investment grade issuers aggregating billion and commitments to non investment grade issuers aggregating billion

effects of inflation and changes in foreign exchange rates because the company s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
us dollar assets typically are financed by direct borrowing or swap based funding in the same currency 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect non us dollar revenues as well as non us dollar expenses 
those foreign exchange exposures that arise and are not hedged by an offsetting foreign currency exposure are actively managed by the company to minimize risk of loss due to currency fluctuations 
derivative financial instruments the company actively offers to clients and trades for its own account a variety of financial instruments described as derivative products or derivatives 
these products generally take the form of futures  forwards  options  swaps  caps  collars  floors  swap options and similar instruments which derive their value from underlying interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodities  equity instruments  equity indices  reference credits or other assets 
all of the company s trading related divisions use derivative products as an integral part of their respective trading strategies  and such products are used extensively to manage the market exposure that results from a variety of proprietary trading activities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a dealer in certain derivative products  most notably interest rate and currency swaps  the company enters into derivative contracts to meet a variety of risk management and other financial needs of its clients 
given the highly integrated nature of derivative products and related cash instruments in the determination of overall trading division profitability and the context in which the company manages its trading areas  it is not meaningful to allocate trading revenues between the derivative and underlying cash instrument components 
moreover  the risks associated with the company s derivative activities  including market and credit risks  are managed on an integrated basis with associated cash instruments in a manner consistent with the company s overall risk management policies and control structure see risk management following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
it should be noted that while particular risks may be associated with the use of derivatives  in many cases derivatives serve to reduce  rather than increase  the company s exposure to market  credit and other risks 
the total notional value of derivative trading contracts outstanding at november  was  billion as compared with  billion at november  
while these amounts are an indication of the degree of the company s use of derivatives for trading purposes  they do not represent the company s market or credit exposure and may be more indicative of customer utilization of derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or the fair value of the underlying financial instruments or commodities 
the company s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of such contracts reported as assets 
such total fair value outstanding as of november  was billion 
approximately billion of that credit risk exposure was with counterparties rated single a or better see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that derivatives are valuable tools that can provide cost effective solutions to complex financial problems and remains committed to providing its clients with innovative financial products 
the company established morgan stanley derivative products inc to offer derivative products to clients that will enter into derivative transactions only with triple a rated counterparties 
in addition  the company  through its continuing involvement with regulatory  self regulatory and industry activities  provides leadership in the development of policies and practices in order to maintain confidence in the markets for derivative products  which is critical to the company s ability to assist clients in meeting their overall financial needs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risk management policy and control structure risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
the extent to which the company properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability 
the company s broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole 
the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in the company s business activities market risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal risk and funding risk 
funding risk is discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business  the company s risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are evolutionary in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
the management committee  composed of the company s most senior officers  establishes the overall risk management policies for the company and reviews the company s performance relative to these policies 
the management committee has created several risk committees to assist it in monitoring and reviewing the company s risk management practices 
these risk committees  as well as other committees established to manage and monitor specific risks  review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to the company s market and credit risk profile  sales practices  pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy  legal enforceability  and operational and systems risks 
the firm risk management  controllers  treasury  and law and compliance departments  which are all independent of the company s business units  also assist senior management and the risk committees in monitoring and controlling the company s risk profile 
the firm risk management department is responsible for risk policy development  risk analysis and risk reporting to senior management and the risk committees and has operational responsibility for measuring and monitoring aggregate market and credit risk with respect to institutional trading activities 
in addition  the internal audit department  which also reports to senior management  periodically examines and evaluates the company s operations and control environment 
the company continues to be committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the company s risk management and monitoring systems and processes 
the following is a discussion of the company s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks other than funding risk 
the discussion focuses on the company s securities trading primarily its institutional trading activities and consumer lending and related activities 
the company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks 
this discussion and the estimated amounts of the company s market risk exposure generated by the company s statistical analyses are forward looking statements 
however  the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the company operates and certain other factors described below 
market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
for a discussion of the company s currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
trading and related activities primary market risk exposures and market risk management during fiscal  the company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and associated volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments eg  risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  the timing of mortgage prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads for corporate bonds  asset backed securities and emerging market debt 
the company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and equity derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk in connection with making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and with maintaining foreign exchange positions 
the company s foreign exchange trading covers many currencies  including the yen  euro and pound sterling 
the company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of trading in physical commodities  such as crude and refined oil  natural gas  electricity  precious and base metals  and in related derivatives 
the company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of strategies 
these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging through the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments  including a variety of derivative products eg  futures  forwards  swaps and options 
the company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a company wide basis  on a trading division level worldwide and on an individual product basis 
the company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and reflects the company s aggregate risk tolerance as established by the company s senior management 
market risk limits have been approved for the company and each major trading division of the company worldwide equity  fixed income  foreign exchange and commodities 
additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and  as appropriate  products and regions 
trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the firm risk management department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management 
the firm risk management department independently reviews the company s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing value at risk var and other quantitative and qualitative risk measurements and analyses 
the company s trading businesses and the firm risk management department also use  as appropriate  measures such as sensitivity to changes in rates  prices  volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures 
stress testing  which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products  is performed periodically and reviewed by trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the firm risk management department 
value at risk the statistical technique known as var is one of the tools used by management to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of the company s trading portfolios 
the firm risk management department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measures to various levels of management 
var methodology  assumptions and limitations the company estimates var using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures 
historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors and on information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes 
in the case of the company s var  approximately four years of historical data are used to characterize potential changes in market risk factors 
the company s one day var corresponds to the negative change in portfolio value that  based on observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in trading days 
the company s var model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price and interest rate risk and linear exposure to implied volatility risks 
market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and associated volatilities 
as a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors  the company s var model uses monte carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and in corporate and high yield bonds 
for example  the model includes measures of name specific risk for approximately  equity names and classes of corporate and high yield bonds 
var models such as the company s should be expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities 
for example  during fiscal  as part of the company s ongoing program of var model enhancement  position and risk coverage were broadened and risk measurement methodologies were refined for certain energy and fixed income products 
among their benefits  var models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporating a range of varied market risks  reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification  and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets yet are relatively easy to interpret 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the following past changes in market risk factors will not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value in response to market movements may differ from the responses calculated by a var model  var using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the company is aware of these and other limitations and  therefore  uses var as only one component in its risk management review process 
this process also incorporates stress testing and extensive risk monitoring and control at the trading desk  division and company levels 
var for fiscal the table below presents the company s var for each of the company s primary market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november   incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the company s institutional trading businesses 
this measure of var incorporates most of the company s trading related market risks 
however  a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk was not covered  and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions involved approximations that could be significant under certain circumstances 
aspects of market risk associated with positions reflected in the var results below that the company has found particularly difficult to model include certain risks associated with fixed income instruments such as prepayment behavior of mortgage backed securities and elements of credit derivatives price risk  name specific equity price risk in newly public companies  certain commodity price risks such as electricity price risk and certain liquidity risks 
aggregate var also incorporates a the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and b public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company 
the incremental impact on var of these non trading positions was not material as of november  and  and  therefore  the table below does not separately report trading and non trading vars 
non publicly traded principal investments made by the company are not reflected in the var results reported below 
as of november   the total amount of such investments was approximately billion 
since var statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance or its ability to monitor and manage risk 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in trading days 
one day var primary market risk category at november dollars in millions  pre tax interest rate equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price subtotal less diversification benefit aggregate var equals the difference between aggregate var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days  similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each such category 
the change in aggregate var and its interest rate and equity price components from november  to november  primarily reflected a reduction in municipal  emerging market and high yield debt positions in the company s trading portfolio and the sale of certain private equity positions 
in order to facilitate comparisons with other global financial services firms  the company notes that its aggregate var values at november  for other confidence levels and time horizons were as follows million for one day var and million for two week var 
the table below presents the high  low and average one day trading var over the course of fiscal for substantially all of the company s institutional trading activities 
certain market risks included in the year end var discussed above are excluded from this measure eg  equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions

there were no days during fiscal in which the company incurred daily mark to market losses trading revenue net of interest income and expense and excluding commissions and primary revenue credited to the trading businesses in its institutional trading business in excess of the one day var 
consumer lending and related activities interest rate risk and management in its consumer lending activities  the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally credit card and other consumer loans and net servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations  as well as the interest sensitive liabilities which finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  long term borrowings  deposits  federal funds  and short term bank notes 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings which may arise from changes in interest rates 
this is accomplished primarily by matching the repricing of credit card and consumer loans and the related financing 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  the company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve its matched financing objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing  from variable to fixed repricing or  in more limited circumstances  from variable to variable repricing 
sensitivity analysis methodology  assumptions and limitations for its consumer lending activities  the company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure  one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from its fiscal year end  the company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
in fiscal  a substantial portion of the company s credit card receivables was repriced to a variable interest rate 
these assets which have a market based index  such as the prime rate  which will reset before the end of the month period  or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans which may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the company s normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets which have a fixed rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
for the remainder of the company s credit card receivables which have a fixed interest rate  the company has the right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice the receivables to a new interest rate 
the company considers such receivables to be interest rate sensitive  consistent with its policy of matching the repricing of its credit card receivables and the related financing 
the company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date  which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities which have a market based index  such as the prime  commercial paper or libor rates  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
for liabilities which have a fixed rate at fiscal year end but which are assumed to reset to a market based index during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of november   it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
the comparable reduction of pre tax income for the month period following november  was estimated to be approximately million 
the reduction in pre tax income at november  was greater as compared with the prior year primarily due to the company s consumer loan repricing actions made during fiscal and the related impact of the funding supporting the company s consumer loans 
the hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next month period 
it does not assume any growth  strategic change in business focus  change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset liability funding mix 
thus  this model represents a static analysis which cannot adequately portray how the company would respond to significant changes in market conditions 
furthermore  the analysis does not necessarily reflect the company s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term  including the likelihood of an immediate basis point change in market interest rates  nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur 
credit risk the company s exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility that a customer or counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual commitment  which could result in the company incurring losses 
with respect to its institutional securities activities  the company has credit guidelines which limit the company s current and potential credit exposure to any one counterparty and to each type of counterparty by rating category 
the credit department that is responsible for the company s institutional securities activities administers and monitors these credit limits on a worldwide basis 
in addition to monitoring credit limits  the company manages the credit exposure relating to its trading activities by reviewing periodically counterparty financial soundness  by entering into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties in appropriate circumstances  and by limiting the duration of exposure 
in certain cases  the company also may close out transactions  enter into risk reducing transactions  assign transactions to other counterparties or purchase credit protection to mitigate credit risk 
with respect to the leveraged lending business  the leveraged financing commitment committee  which is composed of senior managers from various departments within the company  including the credit department  reviews each leveraged loan request 
with respect to its consumer lending activities  potential credit card holders undergo credit reviews by the credit department of discover financial services to establish that they meet standards of ability and willingness to pay 
credit card applications are evaluated using scoring models statistical evaluation models based on information obtained from applicants and credit bureaus 
the company s credit scoring systems include both industry and customized models using the company s criteria and historical data 
each cardmember s credit line is reviewed at least annually  and actions resulting from such review may include raising or lowering a cardmember s credit line or closing the account 
in addition  the company  on a portfolio basis  performs periodic monitoring and review of consumer behavior and risk profiles 
the company also reviews the creditworthiness of prospective discover business services merchants and conducts annual reviews of merchants with the greatest scrutiny given to merchants with substantial sales volume 
the company is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer  including sovereign governments and other entities  issuers located in a particular country or geographic area  public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operational risk operational risk refers generally to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s operating systems  and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions 
these transactions may cross multiple markets and involve different currencies 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
for example  the company s securities business has procedures that require that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the company s books and records and are confirmed on a timely basis  that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures  and that collateral and adequate documentation eg  master agreements are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances 
with respect to its consumer lending activities  the company manages operational risk through its system of internal controls which provides checks and balances to ensure that transactions and other account related activity eg  new account solicitation  transaction authorization and processing  billing and collection of delinquent accounts are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
disaster recovery plans are in place for critical systems on a company wide basis  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
the company also uses periodic self assessments and internal audit reviews as a further check on operational risk 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business 
the company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
the company  principally through the law and compliance department  also has established procedures that are designed to ensure that senior management s policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices are followed globally 
in connection with its businesses  the company has various procedures addressing issues  such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  new products  use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and recordkeeping 
the company also has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable  including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity  adequacy of legal documentation  the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies
