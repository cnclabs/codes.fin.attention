item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s business activities contain elements of risk 
the corporation considers a principal type of market risk to be valuation risk 
investments are stated at fair value as defined in the act and in the applicable regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
all assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors 
neither the corporation s investments nor an investment in the corporation is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
the corporation has exposure to public market price fluctuations to the extent of its publicly traded portfolio 
the corporation has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
the corporation expects that some of its venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
because there is typically no public market for the equity interests of the small companies in which the corporation invests  the valuation of the equity interests in the corporation s portfolio is subject to the estimate of the corporation s board of directors 
in making its determination  the board may consider valuation information provided by an independent third party or the investee corporation itself 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the corporation s portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in the corporation s consolidated statements of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments
