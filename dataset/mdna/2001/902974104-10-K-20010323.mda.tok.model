overview prior to june   our subsidiaries were organized into two divisions the wastewater division and the oilfield waste division 
however  as the result of our acquisition of romic environmental technologies corporation in january  effective as of july   we created a third division known as the industrial wastewater division  and changed the name of the wastewater division to the commercial wastewater division 
the industrial wastewater division currently includes the operations of romic environmental technologies corporation  us liquids of detroit  inc  us liquids of florida  inc 
and waste research and recovery  inc as a result of this change in management and reporting structure  previously reported segment information has been restated to reflect the current composition of each of the divisions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the commercial wastewater division collects  processes and disposes of nonhazardous liquid waste and recovers saleable by products from certain waste streams 
the industrial wastewater division collects  processes and disposes of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and recovers saleable by products from certain waste streams 
the oilfield waste division processes and disposes of waste generated in oil and gas exploration and production 
the commercial wastewater division generated million  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  this division derives revenues from two principal sources fees received for collecting  processing and disposing of nonhazardous liquid waste such as industrial wastewater  grease and grit trap waste  bulk liquids and dated beverages and revenue obtained from the sale of by products  including fats  oils  feed proteins  industrial and fuel grade ethanol  solvents  aluminum  glass  plastic and cardboard  recovered from certain waste streams 
some of our by product sales involve the brokering of industrial and fuel grade ethanol produced by third parties 
collection and processing fees charged to customers vary per gallon by waste stream according to the constituents of the waste  expenses associated with processing the waste and competitive factors 
by products are commodities and their prices fluctuate based on market conditions 
the industrial wastewater division generated million  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  this division derives revenues from fees charged to customers for collecting  processing and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous liquid waste such as household hazardous wastes  plating solutions  acids  flammable and reactive wastes  and industrial wastewater 
certain sludges and solid hazardous wastes are also processed 
the industrial wastewater division also generates revenues from the sale of by products recovered from certain waste streams  including industrial chemicals and recycled antifreeze products 
the fees charged for processing and disposing of hazardous waste vary significantly depending upon the constituents of the waste 
collection and processing fees charged with respect to nonhazardous liquid waste vary per gallon by waste stream according to the constituents of the waste  expenses associated with processing the waste and competitive factors 
the oilfield waste division generated million  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  this division derives revenues from fees charged to customers for processing and disposing of oil and gas exploration and production waste  and cleaning tanks  barges and other vessels and containers used in the storage and transportation of oilfield waste 
in order to match revenues with their related costs  when waste is unloaded at one of our sites  we recognize the related revenue and record a reserve for the estimated amount of expenses to be incurred to process and dispose of the waste 
as processing occurs  generally over nine to twelve months  the reserve is depleted as expenses are incurred 
our operating margins in the oilfield waste division are typically higher than in the commercial wastewater division and in the industrial wastewater division 
operating expenses include compensation and overhead related to operations workers  supplies and other raw materials  transportation charges  disposal fees paid to third parties  real estate lease payments and energy and insurance costs applicable to waste processing and disposal operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead relating to our corporate offices and each of our operating sites  as well as professional services and costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses relate to our landfarms and other depreciable or amortizable assets 
these assets are expensed over periods ranging from three to years 
amortization expenses relating to acquisitions have increased over time as a result of amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
the seasonal nature of certain of our operations may materially affect operating results 
accordingly  the operating results for any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent period 
special charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded special charges relating primarily to decisions to dispose of or suspend certain operations offset by the favorable effect of the settlement of a dispute 
these special charges amounted to a net expense before taxes of million 
the special charges included million for the estimated losses from the sale of certain operations of the commercial wastewater division  million for the closure of our re claim louisiana facility   for legal fees associated with such divestitures and closure  and an additional  for disposal of pcb contaminated materials at our detroit facility 
during this period  we also recognized net pre tax income of million relating to the termination of a disposal agreement with waste management that was entered into in may in connection with the acquisition of our detroit facility 
these special charges reduced net income by million net of taxes  due to valuation allowances  or per share 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements

the industrial wastewater division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
collection and processing fees generated million  or  and million  or  of the industrial wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from collection and processing of waste decreased million  or  due primarily to the temporary closing and subsequent recovery period at our detroit facility

the oilfield waste division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
the oilfield waste division s revenues increased million  or  due primarily to increased on shore drilling activity 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased from in to in this increase was due primarily to normal fixed costs at our detroit facility with a significant drop in revenues due to the shut down  and reduced margins on a major project in the beverage sector of the commercial wastewater division compared to a similar project in in addition  a larger than expected portion of the beverage business was attributable to the brokerage of ethanol  which is a very low margin producer 
this increase in operating expenses also reflects the continued growth of the commercial wastewater division  which has lower margins than the oilfield waste division 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased from in to in this increase was attributable primarily to the decrease in revenues at our detroit and re claim louisiana facilities without a proportionate decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this increase resulted primarily from increased legal fees  severance expenses associated with the resignation of a senior executive officer and the elimination of our market development department 
in addition  bad debt expense increased primarily at our texas locations largely as a result of a single customer who was the primary purchaser of grease from our texas grease processing locations 
interest and other expenses 
net interest and other expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from higher interest rates and  to a lesser extent  increased borrowings used to fund our working capital needs 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased approximately million  or  from million in to a benefit of million in as a result of decreased taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to a benefit rate of for the tax rate difference was due to the impact of nondeductible expenses on taxable income 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the commercial wastewater division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
collection and processing fees generated million  or  and million  or  of the commercial wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from collection and processing of waste increased million due to acquisitions completed in late and during by product sales generated the remaining million  or  and million  or  of the commercial wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of by products increased million  or  primarily as a result of the acquisition of royal recycling  ltd 
offset by the sale of the fats and oils distribution business in december the industrial wastewater division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
collection and processing fees generated million  or  and million  or  of the industrial wastewater division s revenues for and  respectively 
revenues from collection and processing of waste increased million due primarily to the acquisition of romic environmental 
by product sales generated the remaining million  or  of the industrial wastewater division s revenues for revenue from the sale of by products increased million as a result of the acquisition of romic environmental in january the increase in revenues of the industrial wastewater division would have been greater still but for the temporary closure of our detroit facility commencing on august  revenues from the detroit facility for the six month periods ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the oilfield waste division contributed million  or  of revenues and million  or  of revenues 
the oilfield waste division s revenues increased million  or  due primarily to the restructuring of our agreement with newpark resources  inc in september operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased from in to in this increase was due primarily to the continued growth of the commercial wastewater and industrial wastewater divisions  which have higher operating expenses than the oilfield waste division  without a proportionate decrease in operating expenses at our detroit facility 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased from in to in this increase was attributable primarily to the decrease in revenues from our detroit facility with no corresponding decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses 
this increase was also attributable to higher capital expenditures in  more acquisitions in and the timing of the acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in this increase resulted primarily from the decrease in revenues from our detroit facility without a proportionate decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest and other expenses 
net interest and other expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from interest expense incurred on borrowings used to fund the purchase price for acquisitions completed in and income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  from million in to million in as a result of decreased taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to a rate for the tax rate increase was due to the increased proportion of nondeductible expenses relative to pretax book income  as well as the recording of a valuation reserve on state tax losses generated at our re claim louisiana facility 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources consist of cash reserves  cash generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility 
we expect that these resources will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through january  however  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required sooner for our ongoing operations 
our revolving credit facility matures on february  and  therefore  by such date  we must either extend the term of our existing credit facility or obtain an alternative source of financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such an extension or alternative financing when required 
our capital requirements for continuing operations consist of our general working capital needs  scheduled principal payments on our debt obligations and capital leases  and planned capital expenditures 
operating cash flows cash flows from operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to a change in the company s accounts payable policy moving to a day pay cycle for most vendors 
the remainder of the change resulted from a million deferred income tax provision as of december  compared to a  deferred income tax benefit at december  and from increased depreciation and amortization 
we had net working capital of million at december   compared to net working capital of million at december  this increase in working capital was due primarily to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets see note to our consolidated financial statements  partially offset by an overall decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our allowance for bad debts decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to two factors 
first  due to the temporary closing of our detroit facility in  certain customers were not paying the amounts owed to us 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we provided approximately  for uncollectible receivables 
essentially all of this allowance was utilized in as these accounts were written off 
second  during  we continued to perform a detailed review of our receivable balances at all of our locations and wrote off all of those accounts deemed uncollectible 
at december   we had a million reserve to provide for the cost of future closures of facilities 
the amount of this unfunded reserve is based on the estimated total cost to close the facilities as calculated in accordance with the applicable regulations 
regulatory agencies require us to post financial assurance to assure that all waste will be treated and the facilities closed appropriately 
we have in place a total of million of financial assurance in the form of letters of credit and bonds to provide for the cost of future closings of facilities 
as of december   we also had a million unfunded reserve to provide for the costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at our facility in east palo alto  california  and our share of the costs to remediate drum reconditioning or disposal sites previously used by our subsidiaries 
in  we expect to pay approximately  of remediation reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded special charges relating primarily to decisions to dispose of or suspend certain operations offset by the favorable effect of the settlement of a dispute 
these special charges amounted to a net expense before taxes of million 
the special charges included million for the estimated losses from the sale of certain operations of the commercial wastewater division  million for the closure of our re claim louisiana facility   for legal fees associated with such divestitures and closure  and an additional  for disposal of pcb contaminated materials at our detroit facility 
during this period  we also recognized net pre tax income of million relating to the termination of a disposal agreement with waste management that was entered into in may in connection with the acquisition of our detroit facility 
these special charges reduced net income by million net of taxes  due to valuation allowances  or per share 
all reserves have been recorded and we do not anticipate any significant charges through december the majority of the charges are non cash with a total of  of special charges and million of special charges in accrued liabilities 
we anticipate the majority of these remaining charges will be paid in see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
all costs  except potential fines or penalties  incurred or expected to be incurred in connection with the investigation of our detroit facility have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  due to the current status of the investigation  we are unable at this time to project a reasonable estimate of potential fines or penalties or range of potential fines or penalties that could be assessed against the facility 
accordingly  we cannot project the ultimate outcome of the investigation or its potential impact on us 
the imposition of a substantial fine or penalty against the facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in  we expect to pay approximately million in legal fees relating to regulatory proceedings and on going litigation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
operating cash flows from continuing operations are anticipated to be approximately million 
this amount is net of all projected interest costs and expected payments on special charge reserves  and does not include any provision for potential fines and penalties or legal settlements which have not yet occurred or been accrued 
operating cash flow will be a primary source of funding our capital budget in remaining amounts will be used to reduce outstanding debts 
investing activities capital expenditures made during for our continuing operations were million 
the majority of the capital expenditures were for plant expansions  equipment and vehicle upgrades 
capital expenditures for our continuing operations for are estimated at approximately million  which includes capital expenditures for businesses that we anticipate selling in approximately million of this amount is scheduled to be invested in the commercial wastewater division for vehicles and plant expansions 
approximately million is scheduled to be invested in the industrial wastewater division for plant improvements and expansion and equipment 
approximately  is budgeted for equipment and injection wells for the oilfield waste division 
the remaining  will be used for software and computer upgrades at our corporate headquarters 
in certain of our acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration to the owners of the acquired business if the future pre tax earnings of the acquired business exceed certain negotiated levels or other specified events occur 
to the extent that any contingent consideration is required to be paid in connection with an acquisition  we anticipate that the related incremental cash flows of the acquired business will be sufficient to pay the cash component of the contingent consideration 
during  the former owners of two businesses that we acquired in are entitled to receive additional consideration totalling million if the acquired businesses satisfy certain targeted performance levels 
management does not expect either of the acquired businesses to meet these targets and  therefore  we do not anticipate paying any earn outs in for  we expect to generate million net proceeds from the sale of assets 
upon receipt  these funds will be used to reduce the debt balance on our credit facility and are not needed to fund ongoing operations 
financing activities at december   approximately million of principal payments on debt obligations were payable during the next twelve months 
million of these payments represent our expected proceeds from operations held for sale as discussed above  the receipt of which will require concurrent payments on our credit facility 
the remaining million of principal payments due are expected to be funded from operating cash flows  which net of budgeted capital expenditures is expected to be approximately million 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks under which we may borrow to fund working capital requirements 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility  which matures on february   contains affirmative  negative and subjective covenants  prohibits the payment of dividends and requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
as previously announced  our fourth quarter results caused us to be out of compliance with certain of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
effective march   the terms of the credit facility were amended to  among other things  reduce the amount of the credit facility from million to million  limit the total amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility to million except with the approval of the banks  reduce the amount of secured debt that we may owe to third parties from million to million  limit the amount of capital expenditures that we may make in any fiscal year  increase the interest rates payable under the credit facility  prohibit future acquisitions by the company without the banks consent  and to waive our noncompliance with and modify the terms of certain of our financial covenants 
the terms of our amended credit facility have significantly limited our ability to enter into leases or new debts outside the facility 
the capital expenditures budgeted for are less than the capital expenditures permitted by the credit facility 
as a result of the march amendments  the amount of the credit facility will be permanently reduced by million on each of july  and december  in addition  unless the amount of the credit facility has previously or concurrently been reduced by at least million  the amount of the credit facility will be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds received by the company from any sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business  any issuance of equity other than any equity issued under the employee stock purchase plan  the issuance of certain debt  or any settlement of our lawsuit against national steel corporation 
reductions of the credit facility made as a result of any such sale of assets  issuance of equity or debt  or settlement with national steel corporation will be applied against the reductions of the credit facility scheduled to be made on july  and december  after such time as the amount of the credit facility has been reduced to million  the amount of the credit facility will be permanently reduced by an amount equal to one hundred percent of the net cash proceeds received from any sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business and fifty percent of the net cash proceeds received by the company from any issuance of equity other than any equity issued under the employee stock purchase plan  the issuance of certain debt  or any settlement with national steel corporation 
the outstanding balance under the credit facility has been classified as long term as of december  however  because the credit facility matures on february   we have classified the outstanding debt balance under the facility as a current liability as of february  prior to the maturity of the credit facility  we must either extend the term of the credit facility or obtain an alternative source of financing 
the debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility may be accelerated by the lenders if  among other things  a change in control of the company occurs or michael p 
lawlor or earl j 
blackwell ceases to serve as an executive officer of the company and is not replaced within sixty days by an individual reasonably satisfactory to the lenders 
at march   we had borrowed approximately million under the credit facility 
advances under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor  in each case  plus a margin which is calculated quarterly based upon our ratio of indebtedness to cash flows 
as of march   amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accruing interest at approximately per year 
by march   this rate is expected to decrease to due to the re setting of interest rates on certain of our libor based notes 
during  we had a million credit facility with bankboston  na under which we were able to borrow funds to purchase equipment 
the commitment for this facility expired on december   at which time we had borrowed approximately million 
this amount is being repaid in monthly installments of principal and interest at 
in september  we repurchased and immediately cancelled  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
operations held for sale during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors voted to sell certain non core operations of the commercial wastewater division 
the types of liquid waste managed at these facilities include industrial wastewaters  biosolids and grease and grit trap waste 
as of december   the carrying value of these assets was written down to the fair value thereof less estimated costs to sell 
because we intend to dispose of these assets during and because our revolving credit facility requires us to pay to the banks the net cash proceeds of all such sales  as of december   the operations held for sale have been classified as current and the net cash proceeds expected to be received from such sales have been classified as current maturities of long term obligations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  notes and capital leases payable  and debt obligations 
the book value of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term notes payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we estimate that the fair value of all of our debt obligations including debt associated with operations held for sale approximates million as of december  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our obligations under our revolving credit facility 
as of both december  and march   million and million had been borrowed under the revolving credit facility and the equipment credit facility  respectively 
as of march   amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were accruing interest at approximately per year and amounts outstanding under the equipment credit facility were accruing interest at approximately per year 
by march   amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are expected to be accruing interest at approximately due to the re setting of interest rates on certain of our libor based notes 
a ten percent increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debts outstanding as of march  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  assuming the amount of debt outstanding remains constant 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in revenue volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above
