certain factors certain information contained in this form k contains forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities exchange act of and the regulations thereunder  including without limitation  statements as to the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and statements as to management s beliefs  expectations or options 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and may be affected by various factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed in item business  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and those set forth below 
rapid technological change 
the microwave test and measurement industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability continually to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers and the technological advancements of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company does not currently have any material patents and relies principally on trade secret and copyright laws to protect its technology 
however  there can be no assurance that these steps will prevent misappropriation of its technology 
moreover  third parties could independently develop technologies that compete with the company s technologies 
although the company believes that its products and proprietary rights do not infringe patents and proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims  regardless of merit  will not be asserted against the company 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection of the company s proprietary technology may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
risks associated with acquisitions 
in the normal course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions that would complement or expand its business 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate the business and operations of any business acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur disruptions and unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in attempting to make acquisitions  the company often competes with other potential acquirers  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
furthermore  the process of evaluating  negotiating  financing and integrating acquisitions may divert management time and resources 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition  when consummated  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
dependence on alchut  operations in israel 
the company maintains and will continue to maintain a number of relationships with alchut  the major stockholder of the company 
alchut is the company s principal subcontractor for electro mechanical production  primarily in connection with the production of positioners 
in addition  alchut provides general and administrative services for the company s operations in israel 
effective january   the company and alchut entered into an agreement under which alchut will continue to provide these services for at least one year 
alchut maintains its production operations  and the company maintains part of its engineering operations  in israel 
as a result  the company may be directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
risks of fixed price contracts 
virtually all of the company s contracts for its systems and products are on a fixed price basis 
the profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of completion 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems in engineering  design or testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any one contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with entering new markets 
the company has identified and is evaluating whether to enter into certain complementary markets 
the company s success in these markets will depend on  among other factors  the company s ability to identify markets and develop technologies for such markets on a timely basis  hire and retain skilled management  financial  marketing and engineering personnel  successfully manage growth and obtain capital sufficient to finance such expansion 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully enter these markets 
management of growth 
the company believes that growth will be required to maintain the company s competitive position 
future growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on its management  administrative  operating and financial resources  as well as increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s ability to manage future growth will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis  to implement new systems as necessary and to expand  train  motivate and manage its sales and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its growth successfully 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with international sales 
in and  international sales comprised approximately and of the company s total sales  and the company expects its international business to continue to account for a material part of its revenues 
international sales are subject to numerous risks  including political and economic instability in foreign markets  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  inconsistent product regulation by foreign agencies or governments  imposition of product tariffs and burdens and costs of complying with a wide variety of international and us export laws and regulatory requirements 
the non discretionary three year denial policy for munitions list items stemming from the us customs plea agreement  further restricts future exports 
this action was materially limited  when on march   the state department notified the company that it s commodities jurisdiction request submitted in was approved 
the approval removes the vast majority of the company s antenna measurement software products and systems from the u 
s munitions list 
these products now fall under the jurisdiction of the commerce department and therefore would not be subject to the state department s non discretionary policy of denying license applications 
although the export process will become much more efficient under commerce regulations effective march   there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in international markets or that its international sales will be profitable 
approximately of the company s sales in were denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the company believes that it does not have significant exposure to fluctuations in currency 
however  fluctuations in currency could adversely affect the company s customers 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results have varied from quarter to quarter in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on factors such as the size and timing of significant contracts  the mix of third party products and the company s proprietary products included in a particular contract  customers budgetary constraints  increased competition  the timing of new product announcements and changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in operating expenses and changes in general economic factors and export license delays and denials 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue levels 
if the company s revenue levels were to be below expectations  the company s operating results would likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on qualified technical personnel 
the company s operating results depend in large part upon the efforts of its microwave  software and systems engineers 
the success of the company s business therefore depends on its ability to attract and retain engineers and other technical personnel 
there are a limited number of microwave engineers  and such individuals are sought both by microwave test and measurement companies such as the company and by manufacturers of wireless products and telecommunications service providers 
competition for such personnel is intense 
the company has at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining technical personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties in the future in attracting and in retaining technical personnel 
dependence on key personnel 
the success of the company depends to a significant degree upon the contribution of its executive officers and other key personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its managerial and other key personnel or to attract additional managerial and other key personnel if required 
product liability  risk of product defects 
the sale of products and systems by the company may entail the risk of product liability and related claims 
a product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
complex software and system products  such as those offered by the company  may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
the company maintains product liability insurance in the amount of million and errors and omissions insurance in the amount of million  although there can be no assurance that such coverage will be applicable to a particular claim or that the amounts of such insurance will be adequate if the company experiences a significant claim 
although the company has not experienced any significant claims to date related to its systems or products  the occurrence of such a claim could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the market for automated microwave test and measurement products  systems and services is highly competitive and is characterized by continuing advances in products and technologies 
in general  competition in this market comes from major microwave test and measurement vendors  some of which have a longer operating history  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than the company 
these companies also have established relationships with current and potential customers of the company 
the company also competes  on a limited basis  with the internal development groups of its existing and potential customers  who may design and develop parts of their own microwave test and measurement systems 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by such competition 
fluctuations in capital spending 
the company is dependent upon the wireless communications  satellite  automotive and aerospace defense industries 
because these industries are characterized by technological change  pricing and gross margin pressure and  particularly in the aerospace defense industry  government budget constraints  they have from time to time experienced sudden economic downturns 
during these periods  capital spending is frequently curtailed and the number of design projects often decreases 
since the company s sales are dependent upon capital spending trends and new design projects  negative factors affecting these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
no dividends 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate that any cash dividends will be declared or paid in the foreseeable future 
issuance of preferred stock and common stock  anti takeover provisions 
pursuant to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation  the company has an authorized class of  shares of preferred stock which may be issued by the board of directors with such terms and such rights  preferences and designations as the board may determine and without any vote of the stockholders  unless otherwise required by law 
issuance of such preferred stock  depending upon the rights  preferences and designations thereof  may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company 
issuance of additional shares common stock could result in dilution of the voting power of the common stock purchased in this offering 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law among other things  may restrict the ability of the stockholders to approve a merger or business combination or obtain control of the company
