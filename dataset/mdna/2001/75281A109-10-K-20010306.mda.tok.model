item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
factors affecting financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources during  the company spent million on development  exploration and acquisitions 
debt including trust preferred decreased by million to million 
debt including trust preferred and preferred decreased by million  including million face value of preferred retired at a discount 
at december   the company had million in cash  total assets of million and a debt including trust preferred to capitalization ratio of 
the unused borrowing base available at december  was million on the credit facility  million on the great lakes facility and million on the ipf facility 

table of contents long term debt including trust preferred at december  totaled million and included million of borrowings under the credit facility  million under the non recourse great lakes facility  million under the non recourse ipf facility  million of senior subordinated notes  million of convertible subordinated debentures and million of trust preferred 
during  million shares of common stock were exchanged for million of trust preferred and million of debentures 
a million extraordinary gain net of costs was recorded as the trust preferred and debentures were acquired at a discount 
in addition  million shares of common stock were exchanged for million of the preferred 
in september  the company decided to sell the sterling plant and reduced its carrying value to estimated fair value through an impairment of million 
the sale of the plant in june resulted in an additional  loss 
the company currently believes its capital resources are adequate to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain planned capital expenditures 
cash flow the company s principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
decreases in prices and lower production at certain properties reduced cash flow sharply in and early and resulted in the reduction of the company s borrowing base 
the company has entered into hedging agreements covering approximately and of its anticipated production on an mcfe basis for and  respectively 
simultaneously  the company sharply reduced its development and exploration spending 
while the million of capital expenditures for were funded entirely with internal cash flow  the amount expended was not sufficient to replace production 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations increased as higher prices  a decrease in direct operating costs and lower interest expense more than offset the decline in production and increasing general and administrative expenses 
net cash used in provided by investing in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in  a million source of cash from the formation of great lakes  million in asset sales and million of ipf receipts  more than offset additions to oil and gas properties and ipf investments 
in  million of additions to oil and gas properties  offset by million proceeds from sales of assets and million of ipf repayments were included 
net cash provided by used in financing in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  recourse debt decreased by million and total debt including trust preferred decreased by million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets to debt repayment and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities 
the amount of trust preferred outstanding decreased million in and million in due to exchanges of such securities into common stock 
capital requirements during  million of capital was expended  primarily on development projects 
this represented approximately of internal cash flow 
the company manages its capital budget with the goal 
table of contents of funding it with internal cash flow 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  management expects such activities to be maintained at levels below internal cash flow 
remaining cash flow should be available for debt reduction 
see business development and exploration activities 
bank facilities the credit facility is secured by oil and gas properties 
at march   the borrowing base on the credit facility was million of which million was available 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination each april and october  as well as under special circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  including the lenders discounted present value of estimated future net cash flow from production 
borrowing base redeterminations resulting in no change or a decrease require approval of of the lenders  redeterminations which result in an increase require approval 
the company expects to further reduce bank borrowings in the coming year with internal cash flow and  possibly  asset sales 
during  the company sold properties and used million of proceeds to reduce bank borrowings 
there are currently no agreements to sell any material assets 
the company consolidates of amounts outstanding under great lakes s million revolving bank facility 
the great lakes facility is non recourse to range 
the great lakes facility provides for a borrowing base which is subject to semi annual redetermination and is secured by substantially all of the joint venture s assets 
at march   great lakes borrowing base was million  of which million was available 
the borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations in april and october 
borrowing base redeterminations require the approval of all lenders 
ipf maintains a million revolving credit facility 
the ipf facility is secured by substantially all of ipf s assets and is non recourse to range 
ipf s borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination in april and october 
on march   the ipf borrowing base was million  of which million was available 
oil and gas hedging the company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
all such contracts are entered into solely to hedge price and to limit volatility 
the company s current policy is to hedge between and of its production on a rolling twelve to eighteen month basis 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil at prices ranging from to per mmbtu averaging and from to per barrel averaging 
while these transactions have no carrying value  their fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be required to terminate them  was a net loss of million and million at december   and february   respectively 
the contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately of anticipated production and of production 
gains or losses on hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included in oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
net gains losses relating to these derivatives in  and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
effective january   the gains losses in these hedging positions will be recorded at fair value on the company s balance sheet as other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
in june  the company repriced bcf of existing gas hedges upwards from an average price of to per mmbtu to conserve cash 
in exchange for such repricing  the company hedged an average of  mmbtu per day from april through march at an average price of per mmbtu 
while the company s payment requirement relating to the repriced hedges was affected  under generally accepted accounting principles the million of estimated net losses deferred were recorded as if no 
table of contents repricing had occurred 
a deferred loss and associated liability of million were recorded on the balance sheet at june   of which  and  remained at december   respectively 
the imputed interest cost associated with the repricing was  interest rate hedging at december   range had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates which averaged at year end at december   the company had million of borrowings subject to an interest rate swap agreement based on day libor of expiring in october the agreement requires the company to pay the counterparty interest at the above fixed swap rate and requires the counterparty to pay the company interest at the day libor rate 
in addition  great lakes had four interest rate swap agreements totaling million 
two agreements totaling million at rates of each expire in may two agreements of million each at and expire in december the agreements expiring in may and december may be terminated at the counterparty s option in may and december  respectively 
the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest 
capital restructuring program as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company took a number of steps beginning in to strengthen its financial position  including the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for fixed rate securities 
these initiatives resulted in reducing parent company bank debt to million and total debt including trust preferred to million at december  while management believes these steps have stabilized the company s financial position  debt remains too high 
for the company to return to its historical posture of consistent profitability and growth  management believes it necessary to further reduce debt 
the company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its obligations 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues and the value of its assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also dependent on oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas after hedging 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the company 
should conditions in the oil industry remain favorable  inflationary pressures specific to the industry have and may continue to accelerate 

table of contents results of operations the following table identifies certain unusual items included in net income  and presents net income excluding the effect of such items 
the table should be read in conjunction with the following discussions of results of operations 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss as reported     impact of hedging  net    unusual items provisions for impairment  net of tax    restructuring costs  gain loss from asset sales    gain on sale great lakes  net of tax  gain on retirement of debt   reversal of tax provision  reversal of ipf valuation allowances  as adjusted     based on oil and gas hedging contracts in place at december   an additional million of comprehensive loss would be recognized at december  had sfas no 
been in effect on that date 
comparison of to net income in totaled million  compared to a net loss of million in net income excluding the impact of hedging losses and unusual items would have been million in versus a net loss of million in production fell to  mcfe per day  a decrease from a decrease would have been reported if the impact of the effect of the great lakes transaction were eliminated 
revenues benefited from a increase in average prices per mcfe to  partially offset by the production decrease 
the average prices received for oil increased to per barrel and for gas increased to per mcf 
production expenses fell to million largely as a result of the great lakes transaction and asset divestitures 
the operating cost per mcfe produced averaged in versus in due to production taxes and workovers 
transportation  processing and marketing revenues decreased to million 
the benefit to processing revenues of higher ngl prices was more than offset by the impact of the sterling gas plant sale in april ipf s million of revenues consisted of the return portion of its royalties and a million net reversal of valuation allowances previously provided 
ipf s income rose over that reported in during  ipf expenses included million of administrative costs and million of interest 
exploration expense increased to million  primarily due to higher dry hole costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased to million 
the increase was primarily due to lower recoupments from third parties for operations which fell due to the great lakes transaction and the expense of establishing duplicate financial and administrative departments in fort worth 
interest and other income decreased million primarily due to million of losses on sales of assets 
interest expense excluding ipf decreased to million primarily as a result of the lower outstandings  partially offset by higher interest rates 
see the discussion of ipf interest expense in note the average outstanding balance on the bank credit facility fell to million from million in the prior year as the weighted average interest rate rose to from 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a decreased as a result of the mix of production and lower production 
the company wide depletion rate rose to per mcfe compared to in as determined based on ending reserves and the costs associated with them 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether there has been an impairment 
if an impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized 
the company compares the carrying value of its unproved properties to their estimated fair value based on a variety of factors  including a geological and engineering assessment of the area and other acreage transactions in the vicinity 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised its dd a rate to per mcfe to reflect a decline in future proved reserves and the cost of properties subject to amortization 
reserves were revised downward in due to the removal of drilling and recompletion locations that  based on perceived risk  will probably not be drilled 
see note to the financial statements 
the company currently estimates that its dd a rate for will approximate per mcfe 
the company s high dd a rate will make it more difficult to remain profitable if commodity prices fall sharply 
comparison of to the company reported a net loss for of million  compared to a net loss of million in net losses excluding the impact of hedging and unusual items would have been million in compared to million in oil and gas revenues increased to million 
during the year  production increased to bcfe  an average of  mcfe per day 
the increased revenues recognized from production were partially offset by a decline in the average price received of per mcfe 
the average oil price increased to per barrel while the average gas price decreased to per mcf 
in  the company sold bcf of gas under an above market contract to a utility at an average price of per mcf 
had this gas been sold at the average price in the region approximately per mcf  gas revenues would have been million lower 
the gas contract expired in mid as a result of the company s larger base of producing properties  production expenses increased to million in the average operating cost per mcfe produced was in and in transportation  processing and marketing revenues increased to million due to higher production levels 
ipf income of million consisted of the return portion of its royalties net of a million allowance for bad debts 
during  ipf income expenses included million of administrative expenses and million of interest 
exploration expense decreased to million in during  the company sharply reduced exploration expenditures to help reduce indebtedness and limit risk 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in as compared to in the decrease was due to an overhead reduction program implemented in late and the benefits of sharing certain services with great lakes 
interest and other income decreased million to  primarily due to million of losses on asset sales 
the million gain on sale in represented the proportional gain recognized on the 
table of contents great lakes transaction as described in note interest expense increased to million primarily a result of the higher outstandings and higher interest rates 
average outstandings on the credit facility were million and million for and  respectively and the weighted average interest rates were and 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased from the prior year due to higher production and lower proved reserves 
the company wide depletion increased from 
per mcfe in to per mcfe in in the third quarter of  the company recognized a million impairment on a gas processing plant located in the permian basin upon deciding to sell the plant and related assets 
the net book value of the plant was classified as a current asset at december  on the balance sheet see note dispositions 
during  the company recorded million of depreciation expense for the first nine months on this plant 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an impairment of million on unproved acreage value 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether an impairment is indicated 
if it is  a loss is recognized 
the company compares the carrying value of its unproved properties to its estimate of their fair value 
the assessment of fair value is based on various factors including a geological and engineering assessment of the area and acreage transactions in the vicinity 
in the fourth quarter of  the company again adjusted its dd a rate upward to per mcfe to reflect decreasing reserves 
reserves were revised downward based on in depth field studies which showed sharper declines in production and reservoir pressures than previously expected 
comparison of to the company reported a net loss of million in  as compared to a net loss of million in excluding the impact of hedging and unusual items  net loss for would have been million and net income for would be million 
due to downward engineering revisions on certain of its properties and  to a lesser degree  depressed energy prices  the company recorded an impairment of million million after tax as well as million million after tax of valuation allowances on ipf receivables 
the company initiated a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
in connection with the cost reduction program  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax relating to severance and other matters 
oil and gas revenues increased to million 
production increased to bcfe  an average of mmcfe per day 
the increased production revenues were partially offset by a decrease in the average price received per mcfe to 
the average oil price decreased to per barrel and average gas prices decreased to per mcf 
during  the company sold bcf of gas to a utility under an above market gas contract at an average price of per mcf 
had this gas been sold at the average price available in the region per mcf  gas revenues would have decreased million 
as a result of a larger base of producing properties  production expenses increased to million in versus million in the average operating cost per mcfe produced was in both periods 
transportation  processing and marketing revenues decreased to million principally due to the sale of a gas processing plant in the san juan basin and a drop in ngl prices which lowered processing revenues 
ipf income of million was recorded for the four months it was owned 
its expenses during this period included 
million of administrative costs  million of interest and a million of valuation allowances for bad debts 
exploration expense increased to million due to higher seismic and dry hole costs 
in  million was spent on dry holes compared to only  of such costs in general and administrative expenses increased to million 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase was due to higher personnel costs and increased legal expenses 
in december  the company implemented an overhead reduction program in response to its poor performance and falling energy prices 
the cuts included the termination of employees  representing of non field staff 

table of contents interest and other income decreased to million primarily due to lower profits on assets sales 
interest expense increased to million primarily as a result of the higher outstandings due to acquisitions and drilling 
average outstandings on the credit facility were million and million for and  respectively  and the weighted average interest rates were and 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased compared to as a result of increased production 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average depletion rate per mcfe 
the company wide depletion rate was per mcfe in and 
per mcfe in in  the company recorded million of depletion expense on properties classified as assets held for sale at year end 
in  the company recorded a sizeable impairment against its oil and gas properties as a result of poor performance and  to a lesser extent  lower oil and gas prices 
the following properties were impaired during in thousands properties impairment southwest  gulf coast offshore  gulf coast onshore  appalachia  marketable securities  total  year range experienced no material problems relating to the year issues 
the company s significant suppliers  customers and service providers have been able to transact business on a normal basis in the total cost for the year projects approximated  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about range s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how range views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
all of range s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
commodity price risk 
range s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to us natural gas production 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
range periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through financial swaps whereby range will receive a fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
these financial hedging activities are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of these hedges are recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered 
range does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents as of december   range had oil and gas hedges in place covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
while these transactions have no carrying value  their fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be required to terminate them  was a net loss of million at december  due to the decline in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  subsequent to year end  the fair market value of these hedge transactions was a net loss of million at february  the contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately of anticipated production and of production 
gains or losses on hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included in oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
net gains losses relating to these derivatives in  and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
effective january   the gains losses in these hedging positions will be recorded at fair value on the company s balance sheet as other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
the company seeks to reduce the volatility of its oil and gas revenue through hedging transactions 
should the price of a commodity decline  the revenue received from the sale of the product tends to decline to a corresponding extent 
the decline in revenue is then partially offset based on the amount of production hedged and the hedge price 
in  a reduction in oil and gas prices would have reduced revenue by million  offset by a reduction in hedging losses of million 
if oil and gas future prices at december  had declined by  the hedging loss exposure at that date would have been reduced by million 
at december   range had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
the remaining million of debt bears interest at floating rates which averaged for the year then ended 
at december   the company had million of borrowings subject to an interest rate swap agreement at which expires in october the agreement requires that the company pay the counterparty interest at the above rate and requires the counterparty to pay the company interest at the day libor rate 
in addition  great lakes had four interest rate swap agreements totaling million 
two agreements totaling million at rates of each expire in may two agreements of million each at and expire in december the agreements expiring in may and december may be terminated at the counterparty s option in may and december  respectively 
on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest
