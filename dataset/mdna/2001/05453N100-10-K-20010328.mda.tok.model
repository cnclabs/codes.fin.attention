net income loss product sales product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of dsl equipment and compression software products 
the products that comprise dsl equipment sales are primarily test and development systems and modems 
product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of modems 
modem revenue was lower because we have almost completely phased out the development and sale of our x access router 
we anticipate that sales of x products will be minimal in future periods 
product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a substantial increase in the sale of dsl test and development systems in dsl test and development system revenue increased primarily because i more customers are developing chipsets and equipment using our dsl technology  and consequently they purchased more of these systems in  and ii we made new products available in  including our veritas and veritas products 
the increase in product sales was also  to a lesser degree  due to higher revenue from the sale of compression software products 
compression software revenue increased primarily because our oem customers shipped more of our software in their products in contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of license and engineering service fees that we receive under agreements with our customers to develop adsl chipsets 
contract revenue in and also includes revenue from us government research contracts 
contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar increase is primarily due to new chipset development projects with existing and new semiconductor customers 
continued growth of the dsl market encouraged existing and new customers to seek our technology and engineering assistance for their dsl chipset products  which caused contract revenue to increase in contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a substantial increase in contract revenue from our semiconductor manufacturer customers 
higher contract revenue from semiconductor customers was mostly due to the addition of new projects with existing and new customers 
we believe the growing dsl market opportunity encouraged more semiconductor companies to enter the market in the dollar increase in dsl contract revenue was partially offset by a decline in us government research revenue 
we completed our last us government research project in the first quarter of we anticipate that revenue from these government contracts will not continue in future periods 
royalties royalties consist of royalty payments that we receive under licensing agreements 
we receive royalties from customers for the right to use our technology in their chipsets or solutions 
royalties increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties increased from in to in the increase in royalties was primarily due to a sharp increase in adsl chipset sales in in general and the success of adi  our largest customer  in particular 
we believe that this increase was driven by growing deployments of adsl service primarily in the us and korea 
we do not expect royalties in to grow at the rate at which they grew in royalties increased from  in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties increased from in to in we believe that the increase in royalties was primarily due to growing deployments of adsl services by the telecommunications industry in general  and of deployments using our technology in particular 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consists primarily of the cost of equipment sales as the cost of compression software sales is minimal 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in the decrease in cost of product sales dollars and the improvement in product margins is primarily due to a lower percentage of lower margin x modem sales in cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in the percentage of compression software revenue in the product sales mix was approximately the same in and therefore  the improvement in the gross margin is primarily due to lower cost of sales on equipment 
cost of product sales for equipment only as a percentage of equipment sales was in as compared to in the improvement in equipment gross margins is primarily due to a larger percentage of higher margin test and development system revenue in the sales mix  and a reduction of obsolescence provisions in cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities associated with customer development projects 
cost of contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to new chipset development projects with existing and new semiconductor customers  and the nature of the customer projects we performed in we have engaged in a more diverse collection of projects in involving asic application specific integrated circuit core developments  specific dsp based code developments  and developments involving the combination of asic cores and dsp code 
these projects tend to have greater development costs associated with them 
cost of contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar increase is primarily due to the addition of new projects with existing and new semiconductor and equipment customers 
increased spending related to telecommunications projects was partially offset by almost no spending on us government research projects in research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities related to engineering projects to enhance and extend our telecommunications intellectual property offerings  and our compression software technology 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense increased from in to in the dollar increase in spending was primarily due to increased spending on non customer specific research and development projects  including voice enabled dsl  dr 
dsl and dmtflex 
higher spending on these projects was partially offset by lower spending on our x modem product 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease in spending was primarily due to lower spending on our x modem product and our discrete wavelet multitone dwmt chipset project 
lower spending on these projects was partially offset by higher spending on our veritas test and development products and compression software research and development 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  travel  advertising and promotion  recruiting  and facilities expense 
sales and marketing expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower spending on public relations 
sales and marketing expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing costs because of the reduction in focus on end user modem sales 
prior to the second quarter of  we were pursuing a technology licensing strategy as well as an end user modem distribution and sales strategy 
sales and marketing expenses in included some non recurring costs that we incurred to better align the sales organization to execute on a licensing strategy 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  facilities costs  and public company  bad debt  legal  and audit expenses 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the dollar increase is primarily due to higher administration  investor relations and bad debt expenses 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the dollar increase is primarily due to higher public company expenses and additions to our legal and administrative staffs 
other income other income consists of rental income from real estate leases for space in our headquarters building  which terminated in the first quarter of other income decreased from  in to  in to zero in the dollar decrease is due to the termination of the leases in january  and we anticipate that we will not have any more rental income in the future 
interest income interest income increased from million in to million in the dollar increase is primarily due to higher cash balances 
higher cash balances were due to positive cash flows from operations and stock option exercises during interest income increased from million in to million in the dollar increase is primarily due to higher cash balances 
higher cash balances were due to positive cash flows from operations and stock option exercises during income taxes we made no provision for income taxes in or as our historical net losses have resulted in tax loss carryforwards that we used to offset any tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that based on our continuing profitability  it was more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our tax assets 
accordingly  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million at december   which consisted of an income statement tax benefit of million for tax loss carryforwards and research and development credits  and an adjustment to additional paid in capital of million for stock option related deductions 
the tax assets as of december  for which we have recorded a valuation allowance are attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit of these items will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized 
consequently  to the extent we are profitable in future periods  we anticipate that we will record income tax expense 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in  and federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in at december   we also had available state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in  and state research and development and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january  we changed our method of revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
previously  we recognized contract revenue under multiple element agreements upon completion of contract milestones or upon transfer of intellectual property 
under the accounting method we adopted retroactive to january   we now recognize contract revenue under multiple element agreements by recording total license and engineering fees for the entire contract on a straight line basis over the estimated contract performance period  subject to the limitation that cumulative revenue through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments through that same period 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  liquidity and capital resources since our inception in march  we have financed our activities primarily through the sale of stock 
in the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million  million and million  respectively 
our operating activities provided net cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations during and was primarily due to our profitability 
operating activities used net cash of million in the year ended december   which was primarily due to operating losses and working capital requirements 
in the years ended december    and  we made capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in all three years consist of spending on computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment  and furniture used principally in engineering activities 
capital spending in also included the renovation of the third floor of our headquarters building for million 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results some of the information in this form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  continue and similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future operating results or financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
however  we may not be able to predict future events accurately 
the risk factors listed in this section  as well as any cautionary language in this form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form k could materially and adversely affect our business 
our quarterly results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall significantly 
many of our expenses  such as employee compensation and facilities costs  are relatively fixed 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue increases 
as a result  any shortfalls in revenue in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses 
other factors  many of which are outside our control  also could cause variations in our quarterly revenue and operating results 
some of these factors are o the rate of market acceptance of dsl broadband access  generally  and of our adsl technologies in particular  o demand for our licensees chipsets and products that incorporate our technology  o development by us or our competitors of enhanced or alternative high speed network access technologies  o the extent and timing of new license transactions  o regulatory developments  and o the timing and related costs of any acquisitions 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenue and operating results to predict our future performance 
we have a unique business model the success of our business model depends upon i our ability to license our technology to semiconductor and equipment companies  and ii our customers willingness and ability to sell products that incorporate our technology so that we may receive significant royalties that are consistent with our plans and expectations 
obtaining suitable licensees for our technology is difficult because of the following features of our strategy o we typically undergo a lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee before entering into an agreement  o we must persuade semiconductor and equipment manufacturers with significant resources to rely on us for critical technology on an ongoing basis rather than trying to develop similar technology internally  and o we must persuade potential licensees to bear development costs associated with our technology applications and to make the necessary investment to successfully produce chipsets and products using our technology 
moreover  the success of our business model also depends on the receipt of royalties from licensees 
royalties from our licensees are often based on the selling prices of our licensees chipsets and products  over which we have little or no control 
we also have little or no control over our licensees promotional and marketing efforts 
our licensees are not obligated to use our technology  and generally are not required to pay us royalties unless they do use our technology 
they are not prohibited from competing against us 
our business could be seriously harmed if o we cannot obtain suitable licensees  o our licensees fail to achieve significant sales of chipsets or products incorporating our technology  or o we otherwise fail to implement our business strategy successfully 
we depend substantially on a limited number of licensees there are a relatively limited number of semiconductor and equipment companies to which we can license our dsl technology in a manner consistent with our business model 
if we fail to maintain relationships with our current licensees or fail to establish a sufficient number of new licensee relationships  our business could be seriously harmed 
also  we cannot assure you that our prospective customers will not use their superior size and bargaining power to demand license terms that are unfavorable to us 
we derive a significant amount of revenue from one customer in  we derived of our total revenue from analog devices  inc adi was the first customer to license adsl technology from us in and their chipsets are the most mature implementations of our technology in the market 
our royalty revenues to date have been primarily due to sales of adi chipsets that use our adsl technology 
while we expect to see an increase in the number of our customers with adsl chipsets on the market  our revenue in the near term is highly dependent upon adi s ability to maintain their market share and pricing 
to the extent that adi is unable to maintain market share or experiences significant price erosion in its adsl chipsets  our revenue could decrease 
our success requires acceptance of our dsl technology by a variety of market participants due to our business strategy  our success is dependent on our ability to generate significant royalties from our licensing arrangements with semiconductor manufacturers 
our ability to generate significant royalties is materially affected by the acceptance of high speed access over telephone lines in general  and our dsl technology in particular by equipment companies  service providers  and end users 
equipment companies must incorporate our dsl technology equipment companies  particularly those that develop and market high volume business and consumer products such as central office line cards  modems and personal computers  must purchase chipsets containing our dsl technology from our licensees for us to be successful 
there are other solutions available for equipment companies seeking to offer high speed network access products 
therefore  we face the risk that equipment manufacturers will choose chipset solutions that do not incorporate our technology 
generally  our ability to influence their decision whether to adopt our technology is limited 
we also face the risk that equipment companies that elect to incorporate our dsl technology into their products will not compete successfully against other equipment companies 
many factors beyond our control could influence the success or failure of a particular equipment company that adopts our technology  including o competition from other businesses in the same industry  o market acceptance of its products  o its engineering  sales and marketing  and management capabilities  o technical challenges of developing its products unrelated to our technology  and o its financial and other resources 
therefore  even if equipment companies incorporate our dsl technology into their products  we cannot be sure that their products will achieve commercial acceptance or result in significant royalties to us 
service providers must initiate substantial deployments of dsl services based on our technology the success of our business strategy depends upon whether telecommunications service providers deploy dsl technologies and upon the timing of that deployment 
factors that will affect such deployment include o the development of a viable business model for dsl services  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain dsl services  o cost constraints  such as installation costs and space and power requirements at the telecommunications service provider s central office  o lack of interoperability of dsl equipment that is supplied by different manufacturers  o evolving industry standards for dsl technologies  and o government regulation 
if service providers do not deploy services based on dsl technology  our business will be seriously harmed 
even if service providers deploy dsl technologies  we cannot be sure that they will deploy services based on our dsl technology 
end users must purchase services that incorporate our technology even if numerous service providers adopt our dsl technology  our success ultimately will depend on acceptance of services incorporating our dsl technology by end users  such as access service subscribers and users of personal computers and modems 
dsl services compete with a variety of different high speed internet connectivity technologies  including cable modems  satellite  and other wireless technologies 
many of these technologies will compete effectively with dsl services 
if any technology competing with dsl technology is more reliable  faster  less expensive  reaches more customers  or has other advantages over dsl technology  then the demand for dsl services  and therefore our technology may decrease 
our intellectual property is subject to limited protection because we are a technology provider  our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others is critical to our success 
we regard our technology as proprietary  and we have a number of patents and pending patent applications 
we also rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark law and non disclosure agreements to protect our unpatented intellectual property 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization 
as part of our licensing arrangements  we typically work closely with our semiconductor and equipment manufacturer licensees  many of whom are also our potential competitors  and provide them with proprietary know how necessary for their development of customized chipsets based on our dsl technology 
although our license agreements contain non disclosure provisions and other terms protecting our proprietary know how and technology rights  it is possible that  despite these precautions  some of our licensees might obtain from us proprietary information that they could use to compete with us in the marketplace 
although we intend to defend our intellectual property as necessary  we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
in the future  we may choose to bring legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could be costly and time consuming for us  even if we were to prevail 
moreover  even if we are successful in protecting our proprietary information  we cannot be sure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the misappropriation of our technology or the development of competitive technology could seriously harm our business 
our technology may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a large and increasing number of participants in the telecommunications industry have applied for or obtained patents 
some of these patent holders have demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
from time to time  we have received claims from other companies that our technology infringes their patent rights 
while we believe our technology offerings do not infringe the intellectual property of others  we cannot be sure 
intellectual property rights can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing the proprietary rights of others  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we were found to have infringed any third party s patents  then we could be subject to substantial damages and an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
our business is subject to rapid technological change the telecommunications industry in general  and the market for high speed network access technologies in particular  are characterized by rapid technological change  with new generations of products being introduced regularly and with ongoing evolutionary improvements 
we expect to depend on our dsl technology for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we face risks that others could introduce competing technology that renders our dsl technology less desirable or obsolete 
also  the announcement of new technologies could cause our licensees or their customers to delay or defer entering into arrangements for the use of our existing technology 
either of these events could seriously harm our business 
we expect that our business will depend to a significant extent on our ability to introduce enhancements and new generations of our dsl technology as well as new technologies that keep pace with other changes in the telecommunications industry and that achieve rapid market acceptance 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to achieving technical innovations 
these innovations are complex and require long development cycles 
moreover  we may have to make substantial investments in technological innovations before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may lack sufficient financial resources to fund future development 
also  our licensees may decide not to share certain research and development costs with us 
revenue from technological innovations  even if successfully developed  may not be sufficient to recoup the costs of development 
one element of our business strategy is to assume the risks of technology development failure while reducing such risks for our licensees 
in the past  we have spent significant amounts on development projects that did not produce any marketable technologies or products  and we expect that to occur again in the future 
we face intense competition from a wide range of manufacturers and vendors the markets for telecommunications and semiconductor products are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to increase in the immediate future  because of the rapid growth projected across the dsl industry 
because of our strategy  we face three different kinds of competition and competitors  including technology licensing competition 
semiconductor and equipment manufacturers that develop and sell dsl products may either develop dsl technology internally or license it from third parties 
while we know of no other independent companies that license dsl technology  such as aware  we face intense competition from internal development teams within potential customers 
some of these potential customers are some of the largest semiconductor and equipment companies in the world 
furthermore  our current customers may choose to abandon joint development projects with us and develop dsl solutions without using our technology 
dsl chipset competition 
our customers chipsets compete with chipsets from other vendors of standards based and non standards based dsl chipsets 
some of these vendors include alcatel  broadcom  centillium  conexant  itex  globespan  pctel  ti  tioga  and virata 
network competition 
dsl services offered over copper telephone networks compete with alternative broadband transmission technologies that use other network architectures  such as cable modems and wireless solutions 
many of our current and prospective licensees  as well as chipset competitors that compete with our semiconductor licensees  including alcatel  broadcom  conexant  and ti  have significantly greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not seriously harm our business 
we require additional highly qualified engineering personnel our future success will depend significantly on our ability to attract  motivate and retain additional highly qualified engineering personnel 
competition for qualified engineers is intense and there are a limited number of available persons with the necessary knowledge and experience in dsl  chip design and related technologies 
finding  training and integrating additional qualified personnel is likely to be difficult and expensive  and we may be unable to do so successfully 
in the past  we were not able to hire all of the engineers that we wanted to hire 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  stock options have been an important element of our program to fairly compensate and retain highly qualified employees 
the recent decline of telecommunications technology stocks in general and our stock in particular has left the vast majority of our employees with stock options that are significantly out of the money 
if the price of our stock does not increase or if we do not otherwise address this situation through the grant of new stock options or additional compensation  we may have difficulty retaining employees  which could seriously harm our business 
our stock price may be volatile volatility in our stock price may negatively impact the price you may receive for your shares of common stock and increases the risk that we could be the subject of costly securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially based on a variety of factors  including o quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  o changes in future financial guidance that we may provide to investors and public market analysts  o changes in our relationships with our licensees  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our licensees or our competitors  o changes in dsl market growth rates as well as investor perceptions regarding the investment opportunity that companies participating in the dsl industry afford them  o changes in earnings estimates by public market analysts  o key personnel losses  o sales of common stock  and o developments or announcements with respect to industry standards  patents or proprietary rights 
in addition  the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
government regulation the extensive regulation of the telecommunications industry by federal  state and foreign regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission  or fcc  and various state public utility and service commissions  could affect us through the effects of such regulation on our licensees and their customers 
in addition  our business may also be affected by the imposition of certain tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that our customers obtain from non domestic suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products sold internationally and incorporating our technology 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could seriously harm affect our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which required adoption in periods beginning after june  fas was subsequently amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company will adopt fas during fiscal  as required 
the company has not historically entered into transactions involving derivative instruments  nor has it hedged any of its business activities  so it does not believe that adoption of fas will have an effect on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  and the effect that changes in interest rates would have on that portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes o cash and cash equivalents  which consist of financial instruments with purchased maturities of three months or less  and o short term investments  which consist of financial instruments that meet the high quality standards specified in our investment policy 
this policy dictates that all instruments mature in months or less  and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december  and  all of our investments matured in twelve months or less 
due to the short duration of the financial instruments we invest in  we do not expect that an increase in interest rates would result in any material loss to our investment portfolio
