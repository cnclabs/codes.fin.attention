item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct our operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulation 
for additional information concerning these factors  see business factors that may affect future results on page overview our net income for totaled a record million or per share on a diluted basis 
included in the results was a million after tax gain from the sale of our indirect automobile finance subsidiary in february excluding the gain  our net income for the year would have been million or per share on a diluted basis  up from million or per share in the increase in our adjusted net income between years was due to higher net income from our banking operations  as net income from our real estate investment activities declined million to million due primarily to lower net gains from sales of properties 
on an adjusted basis  net income from our banking operations increased million or to million due to the following o net interest income increased million or due to an increase in average interest earning assets as our effective interest rate spread declined  o provision for loan losses declined by million due primarily to lower growth in our loan portfolio than a year ago and the sale of our indirect automobile finance subsidiary  and o operating expense declined by million due to lower general and administrative costs primarily associated with residential lending activities and the sale of our indirect automobile finance subsidiary 
our efficiency ratio the percentage of our net interest income and other income excluding income from real estate investment activities and investment securities gains or losses used to cover our general and administrative costs improved from in to in those favorable items were partially offset by a million decline in other income  as an increase of million in loan and deposit related fees were unable to offset the following o a million decline in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities due to a lower volume of loans being sold  and o a million loss in loan servicing fees compared to income of million in our current year loss resulted from a million addition to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights due to an increase in expected prepayments from the drop in late in mortgage interest rates

excluding the gain on sale of subsidiary  our adjusted returns were on average assets and on average equity 
both these performance ratios compare favorably to when our return on average assets was and our return on average equity was 
our assets increased billion or during to billion at year end  following a record increase during assets expanded in primarily from loan growth 
our single family loan originations decreased from billion in to billion in  of which billion were originated for sale in the secondary market 
of the current year s total  million represented originations for portfolio of subprime credits as part of our continuing strategy to enhance the portfolio s net yield 
in addition to single family loans  we originated million of other loans during the year  including million of construction and land loans and million of automobile loans 
we funded our asset growth with deposits that increased to billion at december  non performing assets totaled million at december   up from million a year ago 
this increase was due primarily to a rise in residential non performers  of which million was in the subprime category 
when measured as a percentage of total assets  our non performing assets rose from at year end to at year end at december   the bank exceeded all three regulatory capital tests  with capital to asset ratios of in tangible and core capital and in risk based capital 
these capital levels are significantly above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal banking regulators of for core and tangible capital and for risk based capital

the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities principally affects net interest income 
our net interest income was million in  up million or from and million or greater than the improvement over primarily reflected an increase in average earning assets as our effective interest rate spread declined 
our average earning assets increased by billion or to billion 
our effective interest rate spread averaged in  down from in and in the decline in the effective interest rate spread primarily reflected a higher proportion of earning assets in the current year being funded with higher cost certificates of deposit and borrowings thereby resulting in the cost of funds increasing more rapidly than the yield on earning assets 
to a lesser extent  the sale of our indirect automobile lending subsidiary also contributed to the decline in the effective interest rate spread  as the loan yield on that portfolio was higher than the yield on our remaining loan portfolio 
the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of o interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and o interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals o the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by o average interest earning assets for the period 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits  borrowings and capital securities for the periods indicated 
we included non accrual loans in the average interest earning assets balance

excluding the gain  our net income from banking operations would have increased during by million or 
the increase in our adjusted net income reflected several factors 
net interest income increased million or due to an increase in our average earning assets as our effective interest rate spread declined 
also contributing to the increase between years were decreases of million in provision for loan losses and million in operating expense 
these decreases were primarily associated with the sale of our indirect automobile finance subsidiary as well as lower loan origination volumes and costs associated with residential lending activities 
these favorable items were partially offset by a decline of million in adjusted other income 
the decline in adjusted other income was primarily due to lower net gains losses on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities and loan servicing fees which more than offset higher loan and deposit related fees

real estate investment net income from our real estate investment operations totaled million in  down from million in and million in the decline was primarily attributed to lower net gains on sales and to an increase to valuation allowances in the current year compared to a reduction in valuation allowances in also contributing to the decline was a lower level of net rental income due to fewer properties being owned

our loan originations  including loans purchased  totaled billion in  down from billion in but up from billion in this current year decrease primarily reflects a decline in originations of one to four unit residential loans

in adjustable rate mortgage transactions for which we charge no origination fees  we receive a larger margin over the index to which the loan pricing is tied than in those in which we charge fees 
in addition  a prepayment fee on these loans is generally required if prepaid within the first three years 
this trend towards loans with no origination fees has generally resulted in deferrable loan origination costs exceeding loan origination fees 
residential one to four unit adjustable rate mortgage originations  including loans purchased  were billion during  down from billion in but up from billion in refinancing activities related to residential one to four unit loans  including new loans to refinance existing loans which we or other lenders originated  constituted of originations during the year compared to during and during refinancing activities decreased from billion in to billion in as a higher interest rate environment existed throughout most of the year 
in addition  the majority of residential originations were adjustable rate mortgages tied to the fhlb eleventh district cost of funds index cofi  an index which lags the movement in market interest rates 
for the year  of one to four unit originations for investment represented monthly adjusting cofi rate mortgages which provide for negative amortization  represented cofi rate mortgages which reprice every six months but do not provide for negative amortization  with the balance represented by a variety of other pricing terms

asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
this interest rate risk occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis generally more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  one of our principal objectives is to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income while maintaining asset quality 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value from specified changes in interest rates 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
our asset liability management committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  our asset liability management committee monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these reviews  our asset liability management committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and net portfolio value limits set forth in our interest rate risk policy 
one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as other information regarding the repricing and maturity difference between our interest earning assets and total deposits  borrowings and capital securities in future periods 
we refer to these differences as gap 
we have determined the repricing frequencies by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
we assume prepayment rates on substantially all of our loan portfolio based upon our historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on a number of our assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on our loans may adjust  and accordingly  these assets do not normally respond to changes in market interest rates as completely or rapidly as our liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if we used different assumptions or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

our six month gap at december  was a positive 
this means that more interest earning assets reprice within six months than total deposits  borrowings and capital securities 
this compares to a positive six month gap of at december  and at december  our primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of adjustable rate mortgages or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are primarily tied to cofi 
we originated and purchased approximately billion during  billion during and billion during of loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less 
these loans represented approximately during  during and during of all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during these periods 
at december   of our interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years  compared to at december  and at december  at december   loans held for investment and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates represented of those portfolios 
during  we will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to our customers to meet customer demand 
we primarily originate fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and price them accordingly to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet certain yield and other approved guidelines 
see business banking activities lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page we are better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  we remain subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  we establish limits on  and measure the sensitivity of  our net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
we utilize an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for net portfolio value  is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and net portfolio value due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and net portfolio value from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon our asset and liability structure as of year ends and since we base these estimates upon numerous assumptions  like the expected maturities of our interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  our actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations 
percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income value income value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments

non performing assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in our non performing assets during was primarily attributed to a rise in residential non performers of which million was in the subprime category 
of the total  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  net of allowances  represented million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  when measured as a percentage of total assets  our non performing assets rose to at year end  compared to at year end and at year end the following table summarizes our non performing assets at the dates indicated

allowance for loan losses does not include the allowance for real estate and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
it is our policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is our policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which are intended to result in our maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
we perform ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintain adequate loss allowances on the loans 
for a discussion on our internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page all but million of our non performing assets at december  were located in california 
we evaluate the need for appraisals for non performing assets on a periodic basis 
we will generally obtain a new appraisal when we believe that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing our loans 
our policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for major real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
throughout  we obtained new appraisals for non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans 
it is our general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in a number of cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when we determine that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   we had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
we reverse and charge against interest income any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans 
we recognize interest income on non accrual loans to the extent that we receive payments and to the extent that we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we restore these loans to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
additional loans aggregating million were not contractually past due  but were deemed non accrual due to management s assessment of the borrower s ability to pay 
troubled debt restructurings 
we consider a restructuring of a debt a troubled debt restructuring when we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate or reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of our investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible 
at december  we had less than million of troubled debt restructurings on accrual status representing a single one to four unit residential loan 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure and totaled million at december  delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  we normally record a notice of default to commence foreclosure proceedings  so long as we have given any required prior notice to the borrower 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  we may then sell the property at a foreclosure sale 
if we have elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  we are not permitted under applicable law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed 
at these foreclosure sales  we generally acquire title to the property 
at december   loans delinquent days or more as a percentage of total loans was  up from at year end and at year end the increase primarily occurred in our residential one to four unit categories 
as a percentage of its loan category  residential one to four units increased from at year end to at year end  while subprime residential one to four units increased from at year end to at year end a higher incidence of delinquency is expected on these subprime loans as these borrowers have a history of delinquencies for which we charge higher interest rates to compensate for that risk 
in addition  the loan to value ratio on these loans is generally lower thereby providing more equity protection against loss 
the increase in our residential one to four unit categories was partially offset by a decline in our delinquent automobile loans attributed to the sale of our indirect automobile finance subsidiary 
the following table indicates the amounts of our past due loans at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands days days days total days days days total loans secured by real estate residential one to four units         one to four units subprime         five or more units commercial real estate construction land total real estate loans         non mortgage commercial automobile   other consumer total delinquent loans         delinquencies as a percentage of total loans loans secured by real estate residential one to four units         one to four units subprime  five or more units commercial real estate construction land total real estate loans         non mortgage commercial automobile      other consumer total delinquent loans         delinquencies as a percentage of total loans loans secured by real estate residential one to four units     one to four units subprime five or more units commercial real estate construction land total real estate loans     non mortgage commercial automobile   other consumer total delinquent loans     delinquencies as a percentage of total loans all day or greater delinquencies are on non accrual status and we report them as part of non performing assets 
allowance for losses on loans and real estate we maintain a valuation allowance for losses on loans and real estate to provide for losses inherent in those portfolios 
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly by management to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses 
a key component to our evaluation is our internal asset review process 
our internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all our assets 
our internal asset review committee is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the internal asset review committee members include the chief internal asset review officer  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  general counsel  director of compliance risk management  credit administrator and chief appraiser 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review and to determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the internal asset review committee 
the chief internal asset review officer reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors regarding overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified assets and our adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation 
we adhere to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
our current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
we use the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance at a point in time 
we currently use a six grade system to classify our assets 
the current grades are o pass  o watch  o special mention  o substandard  o doubtful  and o loss 
we consider substandard  doubtful and loss assets classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows o the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
o the watch classification is used to identify an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but it is determined to be desirable to closely monitor the asset eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
o a special mention asset does not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
o substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if we do not correct the deficiencies 
o an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
we consider doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables us to more clearly define the potential for loss 
o that portion of an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of so little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of an impaired asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future 
we will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless we can expect payment from another source 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the total of specific valuation allowances established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require us to change our asset classifications 
if the change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the bank s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
our policy is to provide an allowance for losses on loans and real estate when it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
to comply with this policy  we have established a monitoring system that requires at least an annual review of all assets in excess of million and a semiannual review of all assets considered adversely classified or criticized 
the monitoring system requires a review of current operating statements  an evaluation of the property s current and past performance  an evaluation of the borrower s ability to repay and the preparation of a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on the results of the review  we may require a new appraisal 
we utilize the asset classifications from our internal asset review process in the following manner to determine the amount of our allowances o general valuation allowances this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie  assets classified pass or watch and takes into consideration loss that is imbedded within the portfolio but has not yet been realized 
generally  we believe that borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be borrower job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans  or loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loans 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying factors that take into consideration past loss experience and asset duration for each major asset type to the associated asset balance 
o allocated allowances this element relates to assets with well defined deficiencies or weaknesses ie  assets classified special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
we calculate on an ongoing basis loss by credit classification for each major asset type 
factors based upon those loss statistics are applied against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of allocated allowances 
included in these allowances are those amounts associated with assets where it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine the net fair value of the asset exceeds our carrying value  a specific allowance is recorded for the amount of that difference 
o unallocated allowance this element is more subjective and is reviewed quarterly to take into consideration estimation errors and economic trends that are not necessarily captured in determining the general valuation and allocated allowances 
our provision for loan losses was million in  down million from although the provision for loan losses exceeded our net loan charge offs by million  the allowance for loan losses declined by million to million at december  the decline in the allowance reflected a decrease of million in general valuation allowances to million due primarily to a reduction of million associated with the sale of the indirect automobile finance subsidiary which more than offset an increase related to increases in one to four unit residential loans 
allocated allowances declined by million of which million was associated with the subsidiary sale 
there was no change in the unallocated allowance of million 
during  our provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge offs by million resulting in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to million at december  the allowance increase reflected an increase of million in general valuation allowances to million due primarily to the increase during the year in the overall one to four unit residential loan portfolio  while allocated allowances increased million to million due primarily to an increase in loans classified substandard

impaired loans 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we carry impaired loans at either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable market price or the net fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment 
for us  loans we collectively review for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million 
in determining impairment  we consider large non homogeneous loans with the following characteristics non accrual loans  debt restructurings and performing loans which exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
we base the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral 
we value non collateral dependent loans based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate 
we generally use cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we include impairment losses in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
we include adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  we record loss of principal through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the recorded investment in loans for which we have recognized impairment totaled million  up from million at december  the total allowance for losses related to these loans was million for both december  and during  the total interest recognized on the impaired portfolio was million  compared to million in for further information regarding impaired loans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses associated with impaired loans is shown below for the years indicated

we believe our current sources of funds will enable us to meet these obligations while maintaining our liquidity at appropriate levels

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including a number of derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if specific conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as o a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  o a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or o a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
under sfas  an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  as part of our secondary marketing activities  we utilize forward sale and purchase derivative contracts to hedge the value of loans originated for sale against adverse changes in interest rates 
at december   sales contracts amounted to approximately million 
these contracts have a high correlation to the price movement of the loans being hedged 
there is no recognition of unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in the balance sheet or statement of income 
when the related loans are sold  the deferred gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in the statement of income as a component of net gains or losses on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities 
on january   we adopted sfas  and at that time  designated those sales contracts as cash flow derivative instruments in accordance with the requirements of the new standard 
these cash flow derivative instruments hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows attributable to interest rate risk 
cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding offset recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  net of tax 
amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period the hedged cash flow occurs 
derivative gains and losses not considered effective in hedging the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in the income statement 
with the implementation of sfas  we recorded after tax transition amounts associated with establishing the fair values of the derivative instruments and hedged items on the balance sheet as an increase of  to net income and a reduction of  in other comprehensive income 
in thousands summary of transition adjustment at january balance sheet assets other assets deferred income tax benefit liabilities and stockholders equity accounts payable and accrued liabilities accumulated other comprehensive loss unrealized losses on derivative instruments retained earnings statement of income cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income taxes net income the transition adjustment will be presented as a cumulative effect adjustment as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  in our financial statements 
the transition amounts were determined based on the interpretive guidance issued to date by the financial accounting standards board 
the financial accounting standards board continues to issue interpretive guidance which could require changes in our application of the standard and adjustment to the transition amounts 
we will continue to hedge as we have previously done  however  sfas  as applied to our risk management strategies  may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity prospectively  depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items  but will have no effect on cash flows or the overall economics of the transactions
