quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign exchange the company has foreign based operations  primarily in western europe  which accounted for of net sales 
the strengthening of the us dollar from to had a negative impact on sales and gross profit 
inventory purchases were made in us dollars or in currencies pegged to the us dollar 
this appreciation of the us dollar against the western european currencies had an adverse impact of about million on gross profit 
the company issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries denominated in us dollars on a long term basis  exposing the foreign subsidiaries to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates of their local currency relative to the us dollar 
the company does not regularly use forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures 
based on the company s foreign currency exchange rate exposure for intercompany borrowings of approximately million at december   a adverse change in currency rates would reduce accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million 
interest rates the company s credit arrangements expose it to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its revolving line of credit  which provided for interest to be paid quarterly based on a variable rate 
thus  interest rate changes would result in a change in the amount of interest to be paid each quarter 
based upon the interest rates and borrowings at december   a increase in interest rates would adversely affect the company s financial position  annual results of operations  or cash flows by approximately
