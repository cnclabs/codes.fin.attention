overview we were incorporated in august  as a delaware corporation and are located in alviso  california 
on august   tivo uk ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of tivo inc  was incorporated in the united kingdom 
the tivo service is a subscription based television service that provides viewers with greater control  easier navigation and a wider range of viewing options when watching television 
the tivo service also provides television content providers and advertisers with a new platform for content delivery  interactive viewing options and in home commerce 
the tivo service is enabled through a personal video recorder designed and developed by tivo 
we have generated a limited amount of revenues to date and expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
in particular  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to be a large portion of total expenses as personal video recorders gain market acceptance in the retail channel with the consumer and as we establish the tivo brand and educate and attract subscribers 
we launched the personal video recorder and service into the retail channel in the second half of we incurred losses of million in and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we currently generate revenues from two sources  subscription revenue and non subscription revenue 
subscriptions to the tivo service are available on a monthly  annual or lifetime basis 
the current price for a monthly subscription to the tivo service is per month  an annual subscription is per year and a lifetime subscription is 
a lifetime subscription allows access to the tivo service for the life of the personal video recorder 
subscription fees are paid by the viewer when activating the tivo service 
subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions are recognized ratably over a four year period 
non subscription revenue primarily includes charter advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer companies and media networks who have provided content on the tivo service 
we began selling personal video recorders and subscriptions to the tivo service on march  we transitioned manufacturing to philips  one of our manufacturing partners  in the fourth quarter of the sales of personal video recorders in were not expected to be recurring for tivo  and were therefore considered incidental to our business 
the sales less the cost of sales for the personal video recorders sold directly by tivo for the year ended december  were recorded as other operating expense  net 
since the tivo service is enabled through a personal video recorder that is sold in retail channels like other consumer electronic devices  we anticipate that our business will be seasonal and we expect to generate a significant number of our annual new subscriptions during the holiday shopping season 
we anticipate that the sources of our revenues will change over time 
in the future  we may generate revenue from other sources such as 
audience measurement reporting revenue  and 
electronic commerce or couch commerce 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our strategic partners in order to promote the tivo service and encourage the manufacture and distribution of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
these agreements may require us to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscriber with multiple partners 
if we reduce our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that our partnerships will help us obtain subscribers  broaden market acceptance of personal television and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we have agreed to make formula based payments to sony  thomson  quantum  philips and directv in exchange for key activities and results 
quantum provided us a discount payment for hard disk drives purchased by our manufacturing partners for use in the personal video recorder from quantum 
we have agreed to share a portion of the tivo service subscription revenues we receive from subscribers who have purchased personal video recorders and other devices equipped with quantum hard disk drives on which we received a discount from quantum 
we have agreed to pay to philips and sony a per unit subsidy for each personal video recorder that they manufacture and sell 
the amount of the payments can vary depending on philips and sony s manufacturing costs and selling prices 
we may make additional subsidy payments in the future to consumer electronic and other manufacturers in an effort to maintain a commercially viable retail price for the personal video recorders and other devices that enable the tivo service 
subsidy payments are renegotiated on an annual basis 
we pay directv a revenue share for our subscription revenues generated from directv subscribers in exchange for directv s marketing efforts 
payments made to our strategic partners in exchange for these services are recognized as sales and marketing related parties expenses 
in the past  we have issued stock in exchange for services to our strategic partners 
for example  we issued shares of our common stock to directv in exchange for marketing support and a note which is reduced as bandwidth capacity is made available to tivo on directv s satellite television system 
we also issued warrants  which were exercised for shares of our common stock to quantum in exchange for a discount on hard disk drives used in the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
we recorded prepaid marketing expenses resulting from the issuance of this equity to directv and quantum 
these prepaid marketing expenses are amortized as services are provided to us and charged to sales and marketing related parties expenses 
on september   tivo closed an investment agreement with aol for million 
the aol investment is part of a three year strategic production integration and marketing agreement between aol and tivo  in which tivo will become an aol tv programming partner offering aol tv subscribers access to features of the tivo service 
in return for aol s investment  tivo issued to aol a combination of convertible redeemable preferred stock  a portion of common stock subject to redemption  common stock and initial and performance warrants 
additionally  tivo has signed media insertion orders for and with aol for advertising programs to promote the tivo service on aol time warner properties see item  note 
prior to our initial public offering  we granted stock options to employees  consultants and directors at prices that were less than the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded deferred compensation related to these options  which is amortized over the vesting period of each option as stock based compensation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased customer subscriptions to the tivo service  which grew by approximately  new subscribers during  bringing the total installed subscriber base to approximately  as of december  cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of telecommunication and network expenses  employee salaries  call center and other expenses related to providing the tivo service to subscribers 
cost of services for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased telecommunications and network expenses due to the increase in number of activations

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses  media advertising  public relations activities  special promotions  trade shows and the production of product related items  including collateral and videos 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures for advertising  public relations and trade shows in connection with the continued retail marketing campaign of the tivo service and the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
advertising expenses  including public relations and trade shows  comprised over of the total increase in sales and marketing expenses from to for the year ended december   sales support expense was million compared to million for the year ended december  sales support accounted for of the total increase

the non cash portion is related to the amortization of warrants or common stock issued for services that we issued to aol  quantum  directv and creative artists agency  llc 
the total amount of warrant valuation and common stock issued for services as of december  was million 
of this amount  million has not yet been amortized 
we amortize the valuation of the warrants and common stock issued for services on a straight line basis over the period that the services are provided 
the cash portion of sales and marketing related parties expense is comprised of revenue share and manufacturing subsidy payments to philips  sony  quantum and directv 
additionally included are media insertion orders paid to aol 
subsidies are formula based payments to our partners in exchange for key activites and results 
the formulas are periodically adjusted based on our partners manufacturing costs and selling prices 
a portion of the subsidy is payable after shipment and the balance is payable after the subscription is activated 
since subsidies are based on the number or units manufactured and activated  we expect that as the volume of units manufactured increases our subsidy costs will increase proportionally 
we have also agreed to share a portion of our revenues with some of our strategic partners in order to promote the tivo service and encourage the manufacture and distribution of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
revenue share is calculated as an agreed upon percentage of revenue for a specified group of tivo subscribers 
we anticipate that our business will continue to grow and  as such  we expect the revenue share and manufacturing subsidy amounts to continue to be large for next year 
we are currently working with our partners to try to manage costs for calendar year general and administrative expenses

at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents

we believe that our capital is adequate to fund operations  capital expenditures and working capital needs through fiscal year ended january  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we continued to provide the tivo service  incurring a net loss of million

beyond one year  we may need to raise additional funds in order to 
fund anticipated growth  including significant increases in personnel  office facilities and computer systems  
develop new or enhance existing services or products  
expand into new markets and respond to competitive pressures  or 
acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
in addition  in order to meet long term liquidity needs  we may need to raise additional funds  establish a credit facility or seek other financing arrangements 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
see factors that may affect future operating results if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab clarifies the sec staff s views on application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
we have concluded that our revenue recognition policy continues to be appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information included in this annual report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects we have recognized very limited revenue  have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have recognized limited revenues  have incurred significant losses and have had substantial negative cash flow 
during the year ended december   we recognized subscription revenues of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
the size of these net losses depends in part on the growth in our subscriber base and on our expenses 
with increased expenses  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
consequently  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our limited operating history may make it difficult for us or investors to evaluate trends and other factors that affect our business 
we were incorporated in august and have been obtaining subscribers only since march  prior to that time  our operations consisted primarily of research and development efforts 
as of december   only a limited number of personal video recorders had been sold and we obtained only a limited number of subscribers to the tivo service 
as a result of our limited operating history  our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in evaluating our future operating results 
in addition  any evaluation of our business must be made in light of the risks and difficulties encountered by companies offering products or services in new and rapidly evolving markets 
for example  it may be difficult to accurately predict our future revenues  costs of revenues  expenses or results of operations 
personal television is a new product category for consumers and it may be difficult to predict the future growth rate  if any  or size of the market for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts and adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
this inability could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
if our marketing in the retail channel is not successful  consumers and consumer electronics manufacturers may not accept the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon a continually successful retail marketing campaign for the tivo service and related personal video recorders  which began in the third quarter of we will rely principally on our consumer electronics partners  such as philips and sony to manufacture  market  sell and support the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
we also will rely on the efforts of directv and bskyb to market  sell and support the tivo service to directv and bskyb subscribers 
the ongoing marketing campaign requires  among other things  that we 
educate consumers on the benefits of the tivo service and related personal video recorder  which will require an extensive marketing campaign  
commit a substantial amount of human and financial resources to achieve continued  successful retail distribution  and 
coordinate our own sales  marketing and support activities with those of philips  sony  bskyb  directv  aol and other strategic partners 
we or our strategic partners may not achieve any or all of these objectives 
in addition  consumers may perceive the tivo service and related personal video recorder as too expensive or complex and our marketing campaign may not effectively attract new subscribers 
because of competitive offerings or changing preferences  consumers may delay or decline the purchase of the tivo service and related personal video recorder 
all of these events would reduce consumer demand and market acceptance  diminish our brand and impair our ability to attract subscribers to the tivo service 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our strategic partners 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our strategic partners in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and marketing support and discounts on key components for personal video recorders 
given how these amounts are calculated  we may be required to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscriber with multiple partners 
these agreements require us to share a portion of our subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we change our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues is based on our expectation that our partnerships will help us obtain subscribers  broaden market acceptance of personal television and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute and supply critical components and services for the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a personal video recorder made available by a limited number of third parties 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the personal video recorders 
we do not control the time and resources that these third parties devote to our business 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and quickly achieve market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing partnerships are not successful  we may be unable to establish a market for our products and services 
we initially manufactured the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
we have entered into agreements with philips  sony  hughes and thomson uk to manufacture and distribute the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
however  we have no minimum volume commitments from philips  sony  hughes  thomson uk or any other manufacturer 
the ability of our manufacturing partners to reach sufficient production volume of the personal video recorder to satisfy anticipated demand is subject to delays and unforeseen problems such as defects  shortages of critical components and cost overruns 
moreover  they will require substantial lead times to manufacture anticipated quantities of the personal video recorders that enable the tivo service 
delays and other problems could impair the retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscribers 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturing partner would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do and which could prove time consuming and expensive 
although we expect to continue to contract with additional consumer electronics companies for the manufacture of personal video recorders in the future  we may be unable to establish additional relationships on acceptable terms 
if our corporate partners fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products and services 
our manufacturing partners distribute the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets and brand images to promote and support the personal video recorder and the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our manufacturing partners and other strategic partners to promote and support the personal video recorder and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these partners could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support personal video recorders and other devices that enable the tivo service 
we also expect to rely on aol  directv and other partners to provide marketing support for the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these partners to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for the personal video recorder and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscribers to the tivo service will be limited 
we are dependent on single suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components and services used in the personal video recorders and the tivo service 
for example 
quantum is the sole supplier of the hard disk drives  
nec is the sole supplier of the application specific integrated circuit  a semiconductor device  
sony is the sole supplier of the mpeg encoder semiconductor device  and 
tribune media services is the sole supplier of program guide data 
in addition to the above  we have several sole suppliers for key components of our products currently under development 
we cannot be sure that alternative sources for key components and services used in the personal video recorders and the tivo service will be available when needed or  if available  that these components and services will be available on favorable terms 
if our agreements or our manufacturing partners agreements with quantum  nec  sony or tribune media services were to terminate or expire  or if we or our manufacturing partners were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or required program guide data  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product availability 
our ability to generate revenues from subscription fees is unproven and may fail 
we expect to generate a substantial portion of our revenues from subscription fees for the tivo service 
many of our potential customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television services 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees will harm our ability to effectively attract subscribers 
in addition  the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service can be used to record programs and pause  rewind and fast forward through live or recorded shows without an active subscription to the tivo service 
if a significant number of purchasers of the personal video recorders use these devices without subscribing to the tivo service  our revenue growth will decline and we may not achieve profitability 
our business is expanding rapidly and our failure to manage growth could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
since we began our business in august  we have significantly expanded our operations 
we anticipate continued expansion in our headcount and infrastructure to support potential growth in our subscriber base and to allow us to pursue market opportunities 
this expansion has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include we need to attract and retain qualified personnel  and any failure to do so may impair our ability to offer new products or grow our business 
our success will depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate managerial  technical  marketing  financial  administrative and customer support personnel 
competition for such employees is intense  especially for engineers in the san francisco bay area  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire  train  retain and manage required personnel  we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or otherwise implement our business strategy 
any inability of our systems to accommodate our expected subscriber growth may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we rapidly add new subscribers is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscriber growth and add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
we will need to provide acceptable customer support  and any inability to do so will harm our brand and ability to generate and retain new subscribers 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscribers and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
some customers require significant support when installing the personal video recorder and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products and services to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service and personal video recorder will damage our reputation in the personal television and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and strategic partners 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscribers and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our expected growth  and any inability to do so will adversely impact our billing and reporting 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations and expected growth 
for example  we replaced our accounting and billing system at the beginning of august delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could adversely impact our relationships with subscribers and cause harm to our reputation and brand 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our operational and financial systems and controls could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
if we are unable to create multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses or meet our obligations to strategic partners and other third parties 
although our initial success will depend on building a significant customer base and generating subscription fees from the tivo service  our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue streams such as 
advertising  
revenues from networks  and 
electronic commerce or couch commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscribers to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to effectively work with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscribers and strategic partners will seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 
it will take a substantial amount of time and resources to achieve broad market acceptance of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service and we cannot be sure that these efforts will generate a broad enough subscriber base to sustain our business 
personal television products and services represent a new  untested consumer electronics category 
the tivo service is in an early stage of development and many consumers are not aware of its benefits 
as a result  it is uncertain whether the market will demand and accept the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
retailers  consumers and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from personal television products and services 
likewise  consumers may not value  and may be unwilling to pay for the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
to develop this market and obtain subscribers to the tivo service  we will need to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products 
we may fail to obtain subscribers  encourage the development of new devices that enable the tivo service and develop and offer new content and services 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues and ability to generate subscribers 
the personal television market is new and rapidly evolving and we expect competition from a number of sources  including internet related companies and companies offering similar products and services 
we are likely to face intense direct competition from companies such as webtv networks inc  sonicblue and x tv 
these companies offer  or have announced their intention to offer  products with one or more of the tivo service s functions or features and  in some instances  combine these features with internet browsing or traditional broadcast  cable or satellite television programming 
many of these companies have greater brand recognition and market presence and substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
for example  microsoft corporation controls and provides financial backing to webtv 
some of these companies also have established relationships with third party consumer electronic manufacturers  network operators and programmers  which could make it difficult for us to establish relationships and enter into agreements with these third parties 
some of these competitors also have relationships with our strategic partners 
for example  directv recently formed an alliance with microsoft 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to expand our market share and attract an increasing number of subscribers to the tivo service 
established competitors in the consumer electronics market 
we compete with consumer electronic products in the television and home entertainment industry 
the television and home entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation  a small number of dominant manufacturers and intense price competition 
as a new product category  personal television enters a market that is crowded with several established products and services 
the competition for consumer spending in the television and home entertainment market is intense  and our products and services will compete with 
satellite television systems  
video on demand services  
digital video disc players  and 
laser disc players 
most of these technologies or devices have established markets  a broad subscriber base and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate the personal video recorder or the tivo service from these devices 
established competition for advertising budgets 
personal television  in general  and tivo  specifically  also compete with traditional advertising media such as print  radio and television for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive personal television as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to promotions on the tivo service 
if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscriber base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscribers and generate revenues  we must continue to add functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for personal television 
if we are unable to further develop and improve the tivo service or expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain subscribers and generate revenue will suffer 
if we do not successfully establish strong brand identity in the personal television market  we may be unable to achieve widespread acceptance of our products 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic partnerships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the personal television market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscribers or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscribers and effectively compete in the personal television market 
product defects  system failures or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new subscribers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects 
these problems can affect system uptime  result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the personal video recorders and the tivo service 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
from time to time  we may be subject to intellectual property litigation  which could 
be time consuming and expensive  
divert management s attention and resources away from our business  
cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  
cause the cancellation of new products or services  or 
require us to pay significant royalties or licensing fees 
the emerging enhanced television industry is highly litigious  particularly in the area of on screen program guides 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
for example  we are aware of at least seven patents for pausing live television 
a number of companies in the enhanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies such as ours is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturing partners to cease manufacturing the personal video recorder or us to cease providing our service  or both  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
on january   phonetel communications  inc filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of texas alleging willful and deliberate violation of us patent number  entitled computer control for vcr including display of record playback listing and playback order selection  held by phonetel 
the complaint alleged that tivo infringed the patent by  among other things  making  using  selling  offering to sell and or importing its television set top boxes  and sought unspecified monetary damages  an injunction against tivo s operations  and attorneys fees and costs 
on april   the suit was voluntarily dismissed by phonetel 
while the suit could be re filed by phonetel  tivo believes that it has meritorious defenses against the claims and would vigorously defend itself against such claims 
in the event the suit is re filed  tivo could be forced to incur material expenses  and in the event it were to lose such a suit  its business would be harmed 
on january   starsight telecast inc  a subsidiary of gemstar international group limited filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging willful and deliberate violation of us patent number  entitled tv schedule system and process  held by starsight 
the complaint alleged that tivo infringed the patent by  among other things  making  using  selling  offering to sell and or importing its tv schedule systems and processes without a license from starsight 
starsight seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against our operations 
the suit also seeks attorneys fees and costs 
tivo believes that we have has meritorious defenses against the suit and intends to vigorously defend ourself 
on february   tivo counterclaimed against starsight  gemstar development corporation and gemstar international group limited seeking damages for federal antitrust violations and state unfair business practices claims  as well as declaratory relief of non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability with respect to the patent 
tivo could be forced to incur material expenses during this litigation  and in the event we were to lose this suit our business would be harmed 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the personal television industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the personal television industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
a number of articles have appeared in the press regarding the formation of a consortium of broadcast and cable television networks called the advanced television copyright coalition 
some of those articles have indicated that the coalition is prepared to support litigation and to explore legislative solutions unless the members of the personal television industry agree to obtain license agreements for use of the companies programming 
we have received letters from time warner inc and fox television stating that these entities believe our personal television service exploits copyrighted networks and programs without the necessary licenses and business arrangements 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our use of some television content  increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our proprietary rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering substantially all of the technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  none of these patents has been granted  and we cannot assure you that any patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
laws or regulations that govern the television industry and the delivery of programming could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply or could require us to change our business 
personal television and the delivery of television programming through the tivo service and a personal video recorder represents a new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate or the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could require changes to our business 
for example  copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the personal television market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the majority of fcc regulations  while not directly affecting us  do affect many of the strategic partners on whom we substantially rely for the marketing and distribution of the personal video recorder and the tivo service 
as such  the indirect effect of these regulations may adversely affect our business 
in addition  the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter the features or functionality of the tivo service 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscribers confidential data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the personal video recorder collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our subscribers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscribers confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscribers could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and personal video recorder 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our subscribers viewing choices while using the tivo service 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual subscriber 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for personal television and our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 
demand for personal video recorders and the tivo service  
the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  
seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  
changes in revenue sharing arrangements with our strategic partners  
entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  
changes in the subsidy payments we make to certain strategic partners  
changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  
loss of subscribers to the tivo service  and 
general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenue could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we believe that sales of personal video recorders and new subscriptions to the tivo service will be disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 
if we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
we have agreed to subsidize the cost of manufacturing personal video recorders  which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to achieve profitability 
we have agreements with our consumer electronic manufacturing partners to manufacture the personal video recorder that enables the tivo service 
we have agreed to pay our manufacturing partners a per unit subsidy for each personal video recorder that they manufacture and sell 
the amount of the payments can vary depending upon the manufacturing costs and selling prices 
in addition  in the event our manufacturing partners are unable to manufacture the personal video recorders at the costs currently estimated or if selling prices are less than anticipated  we may owe additional amounts to them  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are obligated to pay a portion of the subsidy when the personal video recorder is shipped  and we will not receive any revenues related to the unit until the unit is sold and the purchaser activates the tivo service 
we may make additional subsidy payments in the future to consumer electronic and other manufacturers in an effort to maintain a commercially viable retail price for the personal video recorders and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently offer commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs 
we currently offer product lifetime subscriptions that commit us to provide service for as long as the personal video recorder is in service 
we receive the lifetime subscription fee for the tivo service in advance and amortize it as subscription revenue over four years  which is our estimate of the service life of the personal video recorder 
if these lifetime subscribers use the personal video recorder for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs without a corresponding revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources 
if we lose key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of any members of our executive management team and our inability to hire additional executive management could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we do not have employment agreements with  or key man insurance policies for  any of our key personnel 
we expect to experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
since our initial public offering in september through march   our common stock has closed between per share and per share  closing at on march  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to  among other things  the factors discussed in this section and the following factors 
changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  
our failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  
release of new or enhanced products or introduction of new marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  
announcements by us or our competitors of the creation  developments under or termination of significant strategic partnerships  joint ventures  significant contracts or acquisitions  
fluctuations in the market prices generally for technology related stocks  
fluctuations in general economic conditions  
fluctuations in interest rates  
market conditions affecting the television and home entertainment industry  
fluctuations in operating results  and 
additions or departures of key personnel 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement and delaware law could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock 
we may become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law  our organizational documents and our rights agreement could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board or the chief executive officer 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a rights agreement 
each share of our common stock has attached to it a right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of our series b junior participating preferred stock at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share in the event that the rights become exercisable 
the rights become exercisable upon the earlier to occur of i ten days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock  subject to limited exceptions  or ii ten business days or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an acquiring person as described in the preceding clause following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of or more of our common stock  subject to limited exceptions 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our rights agreement could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the nature of some of our strategic relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we may engage in discussions with other parties concerning strategic relationships  which may include equity investments by such parties in our company 
we currently have such relationships with a number of our strategic partners  including aol  directv  sony and philips 
while we believe that such relationships have enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model  the terms and conditions of such relationships may place some restrictions on our freedom to operate in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and conduct all transactions in us dollars 
our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with original maturities of less than one year 
we are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our results of operations or cash flows for our cash and cash equivalents and our short term investments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our cash and cash equivalents 
we had no short term investments at this time 
cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate although payments under the operating lease for our facility are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with the operating lease 
our capital lease obligations are not subject to changes in the interest rate and  therefore  are not exposed to interest rate risk
