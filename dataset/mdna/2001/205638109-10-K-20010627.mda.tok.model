s product revenue mainframe revenue decreased million or during fiscal and increased million or during fiscal revenue from distributed software products decreased million or during fiscal and increased million or during fiscal the overall decline in product revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year is primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for large enterprise license agreements and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
if foreign exchange rates remained consistent with fiscal  product revenue would have been million in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal this represents an overall decline in constant us dollars of million or compared to the actual decline of million or 
product revenue in fiscal year was negatively impacted by a decrease in customer demand for large enterprise license agreements elas which are multi year  and often multi payment contracts 
we believe that the decrease in large multi year contracts is due  in part  to the capacity purchased by our customers in fiscal year during their preparations for yk 
the increase in product revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased demand for elas to meet customer needs at that time 
for fiscal years and  multi year contracts greater than million represented approximately and  respectively  of license revenue 
the products organization is focused on completing a larger number of transactions each quarter rather than relying on elas 
for more than five years  the company has supported clients with product agreements covering multiple years and allowing deferred payment terms 
the contract price is allocated between maintenance for the term of the deal and license revenue 
all license revenue associated with these perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed and the software has been shipped to the customer 
license revenue associated with certain transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future has been deferred and will be recognized over the term of the deal 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term

products expenses include cost of software license fees  cost of maintenance  software product development costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
the decrease in operating margin in fiscal is primarily a result of a decrease in software license revenue while total products costs have remained fairly constant 
the increase in operating margin in fiscal is primarily the result of economies associated with larger transactions  more sales representatives in the field with increased sales productivity  additional product offerings and increased market penetration of our distributed software products 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of preparing and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
the increase in these costs is due primarily to an increase in amortization of capitalized software products  related to the programart  caci and optimal acquisitions and  in fiscal  to increased amortization of internally capitalized projects associated with ecosystems  qaload  uniface  abendaid  fileaid and xpediter  which were released for general availability during fiscal year in fiscal  increases in author royalties were offset  in part  by decreased packaging and distribution costs 
as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance consists of the cost of maintenance programmers and product support personnel and the computing  facilities and benefits costs allocated to such personnel 
the increase in cost of maintenance was due to a higher average headcount during fiscal and fiscal compared to the prior fiscal years

software product development costs consist of the cost of programming personnel  the facilities  computing and benefits costs allocated to such personnel and the costs of preparing user and installation guides for the company s software products  less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the fiscal year

the decrease in sales and marketing costs from fiscal to fiscal was largely attributable to lower sales commissions associated with decreased product sales and to reduced advertising expenditures  offset  in part  by increased salary and benefits costs due  primarily  to a higher average headcount during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal was largely attributable to the expansion of the worldwide sales force  higher sales commissions associated with increased product sales  and increased allocations of costs of corporate systems  offset  in part  by decreased advertising expenditures

this compares to a tax provision of million in fiscal  which represents an effective tax rate of  and an income tax provision of million in fiscal  which represents an effective tax rate of 
the fiscal and fiscal increases in the effective tax rate were due to nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with certain acquisitions and a shift of our state apportionment to states with higher corporate income tax rates

the company has adopted sfas effective april  the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
forward looking statements the company makes forward looking statements in this report within the meaning of the federal securities laws and may make forward looking statements on future filings with the securities and exchange commission and in press releases and other communications 
forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect the company s operating results  including without limitation those discussed below 
these factors  risks and uncertainties could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected by certain relatively fixed costs 
our product revenues vary from quarter to quarter 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenues because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products which keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences 
approximately of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks such as the need to comply with foreign and us export laws  and the uncertainty of certain foreign economies 
while we are expanding our focus on distributed software products  a majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of ibm and ibm compatible mainframe products and on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses  upgrades and maintenance 
the pricing of our software licenses and maintenance is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we have not received any material claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current and future products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
we depend on key employees and technical personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating margins may continue to decline 
we do not compile margin analysis other than on a segment basis 
however  we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since we believe the best opportunities for revenue growth are in the distributed systems market  products operating margins could experience more pressure 
in addition  operating margins in the professional services business are significantly impacted by small fluctuations in revenue since most costs are fixed during any short term period 
a general or regional slowdown in the world economy could cause customers to delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the company s cash investments  revolving credit facility and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of the company s investment strategy 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and preserves its invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  the company has classified all its marketable debt securities and long term debt investments as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of income or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about the company s investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except interest rates fair value at fy fy total march  cash equivalents    average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent investments     average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent at march  the company s outstanding variable rate debt was million 
each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have million effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balance of such debt at march  information about the company s long term debt is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company offers financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with its multi year software sales see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations product revenue 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a three to five year period 
as of march   non current receivables amount to million and are due approximately million  million  million  million and million in each of the years ended march  through and thereafter  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the company s designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since the company enters into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
the company operates in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the table below provides information about the company s foreign exchange forward contracts at march  the table presents the value of the contracts in us dollars at the contract maturity date and the fair value of the contracts at march  in thousands  except contract rates contract maturity forward fair date in date in contract position in value at rate us dollars march  australian dollar march april   canadian dollar march april   danish krone march april hong kong dollar march april   japanese yen march april singapore dollar march april   swiss franc march april   british pound march april   euro dollar march april   approximately of our revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows
