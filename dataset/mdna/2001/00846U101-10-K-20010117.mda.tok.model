item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements regarding the anticipated completion of transactions and our liquidity position that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed below in factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview on march   hewlett packard company hewlett packard announced a plan to create a separate company  subsequently named agilent technologies  that comprised hewlett packard s test and measurement  semiconductor products  healthcare solutions and chemical analysis businesses  related portions of hewlett packard laboratories  and associated infrastructure 
on november   we began operating as a separate  stand alone company 
on november   we launched our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
after the completion of our initial public offering in november  hewlett packard owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on november   we paid the net proceeds of the offering of billion to hewlett packard as a dividend 
on april   hewlett packard announced that its board of directors had declared a stock dividend of all of hewlett packard s shares in us 
the dividend was distributed on june  to hewlett packard shareholders of record as of may  the distribution was made on the basis of of an agilent share for each hewlett packard common share outstanding 
we were incorporated in delaware in may as a wholly owned subsidiary of hewlett packard 
our businesses historically were operated as internal units of hewlett packard 
in november  hewlett packard transferred to us a majority of the assets and liabilities relating to our businesses and also provided us with cash funding of approximately billion 
hewlett packard retained some of our assets and liabilities including our accounts receivable and accounts payable  accrued payroll and related items and taxes payable  except deferred taxes  and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business  including some of the accounts receivable  accounts payable and other liabilities of agilent technologies japan  ltd 
formerly hewlett packard japan  ltd in addition  hewlett packard transferred to us million to fund our acquisition of yokogawa electric corporation s minority equity ownership of agilent technologies japan  ltd 
in december  hewlett packard provided us with additional cash funding of approximately million based on our and hewlett packard s balance sheets as of october  we have entered into various agreements with hewlett packard related to certain ongoing relationships between the companies 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with hewlett packard under which hewlett packard will provide services to us during a transition period which began november  for a brief description of these agreements  see note  transactions with hewlett packard  of the consolidated financial statements 
the agreements relate primarily to information technology  customer financing  accounting and administrative  and building services 
under these agreements  we reimburse hewlett packard for its cost of the service plus 
the transition period varies depending on the agreement but is generally less than two years 
some of the agreements  including those for building services and information technology services  may be extended beyond the initial transition period 
if these agreements are extended  we will reimburse hewlett packard at its cost plus for information technology services and most other services and at negotiated market rates for building services 
the agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves 
however  we believe that purchasing these services from hewlett packard provides us with an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
in addition  we provide some transition services to hewlett packard  for which we are reimbursed at our cost plus 
basis of presentation our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations  changes in cash flows  and the financial position of our businesses 
we began accumulating retained earnings on november  the and consolidated financial statements were prepared using hewlett packard s historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our historical results of operations 
the and consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain hewlett packard corporate expenses  including centralized research and development  legal  accounting  employee benefits  real estate  insurance services  information technology services  treasury and other hewlett packard corporate and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations were determined on bases that hewlett packard and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to us or the benefit received by us 
therefore  the financial information presented in this financial report for and is not indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in subsequent periods nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity in those periods prior to restructuring  asset impairment and other charges in august  we announced a restructuring of our healthcare solutions business 
the restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction through severance programs  as well as consolidation of our business operations 
since the announcement  regular employees located in the united states  asia pacific and europe have accepted severance packages and temporary employees have been terminated 
we recognized a million pre tax restructuring charge comprised of million for estimated severance benefits and million for non cash asset writedowns 
of this amount  million was included in cost of products  million in cost of services and other 
the remainder was included in other operating expense line items 
as of october   million in severance benefits has been paid and charged against the liability 
the reminder of the liability is expected to be utilized during in  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to a building that was under construction for the intended purpose of housing manufacturing operations for eight inch cmos semiconductor wafers 
at the time construction was stopped  only the building shell was complete 
after exhaustive efforts to find a semiconductor manufacturing partner to utilize the building for its initial intended use  management concluded that the highest fair value to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office or general use facility 
in  we actively marketed the building shell without success 
in late  in response to the increased demand in the wireless semiconductor market and our need to increase gallium arsenide gaas manufacturing capacity  management decided to resume construction of a portion of the building shell 
when completed  this portion of the building will manufacture six inch gaas semiconductor wafers 
we anticipate that the completed manufacturing facility will be put into service sometime in  at which time depreciation will commence 
during  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million related to the transfer of the production of certain semiconductor wafers to a third party contractor 
of this amount  million was included in cost of products  million in research and development and million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
included in this charge was million for non cash asset writedowns of equipment that was subsequently abandoned or sold 
also included in this charge was million for employee severance benefits that have been paid 
also during  we recorded a pre tax charge of million for the writedown of an investment in convertible preferred stock of a medical products company to its fair value because management had determined the impairment was not temporary 
sale of leasing portfolio to cit in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a vendor financing agreement with the cit group  inc cit  whereby cit will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis 
under the terms of the agreement  cit established a wholly owned subsidiary  agilent financial services  inc afs  and is offering financing products to our customers under this name 
cit  through afs  will be providing funding and services related to equipment financing to customers in most of our businesses 
these services include credit review  document generation  pricing  invoicing and collections 
we also entered into an asset purchase agreement with cit pursuant to which we sold them certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets during the fourth quarter of net proceeds from this sales transaction were million and we recognized million in net revenue and million in cost of products 
we will be selling additional portions of our portfolio of lease assets to cit during pursuant to various asset purchase agreements 
sale of healthcare solutions business to philips in the first quarter of  we agreed to sell our healthcare solutions business to koninklijke philips electronics  nv philips for approximately billion 
most of our healthcare solutions business operational facilities and certain associated assets and liabilities will transfer to philips 
virtually all employees of our healthcare solutions business  including percent of the healthcare solutions business dedicated infrastructure employees  will be offered employment by philips or transferred to philips  subject to local statutory laws 
the estimated amount of net assets to be transferred is million 
we will be restricted from competing in the development  manufacturing  selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years 
the sale is expected to be completed by mid calendar year subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
acquisition of osi on january   we acquired objective systems integrators  inc osi for approximately million in cash 
osi is a leading provider of next generation operations support system software for communications service providers and will become part of our test and measurement business 
cyclical business and general economic conditions the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor market  electronics industry  computer industry and telecommunications markets  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had significant impacts on our businesses 
in portions of some of these markets  we have started to see softening which could harm our businesses 
our revenue and operating results for compared to have improved as a result of an upturn in the semiconductor industry 
additionally  as a capital equipment provider  our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses and in the economy 
we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future 
given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed  variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results 
economic conditions in asia beginning in the second half of and continuing into the first half of  our revenue and operating results declined as a result of the downturn in asian economies  particularly in korea and japan 
many of our major customers  particularly those in the semiconductor and electronics industries  delayed or canceled purchases of our products 
this had a significant impact on us  particularly our test and measurement business 
these conditions began to improve in the second half of and  accordingly  our revenue and operating results improved 
impact of foreign currencies we sell our products in many countries and a portion of our sales and a portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially in the japanese yen and the euro 
in compared to  the us dollar strengthened against both the japanese yen and the euro  which had an immaterial effect on our net revenue and operating expense growth 
our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program  which is designed to minimize exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
this statement  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we expect the adoption of fas  during first quarter of  will result in a cumulative after tax expense of million 
additionally  an unrealized gain related to foreign currency hedging of approximately million  net of tax  will be recorded in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this staff accounting bulletin  as amended  is effective no later than the fourth quarter of we currently do not believe the adoption will have a material annual impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations our results of operations for the years ended october   and in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue follow 
as a percentage of dollars total net revenue years ended october  in millions net revenue products    services and other    total net revenue    costs and expenses cost of products    cost of services and other research and development  selling  general and administrative    total costs and expenses    earnings from operations  other income expense  net 

earnings before taxes  provision for taxes net earnings cost of products as a percentage of products revenue cost of services and other as a percentage of services revenue net revenue total net revenue increased percent to billion in from and percent to billion in from excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit  net revenue increased percent in from the increase in was spurred by continued growth in net revenue from the communications and electronics markets 
this was especially due to the robust demand for our test and measurement and semiconductor products  more specifically for our wireless  fiber optics  networking and imaging components 
increased demand in asia also contributed to net revenue growth in these effects were partially offset by a decline in net revenue from our healthcare solutions business 
net revenue for from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to growth in the communications market  improvement in economic conditions in asia and strengthening of the semiconductor industry in general 
united states revenue increased percent to billion in and increased percent to billion in international revenue increased percent to billion in and increased percent to billion in domestic growth came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets which was partially offset by a slowdown in our healthcare solutions business 
the relatively higher net revenue growth internationally was primarily attributable to increased demand in asia  particularly in taiwan  korea and japan 
there was minimal currency impact on net revenue growth in in the last half of and the first half of  economic conditions in asia adversely affected revenue from sales of our products and services to customers in korea and japan 
in addition  global weakness in the semiconductor industry caused our product revenue to decline in and into the first half of these conditions began to improve in the second half of and  accordingly  our revenue improved  both within the united states and internationally 
in compared to  revenue from products increased percent while revenue from services and other increased percent 
in compared to  revenue from products increased percent while revenue from services and other increased percent 
the relatively higher product revenue growth in was primarily due to growth in our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets  a strengthening of the semiconductor industry and increased demand in asia 
generally  there is a lag between service revenue growth and product revenue growth 
this lag occurs because service revenue increases as our installed base of products increases and warranty periods expire 
lower product revenue growth in was primarily due to weak economic conditions in asia and weak demand in the semiconductor industry 
earnings from operations earnings from operations increased percent to billion in from and increased percent to million in from excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit and the restructuring charges related to our healthcare solutions business  earnings from operations increased percent in from the increase in was primarily due to strong results in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses 
these improved results were partially offset by weak performance from our healthcare solutions business  flat performance from our chemical analysis business  additional on going costs associated with operating on our own and previously planned research and development in the life sciences 
the increase in was due to higher net revenue combined with cost savings of approximately million as a result of the restructuring 
also  results included a million asset impairment charge related to a building under construction for the intended purpose of housing manufacturing operations for eight inch cmos semiconductor wafers 
as a percentage of net revenue  cost of products and services decreased percentage points in from and decreased percentage points in from excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit and the impairment charge of million  cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from the decrease in was primarily attributable to higher volumes in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses as well as a more profitable product mix in the semiconductor products business 
the decrease was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies related to parts shortages  manufacturing consolidations and our healthcare solutions business restructuring charges 
in  all four of our business segments recorded improvement in cost of products and services and other as a percentage of net revenue with semiconductor products accounting for the most significant improvement due primarily to cost improvements resulting from the restructuring 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased percentage points in from and percentage points in from the increase in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own and higher marketing costs 
the increase in was due to higher advertising and branding expenses related to our becoming an independent company 
this effect was partially offset by higher net revenue 
research and development expenses increased percent in compared to and percent in compared to these increases reflect ongoing efforts in developing new products and new technologies for the wireless  networking and life sciences markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in from and percent in from the increase in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher marketing costs  including branding expenses 
also  goodwill amortization related to recent acquisitions contributed to the increase in operating expenses in in  expense reductions resulting from the restructuring and other cost containment measures were offset by costs  including product advertising and branding expenses  related to our becoming a stand alone entity 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  increased million to million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to approximately million of gain on sales of equity investments that no longer supported our business strategies and interest income earned on the initial cash funding received from hewlett packard 
included in were gains of million related to the divestiture of several portions of our businesses 
provision for taxes as a result of the impacts of the anticipated sale of our healthcare solutions business  the acquisition of osi and possible changes in our mix of pre tax earnings  our effective tax rate may change 
our future effective tax rates will also continue to be subject to the impacts of business acquisitions and dispositions  as well as changes in the mix of our pre tax earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates 
test and measurement years ended october  dollars in millions net revenue    earnings from operations operating margin net revenue net revenue from our test and measurement business increased percent to billion in from and remained essentially unchanged in from excluding the sale of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit  net revenue increased percent in from the increase in was attributable to strong growth in the sales of our products into the optical  wireless and networking markets 
also  third party manufacturing contractors added capacity to meet demand and increased their purchases of our test and measurement products 
net revenue growth in was negatively affected by weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in asia 
due to competitive pressures and difficult market conditions  we granted more pricing discounts and customer allowances than in previous years 
this impact was partially offset by increased sales volumes of communications products and optical networks in the second half of as market conditions improved 
net revenue from products increased percent in from and decreased percent in from excluding the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit  net revenue from products increased percent in from net revenue from services and other increased percent in from and percent in from the relatively greater product revenue growth in was primarily due to the growing communications market and the increased demand in asia 
generally  there is a lag between service revenue growth and product revenue growth 
this lag occurs because service revenue increases as our installed base of products increases and warranty periods expire 
product revenue decreased in primarily due to weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in asia 
earnings from operations earnings from operations from our test and measurement business increased percent to million in from and increased percent to million in from the increase in resulted primarily from higher net revenue as discussed above 
in  the increase resulted from lower cost of products and services and other partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from and percentage points in from the decrease in was primarily due to higher net revenue partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in our efforts to meet customer demand 
the decrease in was due to cost savings resulting from the restructuring and was partially offset by the effect of lower volumes of products sold  primarily wireless communication test equipment and automated test equipment  and higher service revenue and the associated higher cost of this revenue 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from and increased percentage points in from the decrease in was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses 
the increase in from was due to slightly lower net revenue combined with higher levels of expense 
in  continued savings from cost reduction programs initiated in the second half of partially offset this trend 
however  costs incurred as part of becoming a stand alone entity  particularly costs related to branding moved overall operating expenses higher 
research and development expenses increased percent in compared to and were unchanged in compared to the increase in reflects increased activity in new product development in the communications market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in from and increased percent in from the increase in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher selling and marketing costs including branding expenses 
in  cost reduction programs initiated in slowed overall expense growth and significantly decreased some variable operating costs 
semiconductor products years ended october  dollars in millions net revenue    earnings loss from operations operating margin net revenue net revenue from our semiconductor products business increased percent to billion in from and percent to billion in from the increase in was the result of strong growth in all semiconductor products including wireless  networking and imaging components 
networking component growth was the result of growth in the sales of fiber optic transceivers and high speed networking products tailored for metro area network man  as well as storage area networking products and gigabit ethernet local area network lan applications 
imaging products for digital cameras and optical mice also achieved particularly strong growth in the increase in was achieved despite the sale of the power amplifier business in late if net revenue in were adjusted to exclude revenue of the power amplifier business  net revenue would have increased by percent in over net revenue growth in primarily reflects increased shipments of fiber optics products  application specific integrated circuits asics  motion control products  wireless semiconductor products  and high speed networking products 
as a percentage of net revenue for the semiconductor products business  revenue from sales to hewlett packard  consisting primarily of asics and motion control products  was percent in  percent in and percent in in  we expanded our existing joint venture relationship with philips to develop our manufacturing light emitting diodes led and transferred a portion of our led business into the joint venture 
leds are used for various lighting and display purposes 
since we do not have a majority ownership interest in the joint venture  the revenue  costs and expenses of the led business transferred to the joint venture are no longer consolidated in our results 
instead  we record our portion of the joint venture s net earnings or loss in other income expense  net  which in  was minimal 
adjusting the base for revenues relating to the led business and our exit from the microprocessor business  net revenue growth for would have been percent 
earnings loss from operations earnings from operations from our semiconductor products business increased percent to million in from and increased percent to million in from the increase in resulted from higher net revenue and lower cost of products as a percentage of net revenue  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
the increase in resulted from higher revenue and cost savings from the restructuring 
cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from and decreased percentage points in from adjusting for the impairment charge of million and the transfer of a portion of our led business to philips  cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from the decrease in was primarily related to increased volumes and a more favorable product mix 
adjusting for both the impairment charge and the restructuring  cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased percentage points in from the decrease in resulted from increased sales volumes of asic s and a more profitable product mix  especially higher volumes of fiber optic communications products  motion control devices and microprocessors 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased percentage points in from and decreased percentage point in from the increase in was primarily due to infrastructure costs related to operating on our own and increased research and development costs 
the decrease in was primarily the result of higher net revenue 
research and development expenses increased percent in from and percent in from the increases in both years reflect increased development in the fiber optics  high speed networking  and image and position sensor products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in and were unchanged in from the increase in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher selling and marketing costs  including branding expenses 
healthcare solutions years ended october  dollars in millions net revenue    earnings loss from operations operating margin deficit in the first quarter of  we announced an agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to philips 
see overview section of the md a 
this sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
net revenue net revenue from our healthcare solutions business decreased percent to billion in from and increased percent to billion in from the decrease in was primarily due to a slow down in capital expenditures by us hospitals and increased discounts 
in addition  lower volumes and an unfavorable currency impact in europe contributed to the decline 
also  some of our customers accelerated purchases into to avoid potential year issues 
the increase in was primarily related to strong sales in the second half of from cardiology products and patient monitoring products partially offset by a decline from ultrasound imaging products 
in the first half of  internal production constraints resulting from our transition to a new enterprise resource planning system contributed to the decline in revenue from the ultrasound imaging products and also affected the growth rate in patient monitoring revenue 
these implementation issues have subsequently been resolved 
earnings loss from operations the healthcare solutions business had a loss of million in as compared to earnings of million in and earnings of million in excluding restructuring charges in  our healthcare solutions business had a loss of million 
the decline in earnings in was due to lower net revenue as well as higher costs and expenses 
the increase in was primarily due to higher net revenue  partially offset by higher costs and expenses 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by percentage points in from and decreased percentage points in from the increase in was primarily attributable to lower net revenue resulting from lower volumes and higher discounts as well as higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own 
in addition  costs relating to the restructuring and an unfavorable product mix contributed to this increase 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower overhead  lower product installation costs and a more profitable product mix 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased percentage points in from and decreased percentage points in from the increase in was primarily due to lower net revenue and higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own 
in addition  expenses relating to restructuring and increased goodwill charges related to acquisitions in contributed to the increase 
in  the decrease was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses 
research and development expenses increased percent in from and increased percent in from the increase in was largely a result of on going development projects including the new automatic external defibrillator  ultrasound imaging and web enabled wireless patient monitoring devices 
the increase was largely a result of our efforts to develop new automatic external defibrillator products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in from and percent in from in  the increase was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own 
costs related to our becoming a separate  stand alone entity  including advertising expenses  accounted for approximately half of the increase in from in addition  expenses relating to the restructuring and increased goodwill amortization charges related to acquisitions contributed to the increase 
most of the remainder of the increase in was due to goodwill amortization charges associated with the heartstream acquisition in chemical analysis years ended october  dollars in millions net revenue   earnings from operations operating margin net revenue net revenue from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat at billion in and and increased percent to billion in from in  revenue growth in our products sold to the pharmaceutical and life sciences markets was partially offset by weakness in our traditional chemical and environmental markets 
new product releases contributed to increased sales of our liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products 
services and other revenue was flat in from the net revenue increase in was generated by growth across all product lines and included a percent increase in services and other revenue 
demand within the pharmaceutical industry was especially strong  leading to increased sales of our liquid chromatography products 
in addition  sales to our customers in asia in the second half of increased as economic conditions in the region continued to improve 
earnings from operations earnings from operations from our chemical analysis business decreased percent to million in from and increased percent to million in from the decrease in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to the costs of operating on our own as well as planned research and development in life sciences to launch new products 
the increase in was due primarily to higher net revenue  partially offset by higher costs and expenses 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by percentage points in from and decreased by percentage points in from in  the increase was primarily due to lower volumes  start up costs for life sciences products as well as higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own 
in  the improvement was related to higher volumes  greater manufacturing efficiencies in our mass spectrometer and liquid chromatography product lines and lower warranty costs 
in addition  greater efficiency within the service business accounted for percentage points of the improvement 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased percentage points in from and increased percentage points in from in  the increase resulted primarily from increased life sciences research and development activities  higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own 
the increase in resulted from greater growth in expenses than in net revenue 
research and development expenses increased percent in from and percent in from the increases reflected new product development programs in the life sciences 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in from and percent in from the increase in was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own 
in addition  the increase in was primarily due to higher marketing and field selling costs 
liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents of million at october  prior to november   cash receipts associated with our businesses were transferred to hewlett packard on a daily basis and hewlett packard provided funds to cover our disbursements 
accordingly  we reported no cash or cash equivalents at october  and in accordance with our separation agreement with hewlett packard  as of november   hewlett packard retained some of our assets and liabilities and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business 
in november and december  hewlett packard made cash payments to us totaling billion to fund our working capital and other needs of our operations as a separate  stand alone entity 
in addition  hewlett packard transferred approximately billion to fund our acquisition of yokogawa electric corporation s yokagawa minority interest in agilent technologies japan  ltd 
the net proceeds of our initial public offering of billion were received in november and immediately distributed to hewlett packard as a dividend 
of the total billion received from hewlett packard  billion was classified as net cash provided by financing activities and billion was classified among several categories as net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended october  we generated cash from operations of million in compared to million in and million in in  cash from operations was primarily a result of net earnings and from the sale of certain portions of our us portfolio of lease assets to cit 
in and  cash from operations was primarily a result of net earnings adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
in addition  lower cash from operations in resulted from a significant increase in accounts receivable due to particularly strong shipments in october net cash used by investing activities was  million in compared to million in and million in in all periods  capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from divestitures and the disposal of excess  unused or retired assets constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities 
we used million in to pay for the first and second installments of the purchase of yokagawa s minority interest in agilent technologies japan  ltd and several other companies 
we expect to purchase the remaining of agilent technologies japan  ltd s shares owned by yokogawa prior to january  hewlett packard provided the funding for the yokogawa transaction in november future sales of our portfolio of lease assets to cit are anticipated during we are currently negotiating the details of the future sales agreements 
the financial impacts are not determinable at this time 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to philips for approximately billion 
on january   we acquired osi for approximately million in cash 
cash for this transaction was provided by cash on hand as well as proceeds of our commercial paper and other short term borrowing under our existing credit facilities 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets 
we believe that cash generated from operations and our unused lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and research and development funding requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future 
we cannot assure that additional financing  if needed  will be available on favorable terms 
factors that may affect future results if we do not introduce new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs  price our products competitively  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their new products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
development of new products generally requires a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of these innovations 
our other businesses will encounter similar challenges 
we would suffer competitive harm if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products and technologies that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
if demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity  our earnings may suffer 
demand for our products has put increased pressure on our manufacturing capacity  especially in the wireless and fiber optic areas 
if we are not able to increase our manufacturing capacity in the time necessary to meet demand  if we experience difficulties in obtaining parts or components needed for manufacturing  or if demand exceeds our expectations  we may experience insufficient manufacturing capacity 
if our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decreases  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our earnings 
failure of suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products 
suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
our results may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely manner 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations  particularly in korea and japan  could adversely affect our sales 
since we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
we do a portion of our businesses in korea and japan  which have been subject to increased economic instability in recent years 
our businesses declined in when korea and japan experienced economic difficulties 
the recurrence of weakness in these economies or weakness in other international economies could have a significant negative effect on our future operating results 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  relatively small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter 
for example  when our revenue declined in the second half of as a result of the financial crisis in asia  it caused significant negative fluctuations in our operating results 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products and customers  unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  changes in the timing of product orders  and our inability to forecast revenue in a given quarter from large system sales 
the current technology labor market is very competitive  and our businesses will suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain and expand our businesses 
competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense  and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including the silicon valley region of northern california where our headquarters and central research and development laboratories are located 
although we believe we offer competitive salaries and benefits  certain of our businesses have had to increase spending in order to retain personnel 
our operating results could be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products are in downward cycles 
several significant industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions 
for example  in the operating results of our test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses were harmed by downturns in the semiconductor market 
from time to time  the electronics industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
in addition  we are starting to see a softening in portions of the telecommunications industry and the computer industry 
the computer industry is also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products 
these industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our businesses 
our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected  we may not be able to successfully integrate the companies we acquire and our efforts may divert attention from other business operations 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
although completion of any one transaction may not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows taken as a whole  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
divestiture of a part of our business may result in the cancellation of orders and charges to earnings 
acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate with a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may also have to develop  manufacture and market products with our products in a way that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity into agilent depends on a variety of factors  including the hiring and retention of key employees  management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  and the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
our semiconductor technology licensing and supply arrangements with hewlett packard limit our ability to sell to other companies and could restrict our ability to expand our businesses 
we do not have a license under hewlett packard s patents  patent applications and invention disclosures for  with some exceptions  inkjet products  printer products including printer supplies  accessories and components  document scanners and computing products 
in addition  our icbd technology ownership and license agreement  which generally covers integrated circuit technology that is used in integrated circuits for hewlett packard s printers  scanners and computers  provides that for a period of three years in some cases and years in other cases we are prohibited  with some exceptions  from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products  printer products including printer supplies  accessories and components  document scanners and computing products to third parties other than hewlett packard 
although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to hewlett packard of these kinds of integrated circuits  the supply agreement does not require hewlett packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us 
in the event that hewlett packard reduces its purchase of our integrated circuits  we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers 
if demand for hewlett packard s printer  workstation and server products declines  or if hewlett packard chooses a different supplier  our semiconductor products business revenue will decline significantly 
historically  our semiconductor products business has sold products to hewlett packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of hewlett packard 
for  hewlett packard accounted for of our total net revenue and of our semiconductor products business net revenue  respectively 
in comparison  for  hewlett packard accounted for of our total net revenue and of our semiconductor products business net revenue  respectively 
for  hewlett packard accounted for of our total net revenue and of our semiconductor products business net revenue  respectively 
our ability to compete for hewlett packard s business may suffer as a result of our separation due to decreased access to hewlett packard s research and development strategy  technology plans  future product features and product supply needs 
in the past  we have benefited from our access to hewlett packard s research and development strategy  technology plans  future product features and product supply needs in competing for hewlett packard s business 
if our competitors were to gain better access to hewlett packard as a result of our separation  our competitors may be able to develop products that better meet the future needs of hewlett packard  decreasing the competitiveness of our products 
in addition  we have taken advantage of collaborative relationships with some of hewlett packard s businesses and we may not continue to enjoy all of the benefits of these collaborative relationships 
we may face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations in the manufacture  processing and distribution of chemicals  and  if we fail to comply  we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or be prohibited from distributing our products 
some of our chemical analysis business products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture  processing and distribution are regulated by the united states environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act  and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act 
we must conform the manufacture  processing and distribution of these chemicals to these laws  and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  then we could be made to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
the medical device products produced by our healthcare solutions business are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and similar international agencies 
their regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
in the first quarter of  we announced a definitive agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to philips 
the sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 
in addition  our chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the toxic substances control act  the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and similar regulations 
therefore  we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations 
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved 
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlett packard for known subsurface contamination 
hewlett packard has agreed to retain the liability for all known subsurface contamination  perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
in addition  hewlett packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation 
while hewlett packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties  remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties 
we cannot assure you that hewlett packard will fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations 
we are indemnifying hewlett packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hewlett packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hewlett packard 
while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with existing subsurface contamination at any of those properties  subsurface contamination may exist  and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 
environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 
our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state and local laws governing the environment 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states  even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and our failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our businesses 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the terms of government contracts 
we have received and are complying with formal requests for information by the government regarding our sales of products to some of the government agencies with which we have contracted 
these requests may result in legal proceedings against us or liability which may be significant 
we and our customers are subject to various other governmental regulations  and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop our products to be compatible with these regulations 
several of our product lines are subject to other significant international  federal  state and local  health and safety  packaging  product content and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or remedy past violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of portions or all of our operations  impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the united states federal communications commission 
we also must comply with work safety rules 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our businesses will be harmed 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products and services 
moreover  in connection with future intellectual property infringement claims  we will only have the benefit of asserting counterclaims based on hewlett packard s intellectual property portfolio in limited circumstances  and we will only be able to offer licenses to hewlett packard s intellectual property in order to resolve claims in limited circumstances 
in addition  although we believe we have all necessary rights to use the new brand name  our rights to use it may be challenged by others 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses 
we cannot assure you that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses may change as a result of our separation from hewlett packard 
our patent cross license agreement with hewlett packard gives us a conditional right to sublicense only a portion of hewlett packard s intellectual property portfolio 
as a result  in negotiating patent cross license agreements with third parties  we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could sublicense hewlett packard s entire intellectual property portfolio 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
if our factories or facilities were to experience catastrophic loss due to earthquake  our operations would be seriously harmed 
several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their location 
we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity  such as our production facilities  headquarters and agilent laboratories in california and our production facilities in washington and japan 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 
agilent self insures against such losses and does not carry catastrophic insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from earthquakes 
we currently still use some of hewlett packard s information systems  and we are in the process of developing our own information systems 
we currently use hewlett packard s systems to support a portion of our operations  mainly customer support and networks 
we have an agreement with hewlett packard for hewlett packard to continue to provide these information services to us through the end of during this time period  while we are developing our own systems  we will be dependent on hewlett packard for the provision of these information technology services that are critical to running our businesses 
many of the systems we currently use are proprietary to hewlett packard and are very complex 
we are in the process of creating our own information systems to eventually replace hewlett packard s systems 
we may not be successful in implementing these systems and transitioning data from hewlett packard s systems to ours 
we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage some of our information systems 
the transitional services being provided to us by hewlett packard may not be sufficient to meet our needs  and we may pay increased costs to replace these services after our agreements with hewlett packard expire 
hewlett packard has agreed to provide certain transitional services to us  including services related to information technology systems  buildings and facilities  and administrative services 
these services may not be provided at the same level as when we were part of hewlett packard  and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits 
we also lease and sublease certain office and manufacturing facilities from hewlett packard 
these transitional service and leasing arrangements generally have a term of less than two years following the separation 
after the expiration of these various arrangements  we may not be able to replace the transitional services or enter into appropriate leases in a timely manner or on terms and conditions  including cost  as favorable as those we receive from hewlett packard 
these agreements were made in the context of a parent subsidiary relationship and were negotiated in the overall context of our separation from hewlett packard 
as a result  some of these agreements may have terms and conditions that are less specific than some agreements that are negotiated at arms length 
the prices charged to us under these agreements may be different from the prices that we may be required to pay third parties for similar services or the costs of similar services if we undertake them ourselves 
our historical and financial information may not be representative of our results as a separate company 
the historical and financial information we have included has been carved out from hewlett packard s consolidated financial statements and does not reflect what our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been  had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
hewlett packard did not account for us as  and we were not operated as  a single stand alone entity for the and periods presented 
in addition  the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
we did not make adjustments to reflect the many significant changes that will occur in our cost structure  funding and operations as a result of our separation from hewlett packard  including changes in our employee base  changes in our tax structure  increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale  increased marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand identity and increased costs associated with being a public  stand alone company 
we may have potential business conflicts of interest with hewlett packard with respect to our past and ongoing relationships that could harm our business operations 
conflicts of interest may arise between hewlett packard and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships  including labor  tax  employee benefit  indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from hewlett packard  intellectual property matters  employee retention and recruiting  major business combinations involving us  and the nature  quality and pricing of transitional services hewlett packard has agreed to provide us 
nothing restricts hewlett packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to hewlett packard by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our exposure to exchange rate risks has been managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
