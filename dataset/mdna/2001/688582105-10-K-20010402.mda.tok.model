the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december    and net revenues consolidated net revenues in were  as compared to  in in december  one of our clients purchased  of grafton r dbm in advance of the january  price increase  but we deferred recognition of the revenue until the first quarter of in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  specifically staff accounting bulletin revenues in included a  purchase of grafton r dbm in advance of a january  price increase 
the grafton r dbm purchase was not required to be deferred in accordance with gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin domestic net revenues  which consist principally of revenues from the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments  were  in as compared to  in revenues from bio implants increased in offsetting the decline in base allograft tissue processing revenues  which resulted from a decline in the number of donors processed  and a decline in domestic grafton r dbm revenues 
foreign net revenues were  in compared to  in revenues associated with the european introduction of grafton r dbm and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenue offset decreased revenues from bovine tissue sales and ceramic and titanium coating services 
consolidated net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase was principally due to higher revenues in both the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
domestic net revenues  which consist principally of revenues from the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments  increased to  from  in foreign revenues increased to  from  in the increase in foreign net revenues resulted primarily from our january acquisition of ost 
grafton r dbm segment net revenues in were  as compared to  in grafton r dbm segment revenues were positively affected by the introduction of grafton r dbm in europe  which offset a decrease in domestic revenues 
in addition  revenues included  of grafton r dbm purchased by our clients in december  in advance of the january  price increase  while revenue recognition of a similar december   purchase of grafton r dbm by one of our clients was deferred until in accordance with gaap and sec staff accounting bulleting in  grafton r dbm faced and we expect it will continue to face  increasing competition as more companies develop products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
base tissue segment net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase was principally due to a increase in bio implant processing revenues and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in base allograft tissue processing revenues as a result of a decline in the number of donors processed  due in part to the decline in base tissue needs of surgeons as they shift to using more highly advanced tissues such as our line of graftech tm bio implants 
grafton r dbm segment net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase resulted from increased demand for grafton r dbm 
base tissue segment net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase occurred as a result of increased unit volume of allograft bone tissue processed for our clients 
during   and  two of our clients in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments accounted for and  and  and and  respectively  of consolidated net revenues 
we have processing agreements with each of these clients which expire in august  and december   respectively 
the agreement which expires in august  may be terminated by either party commencing in march   or any date thereafter upon giving six months prior written notice 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  in  and in the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in resulted primarily from the underabsorption of costs related to increased capacity  new processing technologies  a decline in the number of donors processed  and allograft bone tissue forms that have not yet achieved revenue levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs while they are in launch mode 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in results from the absorption of costs associated with additional allograft tissue processing capacity which was added to meet the anticipated growth in our allograft tissue business  and a decline in the percentage of consolidated revenues coming from the grafton r dbm segment  which has a higher gross profit than other services and products 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new allograft tissue processing facility in eatontown  new jersey which is expected to be in use during the second half of  see item  properties and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect that the incremental expenses associated with this facility will only be partially offset by increased volume in  and therefore consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in is expected to decline slightly from the level achieved in marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in to  from  in in  marketing  general and administrative expenses were higher than expenses of  in  this increase is primarily due to increases in legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  see part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  especially with respect to new bio implant tissue forms 
the increase in was primarily attributable to incremental agent commissions resulting from increased volume in the grafton r dbm segment  expanded marketing and promotional activities associated with the launch of two new products  the bio d tm threaded cortical bone dowel which is included in the base tissue segment and the sscs tm system  increased legal fees associated with patent infringement lawsuits  and the inclusion of ost s operating expenses 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property 
as a result we are currently involved in four patent lawsuits 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is expensive and has had  and will likely have  a negative impact on our operating results 
however  we believe it is necessary to defend our technology and related intellectual property in which we invest significant amounts of money to develop 
research and development expenses consolidated research and development expenses increased in to  from  in research and development expenses in were higher than research and development expenses of  these increases were primarily attributable to increased spending in the grafton r dbm and the base tissue segments associated with the continued development of several new processing technologies  development of new allograft bone tissue forms  specifically new bio implant tissue forms  and ongoing support for existing products and services 
income from litigation settlement in november   we settled all claims which we had filed against depuy in the patent infringement lawsuit against gensci labs and gensci sciences 
as part of the settlement  depuy has agreed to stop selling the gensci products accused of infringing our patents no later than february  and to pay us  we received payments and recognized income  of  in each quarter of and a payment of  in the fourth quarter of  of which  and  was recognized in income in the third and fourth quarters  respectively  of operating income consolidated operating income decreased in to  from  in primarily as a result of declines in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments 
in  consolidated operating income was higher than operating income of  grafton r dbm segment operating income decreased in to  from  in primarily due to lower gross margins due to underabsorption of costs  increased legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  and a decrease of  in patent litigation settlement payments 
in grafton r dbm segment operating income was higher than operating income of  principally due to increased revenues and  in  the litigation settlement with depuy 
base tissue segment operating income decreased in to  from  in as a result of lower gross margins due to underabsorption of costs  increased legal fees associated with patent lawsuits  and increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  especially with respect to new bio implant tissue forms 
base tissue segment operating income in was  other segment operating income declined in to a loss of  and declined in to a loss of  from a loss of  in other income expense in  other income increased  to  other income decreased  in principally due to lower interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate in was and was in and the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the non recognition for tax purposes of foreign operating losses and the impact of domestic state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest our excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital decreased  to  at december  compared to  at december  the decrease resulted primarily from utilization of cash and short term investments to partially fund capital expenditures  including construction of the new allograft tissue processing facility  and the purchase and retirement of  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction of income tax benefits related to stock options  partially offset by increased non cash charges  principally depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities increased to  in from  in the increase is due to an increase in capital expenditures to  from  resulting from our continued investment in facilities and equipment needed for current and future business requirements 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced construction of a new allograft tissue processing facility in eatontown  new jersey 
see item properties and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated aggregate cost for the construction of the facility  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  is approximately  a portion of the aggregate construction costs have been  and will continue to be  funded through a  building mortgage loan and an equipment line of credit of  the remaining balance will be funded through available cash reserves or anticipated cash flow from operations 
through december   we have incurred  of capital expenditures  including capitalized interest of  related to the new allograft tissue processing facility  of which  has been funded through bank financing 
net cash provided by financing activities in increased to  from  in the increase results principally from increased borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by a reduction of cash proceeds received from stock option exercises and the purchase and retirement of  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of in june   we replaced our then existing domestic lines of credit with a credit facility that includes a  revolving line of credit  a  building mortgage loan and a  equipment line of credit 
at december    was outstanding under the building mortgage and  was outstanding under the equipment line of credit 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
we also have a line of credit with a dutch bank  which provides for borrowings of up to dfl  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
additionally  we have a line of credit with a french bank which provides for borrowings of up to frf  or approximately  at the december  exchange rate 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under either the dutch or french credit lines 
at december   certain of our foreign based subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating  at the december  exchange rate  with no expiration date   expiring through 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  and february   we entered into two distribution agreements 
we will market pursuant to these agreements  vbr tm and  a pedicle screw system and a cervical plating system  respectively 
these agreements require us to make minimum purchase commitments over the next two years of  and  respectively 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and available lines of credit  together with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our near term requirements 
from time to time  we may seek additional funds through equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to us or  if available  that such funds will be available to us on favorable terms 
recent developments in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe adoption of sfas no 
will have no effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings involving product liability and patent infringement claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters see  part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
risk factors we are dependent upon two primary clients who provide the bulk of our revenues 
we are the processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf and arc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
we entered into a year exclusive processing agreement with arc in december  and a five year processing agreement with mtf in september  however  the mtf contract may be canceled effective march  and thereafter upon either party giving six months prior written notice 
the loss of either mtf or arc as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for either entity would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently in litigation with mtf 
see item legal proceedings 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion 
our allograft bone tissue processing business primarily depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients and tro s who recover donated human cadaveric tissue for us 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons to donate  or may not be willing to provide  sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
our ability to secure enough donor tissue to meet our demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competitive threats from firms with greater financial resources and lower costs 
the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers and allograft bone tissue processed by others  primarily tissue banks 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still maintains approximately a share of the united states bone graft market 
in europe  bone graft substitutes  such as bovine bone tissue and synthetics  currently comprise most of the bone grafting market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others and bone graft substitutes 
in recent years  our grafton r dbm products have faced increasing competitive pressures as more companies have developed  or have announced they are developing  products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
many of these competitors have research and development  marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours 
they also offer a full line of metal implants and other products used in spinal surgeries 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us since they can offer surgeons a more complete line of products than we currently can 
we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
substantially all of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
although we believe  based upon our knowledge of the industry  that we process bone tissue from more donors than any other processor in the world  we can not assure you that we will continue to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing 
we are currently involved in patent litigation which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we may become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we are currently involved in four litigations involving our patents and patents held by certain of our competitors 
prosecuting and defending these lawsuits is very expensive and these expenses have had  and are likely to have  an adverse affect on our results of operations 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
in addition  the industry in which we compete is known for having a great deal of litigation involving patents 
these factors could cause us to become involved in additional patent litigations in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose those litigations in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose those litigations in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the course of the patent litigations in which we are involved  interim information about the status of each of these litigations may be released 
although these interim releases may differ from the final determinations in these litigations  such information may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems 
the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges for the processing of allograft bone tissue  depends upon our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from their clients  which are typically medical institutions 
the ability of medical institutions to pay fees to our clients  or directly to us for allograft bone tissue or non allograft spinal implant systems distributed directly by us to the medical institutions  depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
the medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products 
we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to be based primarily upon the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  neurological and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
although our education and marketing efforts to date have enabled us to expand our business  our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand 
governmental regulation of organ transplantation could restrict the use of our products 
in the united states the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue are subject to federal regulation pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas  with the exception of removal and implantation 
we and other allograft bone tissue processors are engaged in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and we will continue to expand our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits reimbursement of these costs as costs associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue products  our inability to be reimbursed for our education efforts in the future could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
in various countries outside the united states  national laws and regulations restrict or control the availability and or use of tissues 
there can be no assurance that more restrictive laws  regulations or interpretations will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations in those countries 
loss of key persons could limit our success 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
we consider our allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and rely primarily on trade secrets and patents to protect our technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects which have been independently developed by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our existing or future products and technologies could be found to infringe the patents of others 
we are currently involved in four lawsuits in which we are accused of infringing patents held by others 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
our products face competitive threats from alternate technologies 
the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes as compared to allograft bone tissue is that they do not depend on the availability of donated human tissue 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and recombinant bone growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our spray coating  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition 
our plasma spray coatings  ha products and bovine tissue products operations face intense competition in europe from divisions and subsidiaries of several large corporations engaged in providing such services and products to others and from several smaller independent companies 
in addition  we also face competition from medical implant companies which have in house plasma spray coating operations 
we compete primarily on the quality of our coatings  bovine tissue products and our prices 
we believe that the spraying technology we use  which is computer controlled and utilizes robotics  enables us to provide high quality coatings at competitive prices 
you should note  however  that the industries in which we compete in europe are highly competitive  certain of our competitors have greater resources than we do  and we may be unable to compete successfully 
we may incur losses from product liability lawsuits 
the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue  bovine tissue products and the implantation of medical devices coated with our ha powder or titanium and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue they distribute which is caused by our processing 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us or all types of liabilities which may be asserted against us 
we face potential lawsuits or governmental enforcement activities based on hazardous waste we generate in our operations 
our allograft bone tissue processing in both the united states and europe generates waste  which  in the united states  is classified as medical hazardous waste by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate such waste and dispose of it through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations in both the united states and europe 
the production of ha powder at our facility in the netherlands generates small amounts of hazardous waste  which we segregate and dispose of through a licensed hazardous waste transporter although we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations  our failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  fines and or sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
