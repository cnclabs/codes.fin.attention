under the credit agreement  the company may elect a base rate  an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor  a cost of funds rate and a bid rate 
the base rate is the greater of abn amro bank nv s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum 
the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from to basis points depending on the company s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios 
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on abn amro bank nv s then cost of funds 
under the bid rate option  any participating bank may propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds  which rate may either be a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor 
the credit agreement limits the company s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions  subject to certain exceptions

the interest rate swap agreements mature in and the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties

the company is highly leveraged and its debt service obligations will continue to be substantial 
the debt of the company requires the dedication of a substantial portion of future cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for capital expenditures and future business opportunities that the company believes are available 
the company believes  based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements 
if the company s sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing  if available  would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place
