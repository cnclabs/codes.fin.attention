unit volumes were down percent so the dollar sales increase came from a percent increase in average sales prices 
the big improvement in gross profits resulted from the higher prices and strong markets for stainless pipe in the first half of the year when our distributors were building inventories ahead of anticipated price increases 
the last half of suffered from a reversal to a mode of inventory liquidation among our distributors as prices began to trend downward 
selling and administrative expenses declined  or two percent  and improved slightly as a percent of sales compared with last year primarily from the elimination of administration costs incurred at the camden facility  which was closed in the first half of see note b to consolidated financial statements 
the special charge was recorded in the first quarter for the costs of closing the process equipment plant in camden  south carolina 
in addition   was added to the reserve for environmental remediation in the fourth quarter

comparison of to sales increased percent producing the  increase in operating income to  after six consecutive quarters of declines in unit volume growth compared to the same quarter the previous year  the final three quarters of experienced significant increases resulting in a percent increase in unit volumes over the unit volume increase came primarily from commodity stainless pipe sales resulting from improved demand in the united states coupled with an increase in demand world wide and a reduction of imports following anti dumping judgments on stainless steel 
the most important development in the metals segment during was the reversal of the relentless downtrend in stainless commodity pipe prices that had been evident since late when prices bottomed in the second quarter  they were barely half of the level reached in average prices gained eight percent in the fourth quarter ending the year with a nine percent decline for the year compared to last year 
the fourth quarter increase came from the company s ability to pass along price increases incurred from its stainless steel suppliers 
piping systems and process equipment sales also improved significantly as unit volumes increased nine percent in over the prior year 
gross profits in almost doubled to  compared to as a result of the increase in unit volume offset somewhat by the selling price decline 
selling and administrative expenses were seven percent of sales  consistent with last year 
higher sales commissions  profit based incentives and an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts accounted for the percent increase over the prior year

reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements 
chemicals segment special charges adjusted amounts in amount amount amount amount amount thousands net sales     cost of goods sold      gross profit     selling and administrative expense     operating loss income before environmental remediation costs     environmental remediation costs    operating loss income    colors group special charges adjusted amounts in amount amount amount amount amount thousands net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     selling and administrative expense     operating loss income before before environmental remediation costs   environmental remediation costs    operating loss income   specialty chemicals group special charges adjusted amounts in amount amount amount amount amount thousands net sales     cost of goods sold      gross profit     selling and administrative expense     operating loss income    augusta operating losses   operating loss income excluding augusta losses   comparison of to the chemicals segment experienced a sales decline of seven percent for the year and an operating loss of  before deducting special charges totaling  and  in environmental remediation costs 
sales were down nine percent in the colors group 
the decline in sales resulted from a continuation of the trends that have been evident since of reduced unit volume demand and lower sales prices 
lower unit volume is the result of the downsizing in the domestic textile industry in response to cheap imports that have continued to capture a larger share of the market 
lower dye prices are primarily the result of increasing amounts of cheap imports from china and india and the intensely competitive market conditions 
the lower gross profit margins were due to the same factors that affected sales plus expected losses on our new line of vat dyes during the initial year of introduction 
the losses suffered from the development of our new line of vat dyes was an expected result of our strategy to provide all of the major dyes for coloring cotton which is the number one fiber used by the domestic textile industry 
although selling and administrative expense declined  consistent with the decline in sales  the poor gross profit performance resulted in the colors group having a  operating loss before the special and environmental charges 
the special charge was an inventory charge recorded to cover price decreases and off standard raw materials 
the environmental charges resulted from a revised estimate of the ultimate cost of sites remediation primarily at the augusta plant that is scheduled for closing in for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
the specialty chemicals group sales were down five percent for the year 
the operating loss before special charges of  for the year was caused by losses at the augusta plant of  excluding augusta  operating income before the special charges was  for the year  which represents a decrease from the prior period of  the significant decrease was primarily the result of higher raw material and utility costs  resulting from higher oil prices  which could not be passed on to our customers because of competitive conditions 
also contributing to the decreased profitability were modestly higher labor and overhead costs and a less favorable product mix 
the special charges include a  write off of fixed assets largely related to the discontinuance of a contract processing agreement covering a herbicide intermediate 
the write off amount was recorded net of a note receivable totaling  which will reimburse the company for part of the capital cost  and will be received in equal payments through june most of the equipment was at the augusta plant and management had originally planned to move it to the spartanburg plant 
however  in december  an agreement was reached to cancel the project 
during the second quarter of we expect to discontinue production at the augusta plant after completing our product supply obligations 
a  provision has been recorded to cover the costs related to the shut down 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  for cleaning up a chemical spill 
closing the augusta plant positions the company to better utilize its remaining facilities  which is expected to enhance future profitability 
see note b to consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expense increased  or four percent  and one percent of sales compared to primarily from increases in salary expense and corporate cost allocations 
comparison of to the chemicals segment experienced a sales decline of two percent for the year and operating income fell significantly to  from s total of  before deducting a  special charge for environmental remediation costs 
colors sales were down six percent 
without the acquisition of organic pigments on july   total chemicals segment sales would have declined percent and colors sales would have been down percent 
the decline resulted from the continued downsizing of the domestic textile industry  weak domestic demand and lower selling prices 
sales of specialty chemicals improved three percent because of higher demand from several toll projects during compared to this modest increase is well below the growth rate that the company expects from these products 
unprecedented problems with the start up of a herbicide intermediate under a processing agreement led to a significant commitment of time and resources in with negligible related revenues 
the combination of weaker pricing and demand for color products  low level of capacity utilization in both colors and specialty chemicals  and to a lesser extent  the startup problems mentioned above contributed to the decline in gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses increased six percent over the prior year because of having a full year of expense from the organic acquisition compared to six months last year  and an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts 
for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of these items 
comparison of to the  increase  or percent increase in corporate expenses resulted primarily from two factors 
included in the special charges is an unexpected  payment made under a contract related to a pre employment matter recorded in the first quarter of in addition   in outside consulting costs was amortized during related to the installation of a new data processing system currently being installed 
other expense  net increased  as interest expense increased  from increases in borrowings and interest rates under the lines of credit with a bank 
interest income also declined  due to the company having lower amounts of funds invested in compared to comparison of to the percent increase in corporate expenses resulted from salary increases and higher profit based incentives 
interest expense offset by interest income was higher in  as borrowings increased under the line of credit with a bank  and interest income declined 
the company had borrowings under the line of credit throughout compared to having cash invested most of current conditions and outlook the metals segment sales in the fourth quarter were down percent from a year earlier to  with unit volumes down percent while sales prices were up nine percent 
operating income before the environmental charge totaled  showing a smaller percent decline 
on a sequential basis  the fourth quarter showed good improvement with sales up eight percent and operating income more than double the third quarter level when inventory destocking was most intense 
because the backlog of  is down percent from a year earlier  the piping systems division will have to book a sufficient amount of new business in order for the division to achieve the same level of sales and profits from these products in as it did in domestic economic conditions have a direct impact on the demand for commodity pipe and piping systems 
currently  there are indications that the domestic economy may be deteriorating which could negatively impact demand and the segment s results in however  we believe our performance was significantly better than any domestic competitor and that we are positioned to remain the largest and most profitable domestic stainless pipe producer 
sales were up two percent in the colors group to  in the fourth quarter from a year earlier 
however  colors suffered an operating loss before the special charges of  for the quarter compared to a  loss in the same quarter last year 
the continued profit decline was the result of the conditions outlined in the chemicals segment discussions 
as stated previously  the losses suffered from the development of our new line of vat dyes was an expected result of our strategy to provide all of the major dyes for coloring cotton which is the number one fiber used by the domestic textile industry 
we now supply our customers with vat  sulfur  reactive and azoic dyes as well as pigments 
no competitor furnishes such a complete range of products for coloring cotton fibers 
we augment these products with a line of disperse dyes used to color polyester  the second largest fiber used by the domestic textile industry 
this positions us well to maximize the volume we can generate from the shrinking number of domestic textile producers 
the specialty chemicals group sales were down six percent for the fourth quarter because of the general slowdown in the chemical industry 
the operating loss before the special charges of  for the fourth quarter was caused by losses at the augusta plant of  excluding augusta  operating income before charges was  in the fourth quarter  which represents a  decrease from the fourth quarter of the causes of the declines in sales and profits are consistent with those outlined previously 
most of the products produced at the augusta plant are being transferred to the spartanburg facility 
management expects the closure to reduce operating variances and  accordingly  enhance future earnings 
in the third quarter of  the company expects to complete the installation of hydrogenation and distillation equipment at its spartanburg plant which will complete the transfer of products produced in augusta to spartanburg 
during the last half of  management reviewed all of our businesses with the goal of eliminating any positions not essential to current activities 
at february  our employee count had been reduced to  which was down percent from the january level of closing of the augusta plant will soon result in further reductions 
management currently has an increased emphasis on reducing the capital utilized by each of the business units 
we expect to generate substantial cash flow from these efforts during the first half of  primarily from inventory reductions 
we recognize that any business that cannot produce profits at least equal to the cost of capital should be rationalized in some manner 
the company looked at several acquisition opportunities in but was unable to find a related business at an acceptable price 
we will continue examining acquisition opportunities as well as considering any transaction that is deemed advantageous to the long term interest of our shareholders
