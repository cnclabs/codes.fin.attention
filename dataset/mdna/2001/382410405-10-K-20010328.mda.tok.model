accounting matters the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amended certain provisions of sfas no 
effective january   the company must recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
a derivative instrument meeting certain conditions may be designated as a hedge of a specific exposure  accounting for changes in a derivative s fair value will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
changes in a derivative fair value for a qualifying hedge of forecasted transactions will be deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs  at which time the derivative value will be recognized in earnings 
transition adjustments resulting from adopting this statement will be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk debt and debt related derivatives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term and long term debt with variable interest rates 
based on the overall interest rate exposure on variable rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  hedging activity the company enters into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of its production 
the company considers these to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in its oil and natural gas sales 
the company s strategy  which is reviewed periodically by its board of directors  has been to hedge between and of its production 
most of the company s hedging arrangements are in the form of costless collars  whereby a floor and a ceiling are fixed 
it is the company s belief that the benefits of the downside protection afforded by these costless collars outweigh the costs incurred by losing potential upside when commodity prices increase 
on january   the company adopted a formal policy with respect to hedging arrangements in accordance with accounting pronouncements 
the company does not expect its hedging policy or future hedging practice to differ materially from its historical practice to hedge a portion of its production ranging from to in order to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations in prices 
the company will not engage in speculative activity not supported by production 
the company s futures contract agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet crude oil and natural gas futures contacts 
the company has contracts which contain specific price ranges or collars that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract price or price ranges and the average nymex prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the average nymex price exceeds the contract price  the company pays the difference  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the average nymex price  the company receives the difference 
as of december   the company s open forward position on its outstanding crude oil was as follows a barrels of oil per day with a no cost collar of and per barrel through december  and b barrels of oil per day with a no cost collar of and per barrel through december  the fair value of the crude oil hedging contracts in place at december   resulted in a liability of  as of december   the company s natural gas hedging contracts were as follows a mmbtu per day with a no cost collar of and per mmbtu through december   b mcf per day swap at per mcf for january  c mcf per day swap at per mcf for february  and d mcf per day swap at per mcf for march the fair value of the natural gas hedging contracts in place at december   would result  if not accounted for as hedges  in a liability of the company has the option to terminate its outstanding oil and natural gas hedging contracts by paying the amount of the liability 
the company does not anticipate terminating any of its open contacts

price fluctuations and the volatile nature of markets despite the measures the company has taken to attempt to control price risk  it remains subject to price fluctuations for oil and natural gas sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold in the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond the company s control 
oil and natural gas prices can change dramatically primarily as a result of the balance between supply and demand 
the trend since has been upward  with an average natural gas price received for the year ending december   of per mcf  up from per mcf in and per mcf in the company s average oil price received for the year ended december   was  up from an average price received of in and in there can be no assurance that prices will not decline from current levels 
declines in domestic oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimates and such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
