item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating results compared to results of operations net loss was  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of  for the year ended december  net loss for included a pre tax charge of approximately  related to increasing reserves for patient care liability costs see operating and administrative expenses  as well as pre tax charges totaling approximately  for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items as described below 
net loss for included special pre tax charges of approximately  related to the settlements of  and investigation costs related to  the allocation investigations  as well as pre tax charges totaling approximately  for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items see compared to results of operations 
during  we recorded pre tax charges totaling approximately  including  for asset impairments   for workforce reductions and  for other unusual items 
the asset impairment charges of  primarily related to write down of goodwill of  and property and equipment of  on certain under performing outpatient therapy clinics having operating losses for the past three years and expected future operating losses 
management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by each clinic and reduced the carrying value to its estimate of fair value 
management calculated the fair values of the impaired clinics by using the present value of estimated future cash flows 
these assets were included in the total assets of beverly care alliance 
write down of property and equipment of  and recording of closing and other costs of  related to six nursing facilities with an aggregate carrying value of approximately  that management plans on closing  or terminating the leases on  during these assets generated pre tax losses of approximately  during the year ended december  and were included in the total assets of beverly healthcare 
management calculated the fair values of these facilities by using the present value of estimated future cash flows  or its best estimate of what these facilities  or similar facilities in that state  would sell for in the open market 
write off of abandoned projects totaling  write off of an investment in a physician practice management company of  and reversal of  of prior year asset impairment charges see compared to results of operations 
the workforce reduction charges of  primarily related to severance agreements associated with seven executives 
approximately  was paid during  and the remainder is expected to be paid during the first quarter of four of the executives were notified in late that their positions would be eliminated as part of a reorganization of our operating and support group functions 
such reorganization was formally announced in the first quarter of the purpose of the reorganization is to improve the level of service provided to our nursing facilities and other business units see part i  item business 
we currently estimate that an additional pre tax charge of approximately  will be recognized during the first quarter of related to this reorganization 
income taxes we had an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december   compared to an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the annual effective tax rate for was different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to amortization of nondeductible goodwill and state income taxes  partially offset by the benefit of certain tax credits 
amortization of nondeductible goodwill was impacted by the write down of goodwill on certain under performing outpatient therapy clinics as discussed above 
the annual effective tax rate for was different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of  for income tax purposes which expire in years through and general business tax credit carryforwards of  for income tax purposes which expire in years through for financial reporting purposes  the federal net operating loss carryforwards and the general business tax credit carryforwards have been utilized to offset existing net taxable temporary differences reversing during the carryforward periods 
our net deferred tax assets at december  will be realized through the reversal of temporary taxable differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies  as needed 
we have relied on various factors to conclude that it is more likely than not that our future results of operations and or tax planning strategies coupled with the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
our results of operations for the last three years are not reflective of our future earnings potential 
our results of operations have been negatively impacted by the occurrence of several events that are not anticipated to recur in future periods 
the act phased in the medicare prospective payment system  which was effective for us on january  we experienced a reduction in our net operating revenues of approximately  as compared to as a result of the act 
however  we experienced an increase in our net operating revenues as compared to related to the impact of bbra  and we anticipate that our net operating revenues for as compared to will increase approximately  as a result of the bipa provisions 
our results of operations for the last three years have also included pre tax charges totaling approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
these pre tax charges primarily related to increasing reserves for patient care liability costs  asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items  as well as special charges related to settlements of federal government investigations and year remediation costs as discussed herein 
given the significant effects the above unusual charges and events had on our recent results of operations  we believe our expectation of future income is reasonable 
in addition  we are exploring strategic alternatives  including the possible divestiture  for our nursing home operations in florida  where we have incurred significant patient care liability costs 
we would expect a positive impact on our future core operating results due to the divestiture of our florida nursing operations  however  no assurances can be made of the ultimate impact of the sale of these operations on our future consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if additional income above that produced by ordinary and recurring operations is needed to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets  we could enter into sale leaseback transactions involving operating assets that would accelerate reversal of taxable temporary differences 
therefore  we do not believe that a deferred tax valuation allowance is necessary at december  net operating revenues we reported net operating revenues of  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in approximately and of our total net operating revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services provided by beverly healthcare 
the increase in net operating revenues of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  consists of the following an increase of  due to facilities which the company operated during each of the years ended december  and same facility operations  an increase of  due to acquisitions and openings of newly constructed facilities  partially offset by a decrease of  due to dispositions 
the increase in net operating revenues of  from same facility operations related to the following  due to an increase in medicaid  medicare and private rates   due to one additional calendar day during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  and  due primarily to prior year cost report related settlements and various other items 
such increases were partially offset by decreases of  due to lower revenues from outpatient rehabilitation services primarily resulting from increased contractual adjustments   due to lower revenues from home care services  and  due to a decline in same facility occupancy to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in net operating revenues increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to acquisitions which occurred during the years ended december  and during  we acquired seven nursing facilities  beds  one previously leased nursing facility beds and certain other assets 
also during such period  we opened four newly constructed nursing facilities beds 
during  we purchased three outpatient therapy clinics  two home care centers  two nursing facilities beds  one previously leased nursing facility beds and certain other assets 
in addition  we opened eight newly constructed nursing facilities beds and three assisted living centers units during the acquisitions of the facilities and other assets were accounted for as purchases 
the operations of the acquired facilities and other assets  as well as the newly constructed facilities  were immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
net operating revenues decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to dispositions that occurred during the years ended december  and during  we sold  closed or terminated the leases on nursing facilities  beds and certain other assets 
we recognized net pre tax gains  which were included in net operating revenues during the year ended december   of approximately  as a result of these dispositions 
during  we sold or terminated the leases on nursing facilities  beds  one assisted living center units  home care centers and certain other assets 
we recognized net pre tax losses  which were included in net operating revenues during the year ended december   of approximately  as a result of these dispositions 
the operations of the disposed facilities and other assets were immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
operating and administrative expenses we reported operating and administrative expenses of  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase of approximately  consists of the following an increase of  from same facility operations  an increase of  due to acquisitions and openings of newly constructed facilities  partially offset by a decrease of  due to dispositions 
operating and administrative expenses increased  from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to the following  increase in wages and related expenses primarily due to an increase in our weighted average wage rate   increase in wages and related expenses due to increased use of contract nursing personnel   due primarily to increases in allowances for uncollectible patient accounts receivable   due to an increase in our provision for insurance and related items  and  due to an increase in other contracted services 
our weighted average wage rate and use of contract nursing personnel increased in as compared to many of our nursing facilities are having increasing difficulties attracting nursing aides  assistants and other personnel 
we continue to address this challenge through several recruiting and retention programs and training initiatives 
no assurance can be given that these programs and training initiatives will improve or stabilize our ability to attract these nursing and related personnel 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care services 
such provisions are made based upon the results of independent actuarial valuations and other information available  including management s best judgements and estimates 
however  such provision and liability have been difficult to estimate and have been escalating in recent periods 
based on a study completed by an independent actuarial firm  we recorded a pre tax charge during the third quarter of of approximately  related to increasing reserves for patient care liability costs  primarily in the state of florida 
there can be no assurance that such provision and liability will not require material adjustment in future periods 
interest expense  net interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in primarily due to the payoff of various notes receivable 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this was primarily due to imputed interest on the civil settlement of approximately  and an increase in revolver borrowings resulting from the  civil and criminal settlements paid in the first quarter of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  primarily related to the impact of capital additions  improvements and acquisitions 
new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no

it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair market value 
sfas no 
will be effective for us during the first quarter of we do not expect there to be a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of adopting sfas no 
compared to results of operations net loss was  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of  for the year ended december  net loss for included special pre tax charges of approximately  related to the settlements of  and investigation costs related to  the allocation investigations as discussed below  as well as pre tax charges totaling approximately  for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items as discussed below 
net loss for included pre tax charges totaling approximately  for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items as discussed below 
in addition  net loss for included a  extraordinary charge  net of income taxes  related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of certain debt instruments  as well as certain bond refundings  and a cumulative effect adjustment of  net of income taxes  related to the adoption of sop as defined below 
on february   we entered into a series of separate agreements with the us department of justice and the office of inspector general the oig of the department of health and human services 
these agreements settled the federal government s investigations of the company relating to our allocation to the medicare program of certain nursing labor costs in our skilled nursing facilities from to the allocation investigations see part i  item legal proceedings 
in anticipation of such settlements  we recorded special pre tax charges of approximately   net of income taxes  or per share diluted during the year ended december   which included provisions totaling  representing the net present value of the separate civil and criminal settlements  impairment losses of  on nursing facilities that pled guilty to submitting erroneous cost reports to the medicare program in conjunction with the criminal settlement   for certain prior year cost report related items affected by the settlements   of debt issuance and refinancing costs related to various bank debt modifications as a result of the settlements  and  for other investigation and settlement related costs 
if  prior to january   the settlement obligations and related items had been finalized and recorded  our bank debt had been refinanced and we had closed or sold the facilities that were impacted by the criminal settlement  our results of operations  on an unaudited pro forma basis  would have been reduced by approximately  or 
per share diluted  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax charges totaling approximately  related to restructuring of agreements on certain leased facilities  severance and other workforce reduction expenses  asset impairments and other unusual items 
we negotiated the terminations of lease agreements on nursing facilities  beds  which resulted in a pre tax charge of  we disposed of of these nursing facilities during and expect to dispose of the remainder during during  we reversed  of the original charge for changes in our initial accounting estimates 
in addition  we accrued  during the fourth quarter of primarily related to severance agreements associated with three executives 
substantially all of the  was paid during the first quarter of in preparing for the january  implementation of the new medicare prospective payment system pps  as well as responding to other legislative and regulatory changes  we reorganized our inpatient rehabilitative operations  analyzed our businesses for impairment issues and implemented new care delivery and tracking software 
these initiatives  among others  resulted in a fourth quarter pre tax charge of approximately  including  for workforce reductions   for asset impairments and  for various other items 
during the fourth quarter of  we reorganized all employed therapy associates into a newly formed subsidiary  beverly rehabilitation  inc bev rehab  which is part of beverly care alliance  in order to create a more consolidated  strategic approach to managing our inpatient rehabilitation business under pps 
we accrued  related to the termination of therapy associates in conjunction with this reorganization 
during  therapy associates were paid  and left the company 
we reversed the remaining  during for changes in our initial accounting estimates 
in addition  our home care and outpatient therapy units underwent the consolidation and relocation of certain services  including billing and collections  which resulted in a workforce reduction charge of  associated with the termination of associates 
of these associates  associates were paid  and left the company by december  during  home care and outpatient therapy associates were paid  and left the company 
we reversed the remaining  during for changes in our initial accounting estimates 
the significant regulatory changes under pps and other provisions of the act were an indicator to management that the carrying values of certain of our nursing facilities may not be fully recoverable 
in addition  there were certain assets that had operating losses  and anticipated future operating losses  which led management to believe that these assets were impaired 
accordingly  management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by each facility and reduced the carrying value to its estimate of fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of  in management calculated the fair values of the impaired facilities by using the present value of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  or its best estimate of what that facility  or similar facilities in that state  would sell for in the open market 
management believes it has the knowledge to make such estimates of open market sales prices based on the volume of facilities we have purchased and sold in previous years 
also during the fourth quarter of  management identified nine nursing facilities with an aggregate carrying value of approximately  which needed to be replaced in order to increase operating efficiencies  attract additional census or upgrade the nursing home environment 
management committed to a plan to construct new facilities to replace these buildings and reduced the carrying values of these facilities to their estimated salvage values 
these assets were included in the total assets of beverly healthcare 
in addition  management committed to a plan to dispose of home care centers and nine outpatient therapy clinics which had and expected future period operating losses 
these businesses had an aggregate carrying value of approximately  and were written down to their fair value less costs to sell 
these assets generated pre tax losses of approximately  during the year ended december  substantially all of these assets were purchased during we disposed of a majority of these assets during these assets were included in the total assets of beverly care alliance 
we incurred a fourth quarter pre tax charge of  related to these replacements  closings and planned disposals 
in addition to the workforce reduction and impairment charges  we recorded a fourth quarter impairment charge for other long lived assets of  primarily related to the write off of software and software development costs 
in conjunction with the implementation of business process changes  and the need for enhanced data gathering and reporting required to operate effectively under pps  we installed new clinical software in each of our nursing facilities during late  which made obsolete the previously employed software 
in addition  certain of our other ongoing software development projects were abandoned or written down due to obsolescence  feasibility or cost recovery issues 
statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up and organization costs 
sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
prior to  we capitalized start up costs in connection with the opening of new facilities and businesses 
we adopted the provisions of sop in our financial statements for the year ended december  the effect of adopting sop was to decrease our pre tax loss from continuing operations in by approximately  and to record a charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change  as of january   of  net of income taxes  or per share  to expense costs that had previously been capitalized 
income taxes we had an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december   compared to an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the annual effective tax rate in was different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
the annual effective tax rate in was different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the sale of american transitional hospitals  inc ath  which operated as beverly specialty hospitals  the benefit of certain tax credits and the pre tax charge of  as discussed above which reduced our pre tax income to a level where permanent tax differences and state income taxes had more significant impact on the effective tax rate 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of  for income tax purposes which expire in years through and general business tax credit carryforwards of  for income tax purposes which expire in years through for financial reporting purposes  the federal net operating loss carryforwards and the general business tax credit carryforwards have been utilized to offset existing net taxable temporary differences reversing during the carryforward periods 
our net deferred tax assets at december  will be realized through the reversal of temporary taxable differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies  as needed 
accordingly  we did not believe that a deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at december  net operating revenues we reported net operating revenues of  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in approximately and of our total net operating revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services provided by beverly healthcare 
the decrease in net operating revenues of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  consists of the following a decrease of  due to dispositions  a decrease of  due to facilities which the company operated during each of the years ended december  and same facility operations  partially offset by an increase of  due to acquisitions 
net operating revenues decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to dispositions that occurred during the years ended december  and see compared to results of operations for discussion of dispositions 
during  we sold or terminated the leases on nursing facilities  beds and certain other assets 
we recognized net pre tax gains  which were included in net operating revenues during the year ended december   of approximately  as a result of these dispositions 
the operations of the disposed facilities and other assets were immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  we completed the sale of our ath subsidiary which operated transitional hospitals beds in eight states serving the needs of patients requiring intense therapy regimens  but not necessarily the breadth of services provided within traditional acute care hospitals 
we recognized a pre tax gain  which was included in net operating revenues during the year ended december   of approximately  as a result of this disposition 
during the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax charge to reduce the sales price of this disposition by approximately  which was included in net operating revenues 
the operations of ath were immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the decrease in net operating revenues of  from same facility operations related primarily to the following  decrease in ancillary revenues and  decrease in medicare rates  both primarily due to the impact of pps and other provisions of the act   decrease due to a shift in our patient mix   decrease due to a decline in same facility occupancy to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in  partially offset by an increase of  due primarily to increases in medicaid and private rates 
our medicare  private and medicaid census for same facility operations was  and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to  and  respectively  for the same period in net operating revenues increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to acquisitions which occurred during the years ended december  and see compared to results of operations for discussion of acquisitions 
during  we purchased outpatient therapy clinics  home care centers  eight nursing facilities beds  one assisted living center units  two previously leased nursing facilities beds and certain other assets 
the acquisitions of these facilities and other assets were accounted for as purchases 
the operations of these acquired facilities and other assets were immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
operating and administrative expenses we reported operating and administrative expenses of  during the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease of approximately  consists of the following a decrease of  from same facility operations  a decrease of  due to dispositions  partially offset by an increase of  due to acquisitions 
operating and administrative expenses decreased  from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in this decrease was due primarily to a shift in our patient mix  as well as a decline in same facility occupancy  and consists of the following  due to a decrease in wages and related expenses   decrease in our provision for insurance and related items primarily due to a loss portfolio transfer transaction that significantly increased insurance costs during the fourth quarter of   due to a decrease in contracted therapy expenses  and  due primarily to decreases in purchased ancillary products  nursing supplies and other variable costs 
although our wages and related expenses decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  our weighted average wage rate and use of contract nursing personnel increased 
these increases emphasize the difficulties many of our nursing facilities are having attracting nursing aides  assistants and other personnel 
interest expense  net interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in primarily due to the sale of investment securities in conjunction with the loss portfolio transfer transaction 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in primarily due to an increase in net borrowings under the revolver letter of credit facility  imputed interest on the civil settlement of approximately  and the write off of deferred financing costs in conjunction with certain bond refundings 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  primarily related to the impact of capital additions  improvements and acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and approximately  of unused commitments under our revolver letter of credit facility 
our revolver letter of credit facility matures on december  as a result   of revolver borrowings have been classified as current liabilities at december   which resulted in negative working capital of approximately  we expect to renegotiate  extend or refinance the agreement covering the revolver letter of credit facility prior to december  however  no assurances can be made that we will be able to do so at commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately  our operating cash flows were negatively impacted in by  of criminal and civil settlement payments made in the first quarter  as well as  which was withheld from our medicare periodic interim payments throughout as a result of the civil settlement 
exclusive of these items  our operating cash flows would have been approximately  this amount is down approximately  from our reported operating cash flows for the year ended december  of approximately  the primary reasons for this decline include the deconsolidation of all beverly funding corporation balances  which positively impacted the operating cash flows  net income tax refunds which benefited the operating cash flows  as well as an increase in patient revenues in over which led to an increase in patient accounts receivable 
net cash used for investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities were approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended december  we received net cash proceeds of approximately  from the dispositions of facilities and other assets and approximately  from collections on notes receivable 
these net cash proceeds  along with  of net borrowings under our revolver letter of credit facility and cash from operations  were used to fund capital expenditures totaling approximately  to repay approximately  of long term debt  and to repurchase shares of common stock for approximately at december   we leased nursing facilities  one assisted living center and our corporate headquarters under an off balance sheet financing arrangement subject to operating leases with the creditor 
we have the option to purchase the facilities at the end of the initial lease terms at fair market value 
the financing arrangement was entered into for the construction of these facilities and had an original commitment of  in april  the agreement covering this financing arrangement was amended whereby availability under the original commitment was reduced to  which equaled the total construction advances made as of such date 
we have  of medium term notes due march  which is off balance sheet financing for the company 
the medium term notes are collateralized by patient accounts receivable  which are sold by beverly health and rehabilitation services  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  to beverly funding corporation bfc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
in  such debt was refinanced and we were required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  to deconsolidate bfc 
at december   bfc had total assets of approximately  which cannot be used to satisfy claims of the company or any of our subsidiaries 
excluding revolver borrowings  our debts due within one year amount to  we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our banking arrangements will be adequate to repay these debts  to make normal recurring capital additions and improvements of approximately  to make selective acquisitions  including the purchase of previously leased facilities  to construct new facilities  and to meet working capital requirements for the twelve months ending december  if cash flows from operations or availability under our existing banking arrangements  including the revolver letter of credit facility  fall below expectations  we may be required to delay capital expenditures  dispose of certain assets  issue additional debt securities  or consider other alternatives to improve liquidity
