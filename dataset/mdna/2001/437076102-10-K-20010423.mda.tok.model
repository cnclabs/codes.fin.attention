diluted earnings per share were for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from store operations provides the company with a significant source of liquidity 
additionally  a portion of the company s inventory is financed under vendor credit terms 
the company currently plans to open approximately new stores and relocate existing stores during fiscal it is anticipated that approximately of these locations will be owned  and the remainder will be leased 
the company has two operating lease agreements totaling million for the purpose of financing construction costs of certain new stores 
under the operating lease agreements  the lessor purchases the properties  pays for the construction costs and subsequently leases the facilities to the company 
the leases provide for substantial residual value guarantees and include purchase options at original cost on each property 
the company financed a portion of its new stores opened from fiscal through fiscal  as well as office buildings in fiscal and  under the operating lease agreements 
the cost of new stores to be constructed and owned by the company varies widely  principally due to land costs  and is currently estimated to average approximately million per location

in addition  each new store will require approximately million to finance inventories  net of vendor financing 
during fiscal  the company issued million of senior notes senior notes 
the senior notes are due on september  and pay interest semi annually 
the senior notes may be redeemed by the company at any time  in whole or in part  at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date

the credit facility  which expires in september  contains various restrictive covenants  none of which is expected to impact the company s liquidity or capital resources 
as of january   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that its current cash position  internally generated funds  funds available from its billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternate sources of financing should enable the company to complete its capital expenditure programs  including store openings and renovations  through the next several fiscal years
