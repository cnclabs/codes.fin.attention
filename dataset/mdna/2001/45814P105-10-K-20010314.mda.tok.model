they represent the second largest earning asset component after loans 
average securities increased  or  during as the corporation pursued various investment alternatives to better employ capital and enhance revenues while maintaining conservative interest rate and credit risk exposure 
the portfolio shifted toward investments in mortgage backed securities  as these generally yield basis points more than comparable us treasury securities 
inherent in mortgage backed securities is prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
prepayment rates generally can be expected to increase during periods of lower interest rates as some of the underlying mortgages are refinanced at lower rates

board oversight of the lending function resides in the credit risk committee 
this committee  which meets monthly  includes members of integra bank s executive management as well as outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans  and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending  and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  the credit risk functions are monitored by bank credit review personnel  regulatory agencies  and independent accountants  for compliance as well as loan quality 
loans  net of unearned income at december  totaled  compared to  at year end  reflecting a decrease of  or 
during the second quarter of  the corporation securitized approximately  of its residential real estate loans and retained the resulting mortgage backed securities in its investment portfolio 
the purchase of four branches during the fourth quarter added approximately  in loans  consisting of  of commercial loans   of consumer loans and  of real estate loans

management mitigates this risk through portfolio diversification as well as geographic diversification 
the corporation concentrates its lending activity in the geographic market areas that it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and southwestern ohio 
the loan portfolio is diversified by type of loan and industry 
the loan portfolio s mix at december  consisted of real estate loans  commercial loans and consumer loans at

defaulted municipal securities are those which have defaulted on interest payments 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans where the terms have been changed to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
past due loans are loans that are continuing to accrue interest but are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
management is not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which management reasonably believes will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which management has serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms

on a quarterly basis  the corporation performs an evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation includes an analysis of past due loans  loans criticized during regulatory examinations  internally classified loans  delinquency trends  and other relevant factors 
the results of these evaluations are used by the corporation to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
credit management the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations at levels deemed necessary to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb estimated losses based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned as well as any other pertinent factors 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriate reserve level consists of several key elements 
a periodic review of selected commercial loans based on loan size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or inherent losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with management assigned accountability for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented with periodic reviews by the credit review function and regulatory agencies 
these reviews provide information which assists in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is determined based on the fair value of the investment measured using either the present value of expected cash flows based on the initial effective interest rate on the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
historical loss ratios are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific allowance allocations 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios based on the average net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the corporation s geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions  and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is determined based on management s assessment of economic conditions and specific economic factors in the individual markets in which the corporation operates 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating the allowance for pools of loans 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  a decrease of  from the  provided in during the fourth quarter of  management centralized the process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
as part of this process  and also in response to unfavorable trends in delinquencies and non performing assets  the corporation performed an extensive credit risk assessment of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the results of this assessment revealed the need to increase the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million in the fourth quarter of at the end of  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was as compared to as of year end during  the corporation s ratio of net charge offs to average loans was basis points compared to basis points in the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans at december was in and in credit management continued summary of loan loss experience analysis of the allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses  january      allowance associated with purchase acquisitions   loans charged off commercial    real estate mortgage   consumer      direct lease financing total      recoveries on charged off loans commercial real estate mortgage consumer  direct lease financing total     net charge offs      provision for loan losses      allowance for loan losses  december      total loans at year end      average loans      as a percent of year end loans net charge offs provision for loan losses year end allowance balance as a percent of average loans net charge offs provision for loan losses year end allowance balance allowance for loan losses as a percent of underperforming loans total underperforming loans      allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december allowance applicable to percent of loans to total gross loans loan type commercial      real estate mortgage      leases   consumer      allocated      unallocated      total      deposits the asset liability committee manages deposits to achieve a balance between deposit growth and the cost of funds 
average deposits increased  or  during  compared to a decrease of  or  during deposits of approximately  were assumed with the purchase of four branches from amsouth during the fourth quarter of this acquisition resulted in increased average deposits in of approximately  during  customer preferences continued to shift to money market and interest bearing demand accounts due in part to the interest rate environment and as a result of the corporation offering competitive pricing on these products

total short term borrowings totaled  at december   an increase of  over year end federal funds purchased  overnight borrowings from other financial institutions  totaled  at december  compared to  at year end securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized transactions acquired in national markets as well as from the corporation s commercial customers as a part of a cash management service 
repurchase agreements generally provide the corporation with a lower interest cost than similar sources of funds and were  at december  compared to  one year prior 
this increase was used primarily to fund the purchase of securities  as discussed earlier

included in this amount was  shares repurchased in connection with the acquisition of webster bancorp  inc the average equity to average asset ratio was and for and  respectively 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the corporation and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december   the corporation and its banking subsidiary exceeded the regulatory minimums and the banking subsidiary met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
bank liquidity is thus normally considered in terms of the nature of mix of the banking institution s sources and uses of funds 
for the corporation  the primary sources of short term liquidity have been federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits in banks  and us government and agency securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term liquidity is provided by maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and needs to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the corporation s asset liability management program 
when these sources are not adequate  the corporation may use federal funds purchased  brokered deposits  and its lines with federal home loan banks as alternative sources of liquidity 
additionally  the corporation s underwriting standards for its mortgage loan portfolio comply with standards established by government housing agencies  as a result  a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold were  and  interest bearing deposits in banks were and  and us government and agency securities available for sale were  and  these sources and other liquid assets also satisfy long term liquidity needs 
long term liquidity is managed in the same way  only with longer maturities  to provide for future needs while maintaining interest margins 
in  the corporation increased its use of federal home loan bank lines to reduce dependence on short term federal funds borrowings 
at december   the corporation had  available from unused federal funds purchased agreements and in excess of  of available borrowing capacity from federal home loan bank lines 
in addition  the corporation has an unsecured line of credit available which permits it to borrow up to  at variable rates adjusted with changes in libor through june  at december    remained available for future use 
the corporation s trust securities affiliate issued  in trust preferred securities in  primarily  to fund the purchase of a subsidiary bank and a branch 
the corporation has guaranteed the debt of subsidiaries totaling  at december   the corporation was not in compliance with a financial covenant requiring that the corporation maintain  on a consolidated basis  a leverage ratio in excess of 
the corporation received a waiver  dated march  the ability of the corporation to pay cash dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
banking regulations impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends to the corporation 
the amount of dividends that could be paid is further restricted by management to maintain prudent capital levels 
interest rate sensitivity the corporation s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the corporation 
other types of market risk do not arise in the normal course of the corporation s business activities 
interest rate risk is the potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes 
this economic loss can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the corporation s net income is dependent  to a significant degree  on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  if interest earning assets reprice or mature more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  a decrease in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
changes in market rates can cause fluctuations in the current fair market values of financial instruments 
in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the corporation monitors interest rate risk through analysis of standard gap reports and interest rate shock simulation reports on the effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income and on the economic value of equity the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities 
the following tables set forth  at december   an analysis of the corporation s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in economic value of equity eve and net interest income nii following parallel shifts in the yield curve 
interest rate sensitivity continued certain assumptions were employed in preparing data in the following tables 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
decrease in eve decrease in nii changes in estimated estimated interest rates eve amount amount percent nii amount amount percent basis points even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that the corporation s assets and liabilities would perform as set forth 
in addition  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to the eve or nii than indicated above 
financial instruments used to manage interest rate risk include on balance sheet investment securities and off balance sheet interest rate derivatives  which include interest rate caps and exchange traded option contracts 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk at december  are discussed more thoroughly in notes and of the consolidated financial statements

net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the following schedule 
in addition to this schedule  at the end of management s discussion and analysis is a three year balance sheet analysis on an average basis and an analysis of net interest income
