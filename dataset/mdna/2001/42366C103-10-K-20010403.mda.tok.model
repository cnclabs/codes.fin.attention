statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information under part i  special notes regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of forward looking information 
background we are actively engaged in various clinical efforts and market development strategies in the united states  european union  canada  australia and south africa 
disease categories under active development include me cfs  hepatitis and hiv 
we maintain offices and clinical operations in both the united states and the european union 
we also have ownership interests in red laboratories a european based diagnostic company and ribotech ltd 
a south african manufacturing entity  which produces our raw drug materials 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred substantial operating losses 
prior to completing an initial public offering ipo in november  we financed operations primarily through the private placement of equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  interest income and revenues from licensing and royalty agreements 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of hemispherx biopharma  inc and its four wholly owned subsidiaries  biopro corp  bioaegean corp  core biotech corp 
and hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa the us subsidiaries were incorporated in september for the purpose of developing technology for ultimate sale into certain non pharmaceutical specialty consumer markets 
the european subsidiary was formed for the purpose of serving our needs with respect to pursuing clinical trials and regulatory approval in the european union 
the us subsidiaries are inactive at this time 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
in  we initiated a phase iii clinical study of using ampligen to treat patients affected by me cfs at various medical centers in the united states 
me cfs patients that are not eligible for the phase iii clinical study may seek treatment under a me cfs cost recovery treatment program that has been authorized by the fda 
under the cost recovery program  enrolled patients pay for the cost of ampligen administered  which totals  for a week treatment program 
patients are also treated in belgium and austria under similar cost recovery programs 
in march  we discovered that we should have recorded a non cash charge for stock compensation expense in our financial statements 
this change is related to the extension of the expiration date of certain rule warrants in february the  adjustment does not affect our cash or our shareholder net worth  but it does affect the net loss and earnings per share 
all references to the financial statements in this form k  have been adjusted to reflect this change 
we expect to continue our research and clinical efforts for the next several years with some benefit of certain revenues from our cost recovery treatment programs 
these cost recovery treatment sales were approximately  in fiscal year we may continue to incur losses over the next several years due to clinical and operating costs which may be partially offset by cost recovery treatment revenues and potential licensing fees 
such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of significant expenses incurred and receipt of licensing fees and or revenues 
acquisition of full or conditional marketing approval in any major market would significantly affect our cash flow 
there are no assurances that such approvals will ever happen in any major pharmaceutical market 
results of operations the company is restating its consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and for the first quarter of the restated financial statements now reflect a non cash charge for the extension of the lives of certain section warrants on february   as described in note to the financial statements

the company expects the european operations to expand significantly in the company s european operations received a  research grant in from a france based pharmaceutical company 
research and development costs in  research and development costs increased  primarily due to a major increase in patients entering the amp me cfs clinical trial initiated by us in and our efforts in europe to increase the expanded me cfs access program in european countries other than belgium 
by year end we had engaged the services of eleven clinical investigators located throughout the united states to enroll eligible me cfs patients in the amp program 
as of december  some patients were involved in the clinical study 
cost incurred in producing ampligen and other drugs for clinical studies were  in compared to  in the production costs reflect the build up of drug supplies needed to support clinical trials and other research and development efforts expected in and at present  we charge all raw material and related production costs to research and development expense as incurred 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were down  in compared to lower stock compensation expense accounted for  of this decrease 
this expense was  in versus  in stock compensation expense is a non cash expense that reflects the fair value of our common stock and warrants granted to non employees of our company for services or benefits provided 
the decrease in reflects fewer warrants granted to consultants and other service providers 
legal and related expenses in were lower by  compared to  primarily due to lower costs from litigation associated with the asensio company lawsuit  and other legal matters 
legal expenses associated with the company s defense of the asensio countersuit are mostly paid by our company s liability insurance carrier 
expenses associated with stock transactions  the filing of registration statements and financing costs were lower by  the cost of evaluating the feasibility of the proposed spin off of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  core biotech corp  was  in which did not occur in we have not decided whether to spin off core biotech corp

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were approximately  cash used for operating activities in was approximately 
cash used for investing and financing activities totaled  and consists of expenditures of  for capital expenditures  for patent acquisition cost   investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   in other investments and  to acquire  shares of our company stock which will be used to acquire interest in companies and biotechnologies that may benefit our purposes 
in addition  purchases of short term investments exceeded maturities of these investments by  cash proceeds from financing activities in were approximately   was received from the collection of stock subscriptions and  was generated from the exercise of warrants to acquire  shares of our stock 
our operating cash burn rate for the last six months of fiscal year was approximately  per month or  on an annualized basis 
all clinical trial drug products produced in were fully expensed and some costs are expected to be recovered under the expanded access  cost recovery programs authorized by fda and regulatory bodies in other countries 
as the clinical testing efforts in the united states moderates and the european market development activity increases cost recovery revenues  the operating cash burn rate should decline somewhat in also  certain of the operating  as well as the non operating cash outlays are of a one time nature and are expected to decline 
we also expect warrant holders to continue exercising the class a redeemable warrants and private warrants from time to time depending on the trading price of our common stock 
as of december   we had  class a redeemable warrants outstanding 
these warrants are exercisable at per share 
in addition  there are  class a redeemable warrants outstanding at an exercise price of per share 
private warrants outstanding total  with a weighted average exercise price of 
based on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december  and projected operating cash needs  we expect to have sufficient cash to fund operations through at least the second quarter of because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved
