the company s sales  by reportable segment  were as follows in thousands year ended august  retail stores    catalog ecommerce    osg    educational    international    other    retail store sales decreased primarily due to reduced consumer traffic during fiscal  combined with strong prior year sales of handheld electronic planning devices and related accessories 
the company attributes the decline in consumer traffic to deteriorating general economic conditions in the united states that began in late  cannibalization of existing store sales by newly opened stores  and slowing demand for various handheld electronic planning devices and accessories 
these factors combined to produce a percent decrease in comparable store sales  which was partially offset by the addition of new stores during fiscal the company was operating stores at august  catalog ecommerce sales declined primarily due to decreased call volume in the company s catalog operations

the company attributes the decline in corporate seminars to economic conditions that appear to have adversely affected corporate training spending during fiscal educational sales  which include the sales of premier  increased primarily due to an increase in the number of schools that use premier s products and services 
premier  which provides productivity and leadership solutions to students  teachers  and others in the education market  records the majority of its sales during the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
increased international sales in mexico and europe were partially offset by decreases in australia  canada  new zealand  and at various licensee operations

other sales decreased primarily due to the shift of personal coaching services to a joint venture  decreased wholesale sales  and decreased public seminar sales 
as a result of the formation of the joint venture  the company no longer recognizes the sales of the personal coaching division  but only recognizes its share of net income from the joint venture

during fiscal  the company reduced certain catalog and promotional expenses to improve the overall profitability of its catalog ecommerce operation 
due to declining sales volumes experienced during fiscal  the company also implemented numerous cost saving initiatives in various operating areas of the company 
these initiatives were generally successful and the company realized significant sg a expense savings  especially in its third and fourth fiscal quarters

the company may  at its option  pay accrued dividends with cash or additional shares of preferred stock until july  subsequent to that date  preferred stock dividends must be paid in cash 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales retail store sales increased due to a percent increase in comparable store sales and the opening of new stores during fiscal at august   the company was operating stores compared to stores at august  comparable store sales growth during fiscal was primarily fueled by increased sales of handheld electronic planning and organizational devices  as well as sales of related accessories

osg sales increased primarily due to improved sales effectiveness and leadership training sales

other sales  which consist primarily of personal coaching  commercial printing and tabbing operations  wholesale  government  and public seminar sales  decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the commercial printing division of publishers press  which was effective february  additionally  personal coaching sales declined due to reduced demand for coaching services from one of its major customers 
government sales continued to be adversely affected by uncertainties surrounding the potential closure of gsa depots and service centers 
public seminar sales also decreased due to reduced enrollment in the company s public seminar programs 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased wholesale sales primarily resulting from increased demand from existing sales and marketing agreements  the successful introduction of new products  and the addition of new marketing and distribution agreements

the cost to provide these benefits under the restructuring plan was estimated to be million and covered a reduction of approximately employees across all areas of the business 
at august   the remaining accrued severance costs were reviewed and reduced based upon estimates of remaining liability for the severance program 
the adjustment was primarily due to favorable economic conditions that reduced the average time necessary for terminated employees to find new employment

also included in the restructuring provision was a charge to exit the majority of the company s leased office space in provo  utah 
these facilities contained sales  marketing  and other functions primarily aligned with training and education sales 
before exiting the lease  sales and other sales support functions located in provo were moved to regional offices located in new york  chicago  los angeles  san francisco  columbus  dallas  atlanta  and washington  dc the company anticipated the costs to exit the facilities and sublease the space to be approximately million

the remaining accrual is expected to be sufficient to complete the building exit plan 
interest expense interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower long term debt balances during fiscal long term debt decreased due to the retirement of million of notes payable during october the notes payable were retired using existing cash balances and the company s expanded lines of credit

    income loss available to common shareholders    diluted income loss per share 


the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklin planners on a calendar year basis 
osg sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled during holiday and vacation periods 
educational sales are primarily affected by the timing of premier s sales  which occur nearly exclusively in the company s fourth fiscal quarter

however  based upon operating results recorded during the first two months of the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects to not be in compliance with the terms of the line of credit agreements at the end of the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the long term credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation that determines the available borrowing amount 
at august   the borrowing base calculation did not limit the amount available to the company
