item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts general the company s primary long term objective is to produce high risk adjusted dividends for shareholders supported by operating earnings determined under generally accepted accounting principals gaap before realized gains and hedging adjustments 
strong gaap operating earnings are primarily maintained by consistent credit performance on the company s investments and diversification and consistency of the company s liability structures 
in order to achieve these objectives the company is focused on increasing its size and capital base because this should lead to both increased diversification of credit exposures and improved diversification of financing sources and structures 
where increased size can be achieved with limited dilution to common shareholders the company will pursue it aggressively 
in the company focused on maintaining liquidity  increasing capital base and reducing risk where feasible 
during the year the company s cash and liquid assets portfolio increased by and its capital base increased by  both due primarily to the merger with core cap inc an increase in hedging activity brought the company s equity duration down from years at december  to years at december  equity duration is the sensitivity of an assets value to changes in interest rates 
this combination of accomplishments permitted the company to increase gaap earnings despite rising short term interest rates 
after paying out a per share dividend for eight consecutive quarters the rising earnings level was able to support an increased dividend payout declared in the fourth quarter of per share 
on may  the company completed the acquisition of core cap  inc the merger was a stock for stock acquisition where the company issued  shares of its common stock and  shares of its series b preferred stock 
this transaction increased the total equity capital of the company by  immediately before the transaction core cap owned a portfolio of investment grade real estate related securities 
during the remainder of the company sold off most of these assets and redeployed the proceeds into high yielding commercial real estate loans and preferred equity interests in partnerships that own commercial office properties 
the most significant aspect of the transaction was the issuance of the series b perpetual  convertible preferred stock 
the conversion price is per share of ahr common stock 
this represents permanent fixed rate capital at terms well below what would otherwise be available in the capital markets 
while the liquidation preference of the stock is  the low coupon and high conversion price reduces the market value to of that amount  or  this represents a discount of  which accrues to the benefit of the anthracite common shareholders 
the market value of the assets purchased was determined based on market bids and validated by significant sales 
therefore  the net asset value of the core cap portfolio exceeded the value of the consideration paid by the company 
market conditions relevant to company performance commercial real estate credit the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide for transactions to be the most relevant measure of market conditions applicable to its below investment grade cmbs holdings 
the broader measure of all transactions tracked in the conduit guide since also provides relevant comparable information 
the delinquency statistics are shown in the table below lehman brothers conduit guide for lehman brothers conduit guide for all transactions transactions date number of collateral number of collateral securitizations balance delinquent securitizations balance delinquent morgan stanley dean witter msdw also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies using a slightly smaller universe 
their index tracks all cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral that have been seasoned for at least one year 
this will generally adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral

real estate against the backdrop of a slowing us economy  the majority of markets remain near equilibrium 
during  demand was strong enough to absorb new supply and cause rent increases 
demand is expected to slow from the levels seen in but construction is also projected to slow for most  but not all  property types 
most market are expected to remain in balance while selected property types and markets may experience slower demand and reduced rent growth 
real estate capital markets commercial real estate debt securities continued to exhibit modest spread tightening 
this was due in part to low cmbs defaults relative to corporate bond defaults and growing use of cmbs in collateralized bond obligations 
low default experience for cmbs has also led rating agencies to reduce levels of subordination required to support a designated credit rating 
these lower credit support requirements have been applied to cmbs transactions issued in and rating agencies have cited several factors to explain the reduction in credit support levels 
cmbs collateral performance has been strong for the past seven years as measured by the msdw index  furthermore the american council of life insurers acli data also shows historically low levels of commercial mortgage defaults 
rating agencies  most recently fitch  have also noted the low level of defaults and delinquencies among cmbs relative to the rising levels of corporate bond defaults 
when default rates are compared across bonds of the same rating  the conclusion is that ratings in prior years were conservative relative to the risk 
cmbs credit spreads remain at historically wide levels despite continued strength in the commercial real estate credit markets 
corporate high yield spreads widened considerably at the end of the chart below compares the credit spreads for high yield cmbs to high yield corporate bonds

short term rates increased  as one month libor increased by basis points from to 
throughout the first three quarters of the federal reserve board s concern about inflation kept upward pressure on short term rates 
evidence of a slowing economy began to surface during the fourth quarter 
at the beginning of the fed began a dramatic reversal of short term policy by reducing rates in basis points increments 
by the end of march the fed had reduced short term rates by basis points 
this caused one month libor to drop to by march  see below the section titled  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a detailed discussion of how interest rates and spreads affect the company 
effect of market conditions on company performance commercial mortgage backed securities the company s below investment grade cmbs represent approximately  of par collateralized by underlying pools of first lien commercial mortgages 
the cmbs owned by the company include  loans with an aggregate principal balance of over billion as of december  the company is in a first loss position with respect to these loans 
the company manages its credit risk through conservative underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process as early as possible 
all of these processes are based on the extensive intranet based analytic systems developed by blackrock 
in underwriting loans  the company performs site inspections and or desktop reviews of all loans in the pools 
this process includes detailed analysis of regional economic factors  industry outlooks  project viability and documentation 
unacceptable risks are removed from the pool 
an assumption of expected losses is developed and the securities are priced accordingly 
earnings are reported net of the assumption that credit losses will occur 
through december  the company had expected to incur realized losses of approximately  and has actually incurred losses of approximately  over the life of the portfolio the company expects to realize principal losses on cmbs collateral of approximately  and lost coupon cash flow of approximately  the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions

this worldwide web web based system allows the company to monitor payments  debt service coverage ratios  regional economic statistics  general real estate market trends and other relevant factors 
the company also uses the web based system to monitor delinquencies 
the company updates this information monthly allowing for more detailed analysis of loans before problems develop

one of the loans in foreclosure is the subject of litigation with the loan seller 
the matter involves a significant breach of representations and warranties made when the loan was contributed to the securitization transaction 
the company caused the loan trust to file a claim against the seller for representing that a loan secured by a limited service hotel in phoenix  az was a flagged hotel when  in fact  it was not 
the company believes strongly in the merits of the breach claim and has caused the special servicer to institute legal action against the loan seller 
the company s delinquency experience of is slightly better than the for directly comparable collateral experience shown in the lehman brothers conduit guide for transactions 
during the company also experienced early payoffs of  representing of the year end pool balance 
these loans were paid at par with no loss 
the anticipated losses attributable to these loans will be reallocated to the loans remaining in the pools 
subsequent to december   two of the delinquent loans were brought current 
additionally  three other loans with a total balance of  were paid off at par with no loss to the company 
the unrealized loss on the company s holdings of cmbs at december  was  this decline in the value of the investment portfolio represents market valuation changes and is not due to credit experience or credit expectations 
the adjusted purchase price of the company s cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures the company expects to recoup the unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the purchase analysis 
the company performs a detailed review of its loss assumptions on a quarterly basis and will adjust them when it believes that credit experience or expectations justify such an adjustment 
as of december  the company concluded that real estate credit fundamentals remain solid  and the company believes there has been no material change in the credit quality of its portfolio 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded 
this would negatively affect the market value and liquidity of the portfolio 
investment grade real estate related securities as part of the acquisition of core cap  inc  in the company inherited three securities backed by franchise loans originated by franchise mortgage acceptance corporation fmac 
the securities were the class b  c and d securities issued by the fmac t ba trust 
the respective credit ratings at the date of acquisition were aa  a and bbb 
the company sold the bbb rated class d security immediately after the acquisition 
the trust is collateralized by loans on properties to borrowers 
the quality of information provided by the servicer on underlying collateral has been poor 
in october the company sold of its position in class c and recognized a loss of information on the collateral continues to be poor and in march class b was downgraded to a and class c was downgraded to bb 
this will cause the prices of these bonds to be marked down further at march  the company s current strategy is to force the servicer to provide timely and accurate information so the bonds may be properly evaluated

recent events beginning on january  the federal reserve board reversed its policy of increasing short term interest rates 
the fed reduced rates by basis points on each of january  january and march  each rate reduction was accompanied by a continuing bias towards additional rate eases

funds from operations ffo most industry analysts  including the company  consider ffo an appropriate supplementary measure of operating performance of a reit 
in general  ffo adjusts net income for non cash charges such as depreciation  certain amortization expenses and gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property 
however  ffo does not represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the results of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the definition recommended by the national association of real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that the exclusion from ffo of gains or losses from sales of property was not intended to address gains or losses from sales of securities as it applies to the company 
accordingly  the company includes gains or losses from sales of securities in its calculation of ffo 
the company s ffo for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  which was the same as its reported gaap net income for the periods

net interest margin and net interest spread from the portfolio the company considers its portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  mortgage loan pools  commercial mortgage loans  and cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of liquid investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income from the portfolio divided by the average market value of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
net interest income from the portfolio is total interest income from the portfolio less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread from the portfolio equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income from the portfolio divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets in the portfolio 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings

tax basis income was  or per share basic and diluted for the period march  through december   compared to a net loss calculated in accordance with gaap of  or per share basic and diluted 
differences between tax basis net income and gaap net income arise for various reasons 
for example  in computing income from its subordinated cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
as there were no actual credit losses incurred in  tax basis income for subordinate cmbs is higher the gaap income 
additionally  payments made to gmac asset management  inc to terminate its management contract with core cap  inc were deducted for tax purposes 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income 
also  differences could arise in the treatment of premium and discount amortization on the company s securities available for sale

to date  the company has obtained short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s financing objectives 
under the lines of credit  term loans  and the reverse repurchase agreements  the lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to market value

the estimated fair value of these contracts was approximately  at december  at december  the company did not have us treasury future contracts 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that the company recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability  or a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative eg  through earnings or outside of earnings  through comprehensive income depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas also defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
the company adopted sfas on january  on that date  the company reclassified certain of its agency adjustable rate debt securities  with an amortized cost of  from available for sale to trading 
an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount that had been designated as hedging these debt securities was similarly reclassified

in addition  on january   the company redesignated certain other interest rate swap agreements that had been hedging available for sale debt securities as cash flow hedges of its variable rate borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements 
to the extent that these interest rate swaps effectively hedge these variable cash flows  the change in their fair value will be recorded in other comprehensive income  any change in value resulting from over hedging will be recorded in earnings 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of collateralized borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading and commercial mortgage loans  and proceeds from sales thereof 
to the extent that the company may become unable to maintain its borrowings at their current level due to changes in the financing markets for the company s assets then the company may be required to sell assets in order to achieve lower borrowings levels 
in this event  the company s level of net earnings would decline 
the company s principal strategies for mitigating this risk are to maintain portfolio leverage at levels it believes are sustainable and to diversify the sources and types of available borrowing and capital

as of december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends to a significant degree on its ability to obtain additional capital 
factors which could affect the company s access to the capital markets  or the costs of such capital  include changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and perception in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants under the company s current and future credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial conditions and business prospects 
current conditions in the capital markets for reits such as the company have made permanent financing transactions difficult and more expensive than at the time of the company s initial public offering 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively fund future growth 
except as discussed herein  management is not aware of any other trends  events  commitments or uncertainties that may have a significant effect on liquidity 
reit status the company has elected to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates or at excise tax rates on net income or capital gains not distributed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit risk is highly sensitive to dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
the majority of the company s liabilities are floating rate based on a market spread to us libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income test purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value and net interest income under various interest rates and credit spread scenarios 
net portfolio value is defined as the value of interest earning assets net of the value of interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using an assumption that interest rates  as defined by the us treasury yield curve  increase or decrease up to basis points and the assumption that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net interest income is defined as interest income earned from interest earning assets net of the interest expense incurred by the interest bearing liabilities 
it is evaluated using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the us libor curve  increase or decrease by basis points and the assumption that the yield curve of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  and actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given us treasury yield curve movements projected change change in projected change in portfolio treasury yield curve  in portfolio net market value basis points net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net market value given credit spread movements projected change in change in projected change in portfolio credit spreads  portfolio net market value basis points net market value base case projected percentage change in portfolio net interest income given libor movements projected change in projected change in portfolio change in libor  portfolio net interest income basis points net interest income base case applying the above percentages to the change in earnings available to common shareholder requires an adjustment to take into account the effect of the fixed rate coupons on the company s preferred stock 
this adjustment is the ratio of the total stock outstanding divided by common stock outstanding giving a multiplier of 
therefore  the effect of a basis point change in short rates on common earnings per share is credit risk credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the american economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
the nature of the cmbs assets owned are such that all losses experienced by a pool of mortgages will be borne by the company 
changes in the expected default rates of the underlying mortgages will significantly affect the value of the company  the income it accrues and the cash flow it receives 
an increase in default rates will reduce the book value of the company s assets and the company earnings and cash flow available to fund operations and pay dividends 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions  and careful monitoring of loan performance 
before acquiring a security that represents a pool of loans  the company will perform a rigorous analysis of the quality of substantially all of the loans proposed for that security 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles will be removed from the proposed security 
information from this review is then used to establish loss assumptions 
the company will assume that a certain portion of the loans will default and calculate an expected  or loss adjusted yield based on that assumption 
after the securities have been acquired the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or timing experience is likely to cause a reduction in the expected yield  and therefore reduce the earnings of the company and may require a significant write down of assets 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s credit sensitive portfolio  without a significant acceleration of those losses would reduce the expected yield on adjusted purchase price from to 
this would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per common share and cause a significant write down in assets at the time the loss assumption is changed 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
the company uses interest rate duration as its primary measure of interest rate risk 
this metric  expressed when considering any existing leverage  allows the company s management to approximate changes in the net market value of the company s portfolio given potential changes in the us treasury yield curve 
interest rate duration considers both assets and liabilities 
as of december   and the company s duration on equity was approximately and years  respectively 
this implies that a parallel shift of the us treasury yield curve of basis points would cause the company s net asset value to increase or decrease by approximately and  respectively 
because the company s assets  and their markets  have other  more complex sensitivities to interest rates  the company s management believes that this metric represents a good approximation of the change in portfolio net market value in response to changes in interest rates  though actual performance may vary due to changes in prepayments  credit spreads and the cost of increased market volatility 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets pay a fixed coupon and the income from such assets are relatively unaffected by interest rate changes 
the majority of the company s liabilities are borrowings under its line of credit or reverse repurchase agreements that bear interest at variable rates that reset monthly 
given this relationship between assets and liabilities  the company s interest rate sensitivity gap is highly negative 
this implies that a period of falling short term interest rates will tend to increase the company s net interest income while a period of rising short term interest rates will tend to reduce the company s net interest income 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company currently has positions in forward currency exchange contracts to hedge currency exposure in connection with its commercial mortgage loan denominated in pounds sterling 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual us dollar net cash inflows from the commercial mortgage loan will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company s current strategy is to roll these contracts from time to time to hedge the expected cash flows from the loan 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s net portfolio value or net interest income
