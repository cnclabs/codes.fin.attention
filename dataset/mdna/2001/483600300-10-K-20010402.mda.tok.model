item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of our actual results and timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors  elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings 
overview we are a leading provider of enterprise relationship management erm software solutions that deliver integrated communication and business applications built on a web architectured platform 
we were incorporated in july in california and were reincorporated in delaware in september we had no significant operations until in february  we released the first commercially available version of the kana platform 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from licensing our software and related services  and we have sold our products worldwide primarily through our direct sales force 
on august   we completed a merger with connectify pursuant to which connectify became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the merger  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of connectify capital stock and reserved  shares of common stock for issuance upon the exercise of connectify options and warrants we assumed in connection with the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on december   we completed a merger with business evolution pursuant to which business evolution became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition of business evolution   shares of our common stock were issued for all outstanding shares and warrants of business evolution 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on december   we completed a merger with netdialog pursuant to which netdialog became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the acquisition of netdialog   shares of our common stock were issued for all outstanding shares  warrants and convertible notes of netdialog 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on april   we completed a merger with silknet under which silknet became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the silknet merger  each share of silknet common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock and we assumed silknet s outstanding stock options and warrants based on the exchange ratio  issuing approximately million shares of our common stock and reserving million shares of common stock for issuance upon the exercise of silknet options and warrants we assumed in connection with the merger 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the merger  we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately billion  which we were amortizing over a period of three years 
during the quarter ended december   we performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of silknet 
as a result of our review  we recorded a billion impairment charge to reduce our goodwill 
the remaining goodwill and identifiable intangibles balance of approximately million will be amortized over the remaining useful life 
on june   we sold  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million net proceeds of approximately million in a private placement transaction 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and from professional services including implementation  consulting  hosting and maintenance 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software  acceptance has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
if the arrangement involves significant customization of the software  the fee  excluding the portion attributable to maintenance  is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
service revenue includes revenues from maintenance contracts  implementation  consulting and hosting services 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from implementation  consulting and hosting services is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue under arrangements where multiple products or services are sold together is allocated to each element based on their relative fair values 
our cost of license revenue includes royalties due to third parties for technology integrated into some of our products  the cost of product documentation  the cost of the media used to deliver our products and shipping costs 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel related expenses  subcontracted consultants  travel costs  equipment costs and overhead associated with delivering professional services to our customers 
our operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to the category  some expenditures  such as compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  facilities costs and third party professional services fees  occur in each of these categories 
we allocate the total costs for information services and facilities to each functional area that uses the information services and facilities based on its relative headcount 
these allocated costs include rent and other facility related costs  communication charges and depreciation expense for furniture and equipment 
since  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our products and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our engineering  sales  marketing  client services and administration departments 
as a result  we have incurred substantial losses since inception and  for the twelve months ended december   incurred a net loss of billion 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
we believe our future success is contingent upon providing superior customer service  increasing our customer base and developing our products 
we expect to decrease our operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had  full time employees 
we recently restructured our organization in the first quarter of with workforce reductions of approximately employees  in order to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with industry standards 
we may reduce our workforce again in the near future 
we believe that our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets like ours 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth recently  this trend may not continue  particularly in light of increasing competition in our markets  the worsening economic outlook and declining expenditures on enterprise software products 
furthermore  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in management s opinion  have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and will fluctuate  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected data for the periods presented expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross profit selected operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative comparison of the years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased license revenue 
license revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase in license revenue was due primarily to increased market acceptance of our products  expansion of our product line and increased sales generated by our expanded sales force and the acquisition of silknet 
license revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for service revenues increased by  to million for the year ended december  from million for service revenue increased primarily due to increased licensing activity described above  resulting in increased revenue from customer implementations  system integration projects  maintenance contracts and hosted service 
service revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for revenues from international sales were million and million in the years ended december  and our international revenues were derived from sales in europe  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased cost of service revenues 
cost of license revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   the increase mainly associated with increased license revenues and new third party software royalties 
as a percentage of license revenues  cost of license revenues was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  cost of license revenues includes third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation  production and delivery costs for shipments to customers 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for our customer support  implementation and training services organization and allocation of facility costs and system costs incurred in providing customer support 
cost of service revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the growth in cost of service revenues was attributable to an increase in personnel dedicated to support our growing number of customers and related recruiting  travel  related facility and system costs and third party consulting expenses 
additional increases are attributable to our acquisition of silknet and the inclusion of its cost of service revenues from the effective date of the merger 
as a percentage of service revenues  cost of service revenues was in and in we anticipate that cost of service revenue will be relatively stable in absolute dollars in future periods 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials 
sales and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of sales and marketing personnel from internal growth and the silknet acquisition  the expansion of our international sales offices  an increase in sales commissions associated with increased revenues and higher marketing costs due to expanded advertising and promotional activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percent of total revenues was due primarily to the increase in total revenues over the prior period 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will be relatively stable in absolute dollars  but will vary as a percentage of total revenues from period to period 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors and enhancement of existing products and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of personnel  due to internal growth and the silknet acquisition  product development and related benefits  and consulting expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expense as a percent of total revenues was due primarily to the increase in total revenues over the prior period 
we expect to continue to make investments in research and development  but anticipate that research and development expenses will be relatively stable in absolute dollars  but will vary as a percentage of total revenues from period to period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased personnel from internal growth and the silknet acquisition  increase in allowance for doubtful accounts  increase in legal and other professional service provider fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues was due primarily to the proportionately greater increase in total revenues than general and administrative expenses over the prior period 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable in absolute dollars 
however  we expect that these expenses will vary as a percentage of total revenues from period to period 
amortization of stock based compensation in connection with the granting of stock options to our employees  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling approximately million through december  this amount represents the total difference between the exercise prices of stock options and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in fasb interpretation no 
on september   we issued to accenture  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement in connection with our global strategic alliance 
the shares of the common stock issued were fully vested  and we have recorded a charge of approximately million to be amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
the portion of the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock is fully vested with the remainder becoming vested upon the achievement of certain performance goals 
the vested warrants were valued using the black scholes model resulting in a charge of million to be amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
we will incur a charge to stock based compensation for the unvested portion of the warrant when performance goals are achieved 
on december   accenture earned and vested in a portion of the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
this vesting of shares resulted in a stock based charge to operations of  during the quarter ended december  as of december   shares of common stock under the warrant which were unvested had a fair value of approximately million based upon the fair market value of our common stock at such date 
on february   we filed a tender offer statement on schedule to announcing our offer to exchange certain eligible options outstanding under the stock option plans for new options to purchase shares of our common stock and for restricted shares of our common stock 
the new options will be granted on or after six months and one day after the date the tendered options are accepted and cancelled 
there are options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock that could be exchanged if all the options eligible under stock option plans were tendered by the employees 
we will incur a charge to compensation expense in connection with the issuance of the restricted shares of common stock  based upon the fair market value of the common stock at the time of the exchange 
the charge to compensation expense will be amortized over the six month vesting term of the restricted stock 
had the compensation cost related to the maximum number of restricted shares issuable under the offer been determined based upon the fair market value of per share at the date of the tender offer  the total compensation charge would have approximated million 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unearned deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
the amortization of stock based compensation by operating expense is detailed as follows in thousands years ended  december cost of service   sales and marketing   research and development   general and administrative  total    amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles on april   we completed a merger with silknet 
as a result of the merger  billion was allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
this amount is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three years from the date of acquisition 
we recorded million in amortization for the year ended december  in process research and development in connection with the merger of silknet  net intangibles of million were allocated to in process research and development 
the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined by identifying the research projects for which technological feasibility has not been achieved and which have no alternative future use at the merger date  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the merger date  and calculating the net present value of the cash flows expected to result from the successful deployment of the new technology resulting from the in process research and development effort 
the stages of completion were determined by estimating the costs and time incurred to date relative to the costs and time incurred to develop the in process technology into a commercially viable technology or product  while considering the relative difficulty of completing the various tasks and obstacles necessary to attain technological feasibility 
as of the date of the acquisition  silknet had two projects in process that were complete 
the estimated net present value of cash flows was based on incremental future cash flows from revenues expected to be generated by the technologies in the process of development  taking into account the characteristics and applications of the technologies  the size and growth rate of existing and future markets and an evaluation of past and anticipated technology and product life cycles 
estimated net future cash flows included allocations of operating expenses and income taxes but excluded the expected completion costs of the in process projects  and were discounted at a rate of to arrive at a net present value 
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful deployment of in process technology projects 
this net present value was allocated to in process research and development based on the percentage of completion at the merger date 
acquisition related costs in connection with the silknet merger  we recorded million of transaction costs and merger related integration expenses 
these amounts consisted primarily of merger related advertising and announcements of million and duplicate facility costs of million 
goodwill impairment we performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of silknet 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the silknet acquisition resulting in our net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower fourth quarter of actual and projected operating results 
as a result of our review  we recorded a billion impairment charge to reduce goodwill 
the charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining estimated useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows including the discount rate were determined using our best estimates as of such date 
the remaining goodwill balance of approximately million will be amortized over its remaining useful life 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of the remaining goodwill and intangibles periodically in accordance with our policy 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in consists primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments and in  interest expense related to warrants issued to convertible debt holders offset by interest income 
other income expense  net was income of million for the year ended december  and expense of  for the year ended december  the increase in other income expense  net was primarily interest income earned on higher average cash balances and lower interest expense paid on debt 
provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december   and therefore have not recorded a provision for income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
as of december  and december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these federal and state loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income 
the federal loss carryforwards expire at various dates into the year under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
net loss our net loss was billion and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we have experienced substantial increases in our expenditures since our inception consistent with growth in our operations and personnel 
in addition  goodwill impairment  amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles and stock based compensation charges have contributed to the significant increase in net loss during we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
although our revenue has grown in recent quarters  we cannot be certain that we can sustain this growth or that we will generate sufficient revenue to attain profitability 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue total revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  license revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase in license revenue was due primarily to increased market acceptance of our products  expansion of our product line and increased sales generated by our expanded sales force 
service revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from  for service revenue increased primarily due to increased licensing activity  resulting in increased revenue from maintenance contracts  customer implementations and hosted service 
service revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to increased cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the growth in cost of service revenues was attributable primarily to an increase in personnel dedicated to support our growing number of customers and related recruiting and travel expenses as well as facility expenses and system costs 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of sales and marketing personnel  an increase in sales commissions and higher marketing costs due to expanded promotional activities including advertising and trade show participation 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of personnel associated with product development and related benefits and recruiting costs and related consulting expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  legal  accounting and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased personnel  consultants  facilities expenses and outside services necessary to support our growth 
amortization of stock based compensation in connection with the granting of stock options to employees  we recorded stock based compensation totaling approximately million through december  subsequent to the mergers with business evolution and netdialog  we granted options to certain employees hired from the acquired companies for an exercise price below the fair market value of the common stock 
these options immediately vested on the date of grant 
the difference between the market value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price of the options was recorded as compensation expense in the fourth quarter of in the amount of approximately million 
acquisition related costs in connection with the merger with connectify  we recorded a nonrecurring charge for merger integration costs of million consisting primarily of transaction fees for attorneys and accountants of approximately  and employee severance benefits and facility related costs of  in in connection with the mergers with business evolution and netdialog  we recorded a nonrecurring charge for merger integration costs of million  consisting primarily of transaction fees for attorneys and accountants of approximately million  advertising and announcements of million incurred as of december   charges for the elimination of duplicate facilities of approximately  and severance costs and certain other related costs of approximately  other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments  offset by interest expense related to warrants issued to convertible debt holders 
other income  net decreased by to an expense of  for the year ended december  from income of  for the decrease in other income expense  net was due primarily to interest expense associated with warrants issued to convertible debt holders offset by increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources in june  we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
in september  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock and realized net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
prior to the initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily from private sales of convertible preferred and common stock totaling million and  to a lesser extent  from bank borrowings and lease financing 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
we estimate that we will have approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  these uses are primarily attributable to net losses experienced during these periods as we invested in the development of our products  expansion of our sales force and expansion of our infrastructure to support our growth and increase in sales leading to an increase in accounts receivable 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  our investing activities consisting primarily of net sales of short term investments  cash acquired from the acquisition of silknet  offset by purchases of computer equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements to support our growing number of employees  provided million of cash for the year ended december  our investing activities used million of cash for the year ended december   which is primarily due to purchases of short term investments and computer equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds from the private placement in june of  shares of our common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
our financing activities provided million for the year ended december   primarily from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and proceeds from notes payable and issuance of convertible preferred stock 
we have a line of credit totaling million  which is secured by all of our assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate as of december   and expires on july  the line of credit contains certain financial covenants including a quick asset ratio of at least and a tangible net worth of at least  we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  total borrowings as of december  and were  under this line of credit 
the entire balance under this line of credit is due on the expiration date  july  our total bank debt  including the borrowings under the line of credit  was million at december  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
we expect to devote resources to continue our research and development efforts  and expand our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations 
in addition  although we have curtailed capital expenditures  we have made commitments to establish additional facilities and infrastructure growth  which we will need to fund 
we have experienced substantial increases in expenditures since our inception consistent with growth in our operations and personnel  and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
to reduce our expenditures  we recently restructured in several areas  including reduced staffing  expense management and curtailed capital spending 
for example  in the first quarter of  we reduced our workforce by approximately  in order to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with industry standards 
however  these actions will not be sufficient for us to obtain a positive cash flow 
therefore  we plan to further reduce our expenditures 
our auditors have included a paragraph in their report indicating that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are uncertain whether our cash balance  collections on our accounts receivable and funding from projected operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next months and believe it will be necessary for us to substantially increase revenues and reduce expenditures 
if we are unable to substantially increase revenues  reduce expenditures and collect upon accounts receivable or if we incur unexpected expenditures  then we will need to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern 
especially in light of our declining stock price and the extreme volatility in the technology capital markets  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  although there are no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies  we may  from time to time  evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and technologies 
in order to consummate potential acquisitions  we may issue additional securities or need additional equity or debt financing and any financing may be dilutive to existing investors 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities which is effective in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas did not have any material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance for revenue recognition under certain circumstances 
sab became effective in the quarter beginning october  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
risk factors our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and our other public filings 
this report contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described in risks related to our business  risks related to our industry and elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business because we have a limited operating history  there is limited information upon which you can evaluate our business we are still in the early stages of our development  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in july and first recorded revenue in february thus  we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible to predict future results of operations 
for example  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on our historical results because they are limited  and we are required to forecast expenses in part on future revenue projections 
moreover  due to our limited operating history  any evaluation of our business and prospects must be made in light of the risks and uncertainties often encountered by early stage companies in internet related markets 
many of these risks are discussed in the subheadings below  and include our ability to 
attract more customers  
implement our sales  marketing and after sales service initiatives  both domestically and internationally  
execute our product development activities  
anticipate and adapt to the changing internet market  
attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  
respond to actions taken by our competitors  
continue to build an infrastructure to effectively manage growth and handle any future increased usage  and 
integrate acquired businesses  technologies  products and services 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter particularly because our products and services are relatively new and our prospects uncertain 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the factors described in the subheadings below as well as 
the evolving and varying demand for customer communication software products and services for e businesses  particularly our products and services  
budget and spending decisions by information technology departments of our customers  
costs associated with integrating our recent acquisitions  and costs associated with any future acquisitions  
our ability to manage our expenses  
the timing of new releases of our products  
the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing and budgetary cycles  
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  
the timing of execution of large contracts that materially affect our operating results  
the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  
the mix of our domestic and international sales  
costs related to the customization of our products  
our ability to expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  and 
decisions by customers and potential customers to delay purchasing our products  and 
global economic conditions  as well as those specific to large enterprises with high e mail volume 
we also often offer volume based pricing  which may affect operating margins 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
therefore  this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
in addition  because our service revenue is largely correlated with our license revenue  a decline in license revenue could also cause a decline in service revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or funding to continue as a going concern since we began operations in  our revenues have not been sufficient to support our operations  and we have incurred substantial operating losses in every quarter 
as a result of accumulated operating losses  we have a significant accumulated deficit 
this has caused some of our potential customers to question our viability  which has in turn hampered our ability to sell some of our products 
since inception  we have funded our business primarily through selling our stock  not from cash generated by our business 
our growth in recent periods has been from a limited base of customers  and we may not be able to increase revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing expenditures 
we may not be able to increase the growth of our revenues in the future 
as a result  we expect to continue to experience losses and negative cash flows  even if sales of our products and services continue to grow  and we may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability in the future 
accordingly  we plan to reduce our operating expenses and may require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
with the decline in our stock price  any such financing is likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders 
our auditors have included a paragraph in their report indicating that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may incur non cash charges related to issuances of our equity which could harm our operating results further  in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to accenture pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement dated september   we will incur substantial charges to stock based compensation 
with respect to the  shares of common stock  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation which will be amortized over the four year term of our global strategic alliance with accenture based upon the fair market value of our common stock on september   the date of closing  of per share 
with respect to the warrant   shares of common stock were fully vested and exercisable under the warrant and were valued on september  using the black scholes model and are being amortized over four years 
on the unearned portion of the warrant  we will incur a charge to stock based compensation when certain performance goals are achieved 
this charge will be measured using the black scholes valuation model and the fair market value of our common stock at the time of achievement of these goals 
accordingly  significant increases in our stock price could result in substantial non cash accounting charges and variations in our results of operations 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase any profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel necessary to develop our engineering  professional services and support capabilities in order to continue to grow we may increase our sales  marketing  engineering  professional services and product management personnel in the future 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business cannot continue to grow if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained personnel that are integral to our product development and professional services group  which is the group responsible for implementation and customization of  and technical support for  our products and services  may limit the rate at which we can develop and install new products or product enhancements  which would harm our business 
we may need to increase our staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers  without compromising the quality of our customer service 
since our inception  a number of employees have left or have been terminated  and we expect to lose more employees in the future 
recently  we restructured our organization and terminated a significant number of employees in the process 
hiring qualified professional services personnel  as well as sales  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel  is very competitive in our industry  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where we are headquartered  due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills 
we face greater difficulty attracting these personnel with equity incentives as a public company than we did as a privately held company 
in addition  in light of our recent workforce reduction  we may face additional difficulty in attracting and retaining these professionals and other key personnel 
also  the workforce reduction may adversely affect the morale of  and our ability to retain  those employees who are not being terminated 
because our stock price has recently suffered a significant decline  stock based compensation  including options to purchase our common stock  may have diminished effectiveness as employee hiring and retention devices 
if our retention efforts are ineffective  employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide client service and execute our strategy would be negatively affected 
we may face difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified sales personnel to sell our products and services  which could harm our ability to increase our revenues in the future our financial success depends to a large degree on the ability of our direct sales force to increase sales to a level required to adequately fund marketing and product development activities 
therefore  our ability to increase revenues in the future depends considerably upon our success in recruiting  training and retaining additional direct sales personnel and the success of the direct sales force 
also  it may take a new salesperson a number of months before he or she becomes a productive member of our sales force 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespeople fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
our workforce reduction and financial performance may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel in connection with our effort to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with industry standards  we recently restructured our organization in the first quarter of with reductions in our workforce by approximately employees 
there may be costs associated with the workforce reduction related to severance and other employee related costs  and our restructuring plan may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plans 
we recently filed a tender offer statement on schedule to announcing our offer to exchange certain eligible options outstanding under our stock option plans for new options to purchase shares of our common stock and for restricted shares of our common stock 
our employees may not elect to tender their options outstanding in exchange for new options and restricted stock and thus the intended result of the shares exchange program  to create performance and retention incentives  may not be realized 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
we have appointed a new chief executive officer  a new president  a new interim chief financial officer  and a new chief operating officer  and the integration of these officers may interfere with our operations in february  we announced the appointment of art 
m 
rodriguez as our interim chief financial officer  replacing james c 
wood  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  who was appointed as our interim chief financial officer in january  in january  we announced the appointment of james c 
wood as our new chief executive officer  interim chief financial officer and chairman of the board  in connection with the january resignations of our former chief executive officer and chairman of the board  michael j 
mccloskey  for health reasons  and of our former chief financial officer  brian k 
allen  for personal reasons 
we also announced the appointment of david b 
fowler as our new president and nigel k 
donovan as our new chief operating officer 
the transitions of messrs 
rodriguez  wood  fowler and donovan has resulted and will continue to result in disruption to our ongoing operations  and these transitions may materially harm the way that the market perceives our company and the price of our common stock 
loss of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers could harm our business our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management 
in particular  we depend upon the continued services of mr 
wood 
the loss of the services of mr 
wood or any of our executive officers could harm our business and operations 
in addition  we have not obtained life insurance benefiting us on any of our employees or entered into employment agreements with our key employees 
if any of our key employees left or was seriously injured and unable to work and we were unable to find a qualified replacement  our business could be harmed 
we face substantial competition and may not be able to compete effectively the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
in addition  changes in the perceived needs of customers for specific products  features and services may result in our products becoming uncompetitive 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we currently face competition for our products from systems designed by in house and third party development efforts 
we expect that these systems will continue to be a principal source of competition for the foreseeable future 
our competitors include a number of companies offering one or more products for the e business communications and relationship management market  some of which compete directly with our products 
for example  our competitors include companies providing stand alone point solutions  including annuncio  inc  askjeeves  inc  brightware  inc  broadbase  inc  digital impact  inc  egain communications corp  e 
piphany  inc  inference corp  marketfirst  inc  live person  inc  mustang software  inc 
which was acquired by quintus corporation  responsys 
com and servicesoft  inc which was acquired by broadbase software  inc 
in addition  we compete with companies providing traditional  client server based customer management and communications solutions  such as clarify inc which was acquired by northern telecom  alcatel  cisco systems  inc  lucent technologies  inc  message media  inc  oracle corporation  pivotal corporation  siebel systems  inc and vantive corporation which was acquired by peoplesoft  inc 
changes in our products may also impact the ability of our sales force to effectively sell 
furthermore  we may face increased competition should we expand our product line  through acquisition of complementary businesses or otherwise 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
we may lose potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including the ability or willingness of competitors to offer lower prices and other incentives that we cannot match 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of recently announced industry consolidations  as well as future consolidations 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
our failure to consummate our expected sales in any given quarter could dramatically harm our operating results because of the large size of typical orders our sales cycle is subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
consequently  if sales expected from a specific customer in a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we are unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of a typical order  a lost or delayed sale could result in revenues that are lower than expected 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than anticipated  revenues for subsequent quarters may be lower than expected 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our products have a long and variable sales cycle the long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
to date  the sales cycle for our products has taken to months in the united states and longer in foreign countries 
our sales cycle has required pre purchase evaluation by a significant number of individuals in our customers organizations 
along with third parties that often jointly market our software with us  we invest significant amounts of time and resources educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
many of our customers evaluate our software slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment  and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy our products 
in the event of an economic downturn  the sales cycle for our products may become longer and it may require more resources to complete sales 
our stock price has been highly volatile and has experienced a significant drop  particularly because our business depends on the internet  and may continue to be volatile and drop the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology and computer software companies  particularly internet related companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our common stock reached a high of and traded as low as in the year  and on february  the last reported sales price of the shares on the nasdaq stock market was 
future sales of stock could affect our stock price if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
difficulties in implementing our products could harm our revenues and margins forecasting our revenues depends upon the timing of implementation of our products 
this implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project 
some customers may also require us to develop customized features or capabilities 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services support or customized features  our revenue recognition could be further delayed and our costs could increase  causing increased variability in our operating results 
our business depends on the acceptance of our products and services  and it is uncertain whether the market will accept our products and services we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and deploy our products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services 
in the future  we may not be successful in marketing our products and services  including any new or enhanced products 
a failure to manage our internal operating and financial functions could lead to inefficiencies in conducting our business and subject us to increased expenses our ability to offer our products and services successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have limited experience in managing rapid growth 
we have recently experienced a period of growth that has placed a significant strain on our managerial  financial and personnel resources 
our business will suffer if we fail to manage this growth successfully 
our number of employees has grown more than ten fold since june   when we had employees  and we expect to continue to hire new employees at a rapid rate 
moreover  we will need to assimilate substantially all of silknet s operations into our operations 
the rate of our recent growth has made management of that growth more difficult 
any additional growth will further strain our management  financial  personnel  internal training and other resources 
to manage any future growth effectively  we must improve our financial and accounting systems  controls  reporting systems and procedures  integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
any failure to do so could negatively affect the quality of our products  our ability to respond to our customers and retain key personnel  and our business in general 
delays in the development of new products or enhancements to existing products would hurt our sales and damage our reputation to be competitive  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements for companies with significant e business customer interactions needs 
our ability to deliver competitive products may be impacted by the resources we have to devote to the suite of products  the rate of change of competitive products and required company responses to changes in the demands of our customers 
any failure to do so could harm our business 
if we experience product delays in the future  we may face 
customer dissatisfaction  
cancellation of orders and license agreements  
negative publicity  
loss of revenues  
slower market acceptance  and 
legal action by customers 
in the future  our efforts to remedy this situation may not be successful and we may lose customers as a result 
delays in bringing to market new products or their enhancements  or the existence of defects in new products or their enhancements  could be exploited by our competitors 
if we were to lose market share as a result of lapses in our product management  our business would suffer 
technical problems with either our internal or outsourced computer and communications systems could interrupt our kana online service the success of the kana online service depends on the recruitment and retainment of qualified staff as well as the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our own and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar adverse events 
we have entered into an internet hosting agreement with two data center s  exodus communications  inc to maintain all of the kana online servers at exodus data center in santa clara  california servicing our west coast customers  and uunet s data center in princeton  new jersey servicing our east coast customers 
our operations depend on both exodus and uunet s ability to protect its and our systems in exodus and uunet s data center against damage or interruption 
both data centers do not guarantee that our internet access will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
we have no formal disaster recovery plan in the event of damage or interruption  and our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur 
any system failure that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness could harm our relationships with customers and result in reduced revenues 
we are currently contemplating outsourcing the management and operation of the kana online service 
if we proceed with such plan with a third party  we may have less control over the operations of the service  which could also harm our relationships with customers and result in reduced revenues 
if we fail to build skills necessary to sell our kana online service  we will lose revenue opportunities and our sales will suffer the skills necessary to market and sell kana online are different from those relating to our software products 
we license our software products for a fixed fee based on the number of concurrent users and the optional applications purchased 
we license kana online based on a fixed fee for installation  configuration and training  and a variable monthly component depending on actual customer usage 
our sales force sells both our software products and kana online 
because different skills are necessary to sell kana online as compared to selling software products  our sales and marketing groups may not be able to maintain or increase the level of sales of either kana online or our software products 
our pending patents may never be issued and  even if issued  may provide little protection our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we regard the protection of patentable inventions as important to our future opportunities 
we currently have one issued us patent and eight us patent applications pending relating to our software 
although we have filed four international patent applications corresponding to four of our us patent applications  none of our technology is patented outside of the united states 
it is possible that 
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  
any patents issued may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  
any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  
current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents  and 
effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
in the united states  we currently have a registered trademark  kana  and seven pending trademark applications  including trademark applications for our logo and kana communications and design 
outside of the united states  we have two trademark registrations in the european union  one trademark registration in australia  and we have additional trademark applications pending in australia  canada  the european union  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
however  despite the precautions that we have taken 
laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies  
current federal laws that prohibit software copying provide only limited protection from software pirates  and effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  
other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and 
policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use 
also  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may become involved in litigation over proprietary rights  which could be costly and time consuming substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry 
we expect that software in our industry may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties may currently have  or may eventually be issued  patents upon which our products or technology infringe 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us 
many of our software license agreements require us to indemnify our customers from any claim or finding of intellectual property infringement 
any litigation  brought by us or others  could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
in addition  litigation in which we are accused of infringement might cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  which might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  our business could be significantly harmed 
we may face higher costs and lost sales if our software contains errors we face the possibility of higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of our products and services  undetected errors are of particular concern 
we have only a few beta customers that test new features and functionality of our software before we make these features and functionalities generally available to our customers 
if our software contains undetected errors or we fail to meet customers expectations in a timely manner  we could experience 
loss of or delay in revenues expected from the new product and an immediate and significant loss of market share  
loss of existing customers that upgrade to the new product and of new customers  
failure to achieve market acceptance  
diversion of development resources  
injury to our reputation  
increased service and warranty costs  
legal actions by customers  and 
increased insurance costs 
we may face liability claims that could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages 
however  these contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable and we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs  damaging our reputation and distracting our management 
our international operations could divert management attention and present financial issues our international operations are located throughout europe  australia  japan  singapore and brazil  and  to date  have been limited 
we may expand our existing international operations and establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
we may face difficulties in accomplishing this expansion  including finding adequate staffing and management resources for our international operations 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
in addition  in order to expand our international sales operations  we will need to  among other things 
expand our international sales channel management and support organizations  
customize our products for local markets  and 
develop relationships with international service providers and additional distributors and system integrators 
our investments in establishing facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenues 
even if we are able to expand our international operations successfully  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
in addition  we have only licensed our products internationally since january and have limited experience in developing localized versions of our software and marketing and distributing them internationally 
localizing our products may take longer than we anticipate due to difficulties in translation and delays we may experience in recruiting and training international staff 
our growth could be limited if we fail to execute our plan to expand internationally for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   we derived approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside north america 
we have established offices in the united kingdom  australia  germany  japan  holland  france  spain  sweden  singapore and brazil 
as a result  we face risks from doing business on an international basis  any of which could impair our internal revenues 
we could  in the future  encounter greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  our international operations could cause our average tax rate to increase 
any of these events could harm our international sales and results of operations 
international laws and regulations may expose us to potential costs and litigation our international operations will increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information  which  if applied to the sale of our products and services  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we may suffer foreign exchange rate losses our international revenues and expenses are denominated in local currency 
therefore  a weakening of other currencies versus the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities 
we have not yet but may in the future experience significant foreign currency transaction losses  especially to the extent that we do not engage in hedging 
our prospects for obtaining additional financing  if required  are uncertain and failure to obtain needed financing could affect our ability to pursue future growth we may need to raise additional funds to develop or enhance our products or services  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
we do not have a long enough operating history to know with certainty whether our existing cash and expected revenues will be sufficient to finance our anticipated growth 
additional financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund any potential expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
we have completed four mergers  and those mergers may result in disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel and operations we may not realize the benefits from the significant mergers we have completed 
in august  we acquired connectify  and in december  we acquired netdialog and business evolution 
on april   we completed our merger with silknet 
we may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and products into our business 
in particular  we will need to assimilate and retain key professional services  engineering and marketing personnel 
this is particularly difficult with business evolution and silknet  since their operations are located on the east coast and we are headquartered on the west coast 
key personnel from the acquired companies have in certain instances decided  and they may in the future decide  that they do not want to work for us 
in addition  products of these companies will have to be integrated into our products  and it is uncertain whether we may accomplish this easily or at all 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky and we may also face unexpected costs  which may adversely affect operating results in any quarter 
the merger of silknet into our company could adversely affect combined financial results if the benefits of the merger of silknet into our company do not exceed the costs associated with the merger  including any dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
in addition  we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately billion in connection with the merger 
as a result of the acquisition of silknet  we recorded significant intangible assets which  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are required to be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the goodwill and intangible assets related to the merger with silknet for impairment and  as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of billion 
if we acquire additional companies  products or technologies  we may face risks similar to those faced in our other mergers if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we intend to make other investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to our other mergers 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our company or our existing stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
our executive officers and directors can exercise significant influence over stockholder voting matters as of february   our executive officers and directors  and their affiliates together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will have a significant impact on all matters requiring approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay  prevent or deter a change in control of our company  could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the market price of our common stock 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
moreover  without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and equity compensation plans include provisions that may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase our company 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company 
furthermore  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected each year 
directors are removable by the affirmative vote of at least of all classes of voting stock 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
risks related to our industry our failure to manage multiple technologies and technological change could harm our future product demand future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
the market for e business customer communication software is characterized by 
rapid technological change  
frequent new product introductions  
changes in customer requirements  and 
evolving industry standards 
our products are designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  our software may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments and other systems that our customers use 
for example  the server component of the current version of our products runs on the windows nt operating system from microsoft  and we must develop products and services that are compatible with unix and other operating systems to meet the demands of our customers 
if we cannot successfully develop these products in response to customer demands  our business could suffer 
also  we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to database systems and other back office applications and internet related applications 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications  which may cause confusion in the market and harm our business 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete  which would harm our business 
if we fail to respond to changing customer preferences in our market  demand for our products and our ability to enhance our revenues will suffer we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing software and to develop new services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers 
if we do not properly identify the feature preferences of prospective customers  or if we fail to deliver features that meet the requirements of these customers  our ability to market our products successfully and to increase our revenues could be impaired 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
if the internet and web based communications fail to grow and be accepted as media of communication  demand for our products and services will decline we sell our products and services primarily to organizations that receive large volumes of e mail and web based communications 
many of our customers have business models that are based on the continued growth of the internet 
consequently  our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the continued acceptance and use of the internet and e mail  which are evolving as media of communication 
rapid growth in the use of e mail is a recent phenomenon and may not continue 
as a result  a broad base of enterprises that use e mail as a primary means of communication may not develop or be maintained 
in addition  the market may not accept recently introduced products and services that process e mail  including our products and services 
moreover  companies that have already invested significant resources in other methods of communications with customers  such as call centers  may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may limit or compete with their existing investments 
if businesses do not continue to accept the internet and e mail as media of communication  our business will suffer 
future regulation of the internet may slow our growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that state  federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on those companies that conduct business online 
these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e mail or other web based communications  particularly targeted e mail of the type facilitated by the connectify product  which could reduce demand for our products and services 
the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that may inhibit the use of internet based communications or the information contained in these communications 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet  particularly as it relates to online communication  could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
our costs could increase and our growth could be harmed by any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services
