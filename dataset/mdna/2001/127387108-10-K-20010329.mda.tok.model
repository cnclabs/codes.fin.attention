results of operations revenue change in millions product services maintenance total revenue    sources of revenue as a percent of total revenue product services maintenance product revenue increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to an overall increase in price and volume of license renewals with major customers 
the increases in sales volume of products was primarily attributable to increased sales of intellectual property creation products  which include mixed signal and simulation products  integrated circuit implementation products  which include place and route  physical design  and physical verification products  and printed circuit board related products 
product revenue decreased million in  when compared to  primarily due to the implementation of cadence s new software subscription licensing model during the third quarter of and to a lesser extent a decrease in sales volume of cadence s software products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in emulation hardware product revenue in the same periods and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate differences  primarily the japanese yen 
revenue associated with software products under subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the license period because the agreements allow customers to exchange licensed products for unspecified future technology 
services revenue increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to an increase in tality revenue of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in methodology services revenue 
tality s revenue increase is primarily due to increases in the total size of active client engagements and total client service hours billed 
the decrease in methodology services engagements is primarily due to lower staffing levels 
services revenue increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to an increase in tality revenue of million 
tality s increase is primarily due to an increase in the total size of active client engagements and an increase in total client service hours billed 
maintenance revenue increased million in when compared to  primarily due to the growth of the installed customer base 
maintenance revenue was relatively flat in compared to revenue by geography change in millions domestic international total revenue    revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue domestic international international revenue decreased million in when compared to  primarily due to decreases in product revenue in japan and services revenue in europe and japan  partially offset by an increase in product and maintenance revenue in europe 
international revenue decreased million in when compared to  primarily due to decreases in product revenue in all international regions resulting from the implementation of cadence s new subscription licensing model during the third quarter of the decrease in international product revenue was partially offset by an increase in services revenue in all international regions except asia 
other differences in the rate of revenue growth over the years presented and as compared geographically are primarily due to fluctuations in sales volume of place and route and physical design products and for cadence s design and methodology services offerings 
foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected reported revenue by million in  primarily due to the weakening of the british pound and german mark in relation to the us dollar  partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rates positively affected reported revenue by million in  primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar 
additional information about revenue by geographic areas can be found under segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenue change in millions product services maintenance cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue product services maintenance cost of product revenue includes costs of production personnel  packaging and documentation  royalties  and amortization of capitalized software development costs for software products 
manufacturing costs associated with hardware emulation system products include materials  labor  and overhead 
cost of product revenue increased million or in when compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in manufacturing expenses associated with emulation system products and amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of product revenue increased million or in when compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in manufacturing expenses associated with emulation system products  the acquisition of orcad in  and amortization of capitalized software development costs 
these costs were offset partially by inventory obsolescence charges of million associated with the introduction of the mercury design verification system recorded in  reductions in purchased software amortization  and third party royalty expenses 
because the majority of cadence s cost of software product revenue does not vary significantly with changes in revenue  product gross margin increased in when compared to  due primarily to increased sales of software products and the introduction of the new subscription licensing model during the third quarter of cost of services revenue includes costs associated with providing services to customers  primarily salaries and benefits  costs to recruit  develop and retain personnel  cost of software  depreciation  facilities and project management  and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization 
cost of services revenue increased million or in  when compared to  primarily due to an increase in the number of design engineers 
cost of services revenue increased million or in  when compared to  primarily due to increases in amortization of purchased software and distributor commission costs for methodology services in japan  offset partially by a decrease in employee related costs  including incentive pay  associated primarily with cadence s restructuring and lower revenues 
services gross margins remained relatively flat in as compared to the increase in services gross margins to in  as compared to in  was primarily due to increased utilization of services capacity and the management of expenses 
services gross margins have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the cost of integrating new services professionals as well as cadence s inability to fully utilize these resources 
in addition  services gross margins may continue to be adversely affected by cadence s inability to achieve operating efficiencies with its resources when implementing a growing number of service offerings 
cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services  such as hot line and on site support  production personnel  packaging  and documentation of maintenance updates 
cost of maintenance revenue increased million or in  when compared to  primarily due to costs associated with the orcad acquisition which was completed in the third quarter of  for which there were no similar costs in the first seven months of  and increases in employee related costs and costs to invest in customer service 
cost of maintenance revenue in absolute dollars and as a percent of related revenue remained relatively flat in when compared to amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles as a percent of total revenue amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to a full year s amortization related to cadence s acquisitions of orcad and diablo  partially offset by the decrease in amortization related to the million asset impairment charge of exd in the fourth quarter of amortization of acquired intangibles increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to the acquisitions of orcad and dai  and a full year s amortization related to cadence s acquisitions of ambit  blda  exd  and symbionics

operating expenses change in millions marketing and sales research and development general and administrative operating expenses as a percent of total revenue marketing and sales research and development general and administrative marketing and sales the increase in marketing and sales expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs  the acquisition of orcad  and marketing program costs  partially offset by lower consulting costs 
foreign currency exchange rates positively affected marketing and sales expenses by million in  when compared to  primarily due to the weakening of the german mark  the french franc  and the british pound in relation to the us dollar  partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily due to an increase in sales support costs  the acquisition of orcad  and marketing program costs  partially offset by lower employee related costs  resulting from cadence s restructuring  lower employee training and education costs  and travel costs 
foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected marketing and sales expenses by million in  when compared to  primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar 
research and development the increase in net research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to higher employee related costs  the acquisition of orcad which was completed in the third quarter of and for which there were no similar costs in the first seven months of  and consulting and other services 
the increase in net research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to higher employee related costs due to increases in headcount from cadence s acquisition of orcad in and the acquisitions of ambit and blda in the third quarter of  partially offset by increased capitalization of software development expenses 
cadence s expenses in research and development  prior to the reduction for capitalization of software development costs  was million for  million for  and million for  representing of total revenue for  for  and for cadence capitalized software development costs of approximately million for  million for  and million for  which represented approximately of total research and development expenditures for   and the increase in capitalized software development costs in each of these three years resulted primarily from general increases in new product development 
the amount of capitalized software development costs in any given period may vary depending on the exact nature of the development performed 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million in  when compared to  primarily due to employee related costs  partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense and consulting and outside services costs 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in when compared to amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of total revenue amortization of deferred stock compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to tality employees and directors  and restricted stock sales to certain cadence executives and key employees  and the deemed fair market value of tality s common stock at the time of those grants and sales 
for the year ended december   cadence recorded a total of million of deferred stock compensation  million related to the stock option grants  and million related to the restricted stock sales 
cadence is amortizing deferred stock compensation to expense over the period during which the stock options and restricted stock vest  four years and one year  respectively 
unusual items described below are unusual item charges in   and in millions separation costs write off of acquired in process technology asset impairment restructuring charges merger costs litigation settlement total unusual items separation costs in the year ended december   cadence recorded million in separation costs related to the separation of its design services business  and the related planned ipo of tality  cadence s newly formed subsidiary 
these costs primarily include legal and accounting services  strategic business planning  information systems separation  development of compensation and benefits strategies  and recruitment and formation of tality s senior management team 
in process technology in august  cadence acquired orcad  inc  a supplier of computer aided engineering and computer aided design software and services for the printed circuit board industry  for cash 
cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of orcad and assumed all outstanding orcad stock options 
the purchase price was million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
upon consummation of the orcad acquisition  cadence immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
certain acquired in process technology was commercially viable in and other acquired in process technology became commercially viable in expenditures to complete this acquired in process technology did not exceed million 
at the time of its acquisition by cadence  orcad s in process research and development projects in the schematic entry area were related to the development of an online component catalog and a new schematic design entry interface 
in process research and development projects in the simulation area were related to a rearchitecture of the simulation engine and replacement of the simulation engine 
additional features under development included randomized expressions and no selection limits 
the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related  in varying degrees  to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at orcad used to value the purchased research and development were based on management s estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects 
the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects address  cadence s ability to gain market acceptance in these segments  and the life cycle of this in process technology 
estimated total revenue from the acquired in process technology is expected to peak in and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market 
in addition  a portion of the anticipated revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development  and had been excluded from net cash flow calculations 
existing technology was valued at million 
the net cash flows generated from the acquired in process technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation of approximately of the sales generated from in process technology 
however  there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate  or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition 
the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on the required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology was 
the discount rate is sometimes higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates  including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which were unknown at that time 
in january  cadence acquired dai  a supplier of design verification technology used in soc design 
cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of dai for approximately million shares of cadence common stock and million of cash 
the total purchase price was million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
upon consummation of the dai acquisition  cadence immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use

the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
certain acquired in process technology under development at the time of acquisition was initially expected to become commercially viable in  but instead became viable in expenditures to complete this in process technology did not exceed million 
at the time of its acquisition by cadence  dai had several significant research and development projects in process that were intended to provide a next generation environment for design verification and analysis 
these efforts included the development of a highly automated approach for high level test bench creation and analysis  a waveform viewer capable of supporting analog and mixed signal designs  and a tool designed to analyze verification code coverage at the transactional level 
the nature of the efforts to complete these in process research and development projects related  in varying degrees  to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed in process technologies meet their design specifications  which include functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the net cash flows generated by the projects underway at dai used to value the acquired in process technology were based on management s estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects

the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
the acquired in process technology was commercially viable in  with the exception of one module  called datapath compiler  which became commercially viable in buildgates software and physically knowledgeable synthesis were commercially viable in expenditures to complete all in process technology did not exceed million 
at the time of its acquisition by cadence  ambit was working on several significant research and development projects that were intended to provide the next generation version of its existing product  buildgates the nature of the efforts to complete the next generation version of buildgates related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications  including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
cadence expects ambit s creation of a fundamentally new approach to synthesis in deep submicron and in soc to create the opportunity for additional revenue through the creation of an integrated  next generation version of buildgates software 
in september  cadence acquired blda for cash 
blda was a design automation development organization that focused on the complex verification challenges companies face when designing integrated circuits and next generation soc 
the total purchase price was million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
upon consummation of the blda acquisition  cadence immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use

the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate includes a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
the acquired in process technology became commercially viable in expenditures to complete this in process technology did not exceed million 
blda s in process research and development projects were related to its formalcheck r and clover r technologies 
blda had two major enhancements underway for formalcheck 
this effort resulted in a revenue generating product in blda s research and development related to clover technology involved the design and development of new parasitic extraction tools  which were expected to substantially improve the performance and functionality of the technology 
the parasitic extraction tools began generating revenue in the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at ambit and blda used to value the purchased research and development were based on management s estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects 
the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects address  cadence s ability to gain market acceptance for these projects  and the life cycle of this in process technology 
estimated total revenue from the acquired in process technology is expected to peak in through and decline rapidly in and as other new products enter the market 
in addition  a portion of the anticipated revenue has been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development  and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations 
existing technology was valued at million in connection with the ambit acquisition and million in connection with the blda acquisition 
there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate  or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisitions 
the net cash flows generated from the acquired in process technology are expected to reflect earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation of approximately to of the sales generated from this in process technology 
the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the wacc 
the discount rates used to discount the net cash flows from acquired in process technology were for ambit and for blda 
these discount rates reflected the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which were unknown at that time 
in march  cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of exd 
exd provided asic and soc design and library development 
the total purchase price was million in cash and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
upon consummation of the exd acquisition  cadence immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use

the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
the in process projects were expected to be commercially viable on dates ranging from the end of through however  the progression of these projects became impaired in the fourth quarter of as discussed further below 
at the time of its acquisition by cadence  exd had several significant research and development projects in process that  if successful  would have represented the introduction of new products and technologies to meet future market needs 
these efforts included the development of new tools for library generation  delay calculation  memory compilation  and semiconductor intellectual property technology 
these new technologies were intended to be fully supportive of deep submicron design functions  which are a critical market requirement 
the nature of the efforts required to complete these research and development projects related  to varying degrees  to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications  including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the successful completion of the exd acquired in process projects has been impaired and as a result differed significantly from the forecasted assumptions 
in the fourth quarter of  cadence recorded a million asset impairment charge 
this asset impairment charge resulted from reduced japanese market opportunities and the loss of key exd employees resulting in diminished cash flow projections 
cadence entered into certain support agreements with external parties to provide support for exd software tools previously sold to cadence customers 
the fair value of the exd acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation of the present value of their estimated expected future cash flows  discounted at 
in february  cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of symbionics for approximately million shares of cadence common stock and million of cash 
symbionics provided product development design services to leading electronics manufacturers

one of the new facilities is a million three year revolving credit facility  referred to as the three year facility 
the other new facility is a million day revolving credit facility convertible into a two year term loan  referred to as the day facility

foreign currency risk cadence s operations include transactions in foreign currencies and  as such  cadence benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on cadence s results of operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar  offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 
cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency put options with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities and probable but not firmly committed transactions  respectively 
forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and  therefore  the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income  net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities 
cadence purchases put options to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions 
probable but not firmly committed transactions consist of revenue from cadence s products and maintenance contracts in a currency other than the functional currency 
these transactions are made through cadence s subsidiaries in ireland and japan 
the premium costs of the put options are recorded in other current assets while the gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction 
gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction 
cadence does not use forward contracts and put options for trading purposes 
cadence s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the forward contracts and put options mature 
the table below provides information as of december  about cadence s forward contracts 
as of december   there were no put options outstanding

on a net basis  foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on cadence s results of operations and financial position during the year ended december  the realized gain loss on the forward contracts as they matured was not material to the consolidated operations of cadence 
equity price risk as part of its authorized repurchase program  cadence has sold put warrants and purchased call options through equity derivative transactions

if the market price of the stock is greater than the exercise price of a call option  cadence will typically exercise the option and receive shares of its stock 
if the market price of the common stock is less than the exercise price of a call option  cadence typically will not exercise the option 
call option issuers may accumulate a substantial number of shares of cadence common stock in anticipation of cadence s exercising its call option and may dispose of these shares if and when cadence fails to exercise its call option 
this could cause the market price of cadence common stock to fall 
depending on the exercise price of the put warrants and the market price of cadence common stock at the time of exercise  net share settlement of the put warrants with cadence common stock could cause cadence to issue a substantial number of shares to the holder of the put warrant 
the holder may sell these shares in the open market  which could cause the price of cadence common stock to fall 
put warrant holders may accumulate a substantial number of shares of cadence common stock in anticipation of exercising their put warrants and may dispose of these shares if and when they exercise their put warrants and cadence issues shares in settlement of their put warrants 
this could also cause the market price of cadence common stock to fall
