item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k may contain certain projections  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed above at item business risk and uncertainties and item business risk and uncertainties forward looking statements 
while this outlook represents management s current judgment on the future direction of the business  such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof 
overview triangle is engaged in the development of new drug candidates primarily for serious viral diseases 
since our inception on july   our operating activities have related primarily to recruiting personnel  negotiating license and option arrangements for our drug candidates  raising working capital and developing our drug candidates 
we have not received any revenues from the sale of products and do not believe it likely that any of our drug candidates will be commercially available until at least the year as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we require substantial working capital to fund the development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates 
we will require significant expenditures to fund pre clinical testing  clinical research studies  drug synthesis and manufacturing  license obligations  development of a sales and marketing infrastructure and ongoing administrative support before receiving regulatory approvals for our drug candidates 
these approvals may be delayed or not granted at all 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years 
because of the nature of our business  we expect that losses will fluctuate from period to period and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
see item business risk and uncertainties we have incurred losses since inception and may never achieve profitability 
you should consider the operating and financial risks associated with drug development activities when evaluating our prospects 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  successfully develop and commercialize our drug candidates  secure and maintain all necessary proprietary rights  respond to a rapidly changing competitive market  obtain additional financing and continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these risks 
see item business risk and uncertainties all of our product candidates are in development and may never be successfully commercialized which would have an adverse impact on your investment and our business and risk and uncertainties if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  we will have to curtail or cease operations 
our operating expenses are difficult to predict and will depend on several factors 
development expenses  including expenses for drug synthesis and manufacturing  pre clinical testing and clinical research activities  will depend on the ongoing requirements of our drug development programs and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our drug candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our consolidated operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
see item business risk and uncertainties the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
results of operations collaborative revenue collaborative revenue totaled million in as compared to no revenue in and revenue in is solely related to million of non contingent research and development expense reimbursements associated with the abbott alliance  which are being amortized over the anticipated research and development arrangement period 
see liquidity and capital resources 
license fees license fees totaled million in  compared to million in and to million in license fees in related to the recognition of milestone obligations and preservation fees under our license agreements and license or option agreement initiation and or preservation fees for several of our drug candidates 
license fees in related to achievement of milestone obligations  license fees associated with the license and settlement agreements with glaxo on the use of emtricitabine to treat hepatitis b  and license preservation fees for our drug candidate portfolio 
license fees in related primarily to execution of the clevudine license agreement as well as license preservation fees for our drug candidate portfolio 
the decrease in  as compared to and  is related to the timing of milestone obligations  the magnitude of license or option preservation payments  and the timing of license initiation fees associated with our portfolio of drug candidates 
future license fees may consist of milestone payments or annual preservation payments under existing licensing arrangements  the amount of which could be substantial and the timing of which will depend on a number of factors that we cannot predict 
these factors include  among others  the success of our drug development programs and the extent to which we may in license additional drug candidates 
see liquidity and capital resources 
development expenses development expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and to million in development expenses in were primarily for drug synthesis and manufacturing  clinical trials  employee compensation  pre clinical testing and consulting 
development expenses in were primarily for drug synthesis and manufacturing  pre clinical testing  clinical trials  employee compensation and consulting expenses 
development expenses in were primarily for drug synthesis and manufacturing  pre clinical testing  employee compensation and patent related activities for our drug candidates 
the substantial increase in development expenses as compared to and is due primarily to the more advanced development stage of some of our drug candidates and increased manufacturing costs 
a large percentage of these expenses were for the development of our drug candidate coviracil 
we are also continuing the development of coactinon  including the initiation of the enrollment of an additional patients in an ongoing phase iii clinical study 
our decision to continue the development of coactinon will result in additional future development costs for this drug candidate 
we expect our development expenses to increase in the future due to increased manufacturing  pre clinical and clinical testing for our existing portfolio of drug candidates as they enter later stages of development and in anticipation of commercial launch 
in addition  if we in license or otherwise acquire rights to additional drug candidates  development expenses would increase 
purchased research and development expense purchased research and development expense totaled million in  million in and there was no purchased research and development expense in purchased research and development expense in relates to the march issuance of  shares of our common stock to avid 
these  shares were part of the then remaining  contingent shares associated with our acquisition of avid as consideration to the former avid stockholders for extending the payment date of contingent consideration from february  to august  the second dmp milestone date extension 
we also increased the remaining number of contingent shares by  in consideration for extending the second dmp milestone date 
purchased research and development expense in related to the april issuance of  shares of common stock as consideration to the former avid stockholders for extending the payment date of contingent consideration from february  to february  the first dmp milestone date extension 
these in process research and development charges are based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date on which the extensions were granted and relate to mozenavir dimesylate  which is at an early stage of clinical development and has no alternative future use 
accordingly  if we initiate pivotal phase ii clinical trials with mozenavir dimesylate on or before august  or elect on or before august  to continue development of mozenavir dimesylate even if such clinical trials have not been initiated  we would issue  shares of common stock 
issuance of the remaining  of the then remaining  contingent shares is dependent upon the attainment of other development milestones with mozenavir dimesylate 
issuance of any additional contingent shares will be recorded as additional purchase price and will be allocated upon resolution of the underlying contingency 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in  compared to in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in consisted primarily of employee compensation  third party marketing  legal  investor relations and other professional services and rent expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses in and consisted primarily of amounts paid for employee compensation  marketing  legal  investor relations and other professional services and rent expense 
the decrease in as compared to  is due primarily to a reduction in sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in and selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to  relates to an overall increase in administrative expenses and the infrastructure necessary to support expanding corporate and development operations 
our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to support the commercial launch of our drug candidates 
interest income  net net interest income totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in  as compared to  is due to larger average investment balances and higher low risk  short term interest rates in the increase in interest income in as compared to was due to larger average investment balances in created by the proceeds received from the abbott alliance in september and from other equity financings in december see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception july   primarily with the net proceeds received from private placements of equity securities  which provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  and from initial and secondary public offerings  which provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  as well as net proceeds from the abbott alliance  including net proceeds from the sale of common stock and non contingent research and development reimbursement  of approximately million 
in addition  we have received approximately million as reimbursement of certain development expenses under our license agreements 
during  we completed our strategic alliance with abbott 
in addition to providing global sales  marketing  and manufacturing capabilities  the abbott alliance has provided approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock  approximately million of non contingent research and development expense reimbursements  and approximately million in reimbursed sales and marketing expenses under the abbott alliance profit and loss sharing arrangement 
at december   we had net working capital of million  a decrease of approximately million from december  the decrease in working capital is primarily the result of providing funds for our normal operating expenses 
our principal source of liquidity at december   was million in cash and cash equivalents  million in investments which are considered available for sale  and approximately million of strategic corporate investments  reflecting a million decrease of total cash  cash equivalent and investment balances from those at december  in  we entered into the facility  pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell up to million of our common stock over the next three years in the public market 
during a day selling period in december  we sold  shares of our common stock for net cash proceeds of approximately  under the facility 
see firm underwritten equity facility 
as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our pre clinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual arrangements with selected third parties to provide these services 
at december   we estimate the contractual commitment related to pre clinical and clinical testing to be approximately million and the contractual commitment to provide drug manufacturing to be approximately million 
these estimates may change in the future depending on the outcome of several project related variables 
our working capital requirements may continue to increase in future periods as we fund our drug development programs  pay obligations under our license and or option agreements  continue the future development of our sales and marketing organization  acquire drug substance from third party manufacturers  and incur other selling  general and administrative expenditures necessary to support our operations 
the amount of our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the cost of drugs supplied by third party contractors  including abbott  the success of our drug development programs  the magnitude and scope of these programs  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  changes in regulatory requirements  the costs under the license and or option agreements relating to our drug candidates including the costs of obtaining patent protection for our drug candidates  the timing and the terms of the acquisition of any additional drug candidates  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  determinations as to the commercial potential of our drug candidates  the level of required administrative and legal support  the potential expansion of required facility space and the potential use of third party sales contractors 
amounts payable by us in the future under our existing license agreements are uncertain due to a number of factors  including the progress of our drug development programs  our ability to obtain approval to commercialize drug candidates and the commercial success of certain approved drugs 
our existing license agreements  as of december   may require future cash payments of up to million contingent upon the achievement of development milestones  up to million upon the achievement of sales milestones  and million of future research and development payments 
one of our licensors has the option to receive million of future milestone payments in shares of common stock  based on the then current market price  in lieu of a cash payment 
as of december   we are also obligated to issue up to an additional  shares of common stock upon the achievement of development milestones relating to mozenavir dimesylate  which was acquired in the acquisition of avid 
additionally  we will pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales of each licensed product incorporating these drug candidates 
most of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments commencing three years after regulatory approval 
depending on our success and timing in obtaining regulatory approval  aggregate annual minimum royalties and license preservation fees under our existing license agreements could range from  if only a single drug candidate is approved for one indication  to million if all drug candidates are approved for all indications 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and expected net proceeds raised under the facility will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements through at least the first quarter of  but expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to fund our future operations from remaining availability under the facility  through our pending private offering or through equity or debt financings from other sources 
see pending private placement of million shares of common stock 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all 
see item business risk and uncertainties if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  we will have to curtail or cease operations 
firm underwritten equity facility on november   we entered into the facility with ramius consisting of a common stock underwriting agreement and a stand by purchase agreement 
ramius  as underwriter  has agreed to sell  on a best efforts basis  up to million of registered common stock over a three year period 
under the facility  we may initiate trading day selling periods during which ramius will purchase shares from us at a fixed percentage of the volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day 
we will establish a dollar amount to be raised during each selling period and a minimum selling price 
ramius will sell  on a best efforts basis  the number of shares required to raise that amount 
the total number of shares sold during a selling period is limited to of the average daily trading volume during the selling period 
we are not obligated to sell any shares of our common stock  and a selling period will not begin except upon our instruction 
in connection with the facility  we have agreed to pay ramius a commission of of gross proceeds and granted ramius the right to purchase  shares of our common stock at a share 
in connection with our pending private placement  we have agreed not to sell any common stock under the facility for a period of days from the effective date of the resale registration statement filed in connection with our pending private placement 
intelligent therapeutic solutions in the first quarter of  we contributed intellectual property and other assets to intelligent therapeutic solutions  inc  its  in exchange for  shares of its series a preferred stock 
on march   two outside investors purchased a non controlling ownership interest in its through a series b preferred stock investment for million with a binding commitment to invest an additional million 
its is a health information technology company formed to provide solutions in the management of patients with chronic and complex diseases  focusing primarily at the point of care on the provider patient relationship 
we do not expect that the future development costs of its s health information technology will impact our future consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flow since triangle has no continuing obligation to its 
dynavax technologies corporation in april  our licensing and collaborative agreement with dynavax to develop immunostimulatory pharmaceutical candidates for the prevention and or treatment of serious viral diseases became effective 
in association with this agreement  we purchased million of dynavax series t preferred stock 
the license grants triangle exclusive worldwide rights to dynavax proprietary iss for the treatment of hiv and the prevention and treatment of hepatitis b and hepatitis c 
this alliance represents another element of triangle s strategy to leverage strategic alliances with carefully selected partners 
we will collaborate with dynavax in the development of immunostimulatory pharmaceutical candidates and we will be responsible for funding development activities  as well as paying development milestones and royalty payments 
arrow therapeutics limited in july  we entered into a licensing and collaborative agreement with arrow to identify and develop novel anti viral agents for the treatment of hepatitis c virus 
under the terms of the agreement  arrow will provide triangle with access to arrow s high throughput screening technology and its compound library 
triangle will be responsible for funding the screening program  as well as paying development milestones and royalty payments on sales of any products which result from the collaboration 
pending private placement of million shares of common stock on january   we entered into definitive purchase agreements with a limited number of qualified institutional buyers and large institutional accredited investors for the sale of million shares of common stock at per share for gross proceeds totaling million 
the closing of the common stock sale will occur within three business days of the date the sec confirms its willingness to declare effective the resale registration statement  initially filed on february   in connection with the financing 
net proceeds are expected to be approximately million 
litigation and other contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are indirectly involved in several patent opposition and adversarial proceedings and two lawsuits filed in australia regarding the patent rights related to two of our licensed drug candidates  coviracil and dapd 
although we are not a named party in any of these proceedings  we are obligated to reimburse our licensors for legal expenses associated with these proceedings 
in one of these patent opposition proceedings  on november   the australian patent office held that several patent claims of emory directed to dapd are not patentable over an earlier biochem pharma patent 
emory has appealed this decision of the australian patent office to the australian federal court 
if emory  the university of georgia  or triangle is unsuccessful in the appeal  then we will not be able to sell dapd in australia without a license from biochem pharma  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
we cannot predict the outcome of this or any of the other proceedings 
we believe that an adverse judgment rendered against us would not result in a material financial obligation  nor would we have to recognize an impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of as no amounts have been capitalized related to our drug candidates 
however  any development in these proceedings adverse to our interests  including any adverse development related to the patent rights licensed to us for these two drug candidates or our related rights or obligations  could have a material adverse effect on our business and future consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
see item business risk and uncertainties if we or our licensors are not able to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for our product candidates  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates or to prevent other companies from using our technology in competitive products 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab sab  as amended by sab a and b  provided broad conceptual discussions and industry specific guidance concerning revenue recognition 
we adopted sab in and  accordingly  reported the impact of the abbott alliance in accordance with sab s conceptual guidance 
adoption of sab resulted in all non contingent research and development reimbursement to be amortized as collaborative revenue over the anticipated research and development arrangement period and will require the recognition of any contingent development milestone payments to be deferred and amortized beyond their actual receipt 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities  and requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
we adopted sfas in its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk triangle is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  investment market value and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
at december   we had approximately million of forward foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency firm commitments 
we have  however  established policies and procedures for market risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and investment market value 
interest rate sensitivity triangle is subject to interest rate risk on its investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality government and corporate bonds 
our portfolio has a current average maturity of less than months 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase by percent from levels at december   we expect that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial aggregate amount primarily due to the relatively short maturity of the portfolio 
at december   our portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows will be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our transactions occur in us dollars and we do not have subsidiaries or investments in foreign countries 
therefore  we are not subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk 
we have  however  established policies and procedures for market risk assessment  including a foreign currency hedging program 
the goal of our hedging program is to establish fixed exchange rates on firm foreign currency cash outflows and to minimize the impact to triangle of foreign currency fluctuations 
these policies specifically provide for the hedging of firm commitments and prohibit the holding of derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   triangle had purchased approximately million of forward foreign currency contracts in currencies participating in the european monetary union to hedge firm commitments 
the hypothetical loss associated with a percent devaluation of the euro would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flow 
strategic investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we also have a strategic investment in dynavax for million 
this investment represents unregistered preferred stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the investment
