item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed below and in the section entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to cytel are to cytel corporation  all references to epimmune are to epimmune inc  a majority owned subsidiary of cytel  until july   at which time cytel and epimmune merged  and all references to the we  us or our company are to the combined entity of cytel and epimmune 
on july   we completed a series of transactions the exchange transactions in which we i transferred all of the outstanding shares of epimmune s series b preferred stock then held by cytel to gd searle co 
searle in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of cytel s series b preferred stock  ii issued  shares of cytel s series s preferred stock and  shares of cytel s series s preferred stock to searle in exchange for all outstanding shares of epimmune s series b preferred stock and series b preferred stock and iii issued a total of  shares of cytel s common stock to the holders of common stock of epimmune in exchange for all outstanding shares of epimmune s common stock 
the acquisition of the minority interest in epimmune  through the exchange transaction  was accounted for as a purchase 
we recorded the acquisition of the minority interest at the fair market value of the preferred and common stock issued  and determined that the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets of million was in process technology based on a discounted cash flow analysis of that technology 
the analysis  with a discount rate of  was based on estimated research and development costs for nine years and product revenues beginning in year six  after the assumed completion of clinical trials and product approval by the fda 
the analysis also considered milestone payments based on scientific accomplishments  and new collaborative revenues based on projected future collaboration agreements 
the value of the technology was charged to acquired in process technology because technological feasibility had not been achieved nor had alternative future uses for the technology been identified 
following the exchange transactions  cytel merged with epimmune and changed its name to epimmune inc as of december   searle owned of our outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding preferred stock 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic products 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have funded our research and development primarily from equity derived working capital and through strategic alliances with other companies 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in the first quarter of  cytel completed the sale of its glytec carbohydrate synthesis and manufacturing business resulting in net proceeds of approximately million see note in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  cytel announced the results from its cylexin phase ii iii clinical trial which indicated that cylexin  cytel s lead therapeutic compound  showed no benefit over the placebo 
accordingly  cytel terminated its therapeutic anti inflammatory business and  as a result  cytel recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter  which was subsequently reduced to million in the fourth quarter see note in the consolidated financial statements 
we are now focused exclusively on the development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion reflects historical financial information for both cytel and epimmune on a combined basis 
we have financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  two public common stock offerings  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues  certain asset divestitures and interest income 
through december  we had raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments increased to million as compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to private placement proceeds of million and the release of million from escrow under the cytel agreement with neose  partially offset by cash used for our operations 
we expect to continue to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our ongoing vaccine research programs 
we had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  for the year ended december   our capital expenditures totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures for were primarily for laboratory equipment 
capital expenditures made in were primarily for equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements for our new laboratory and office facility  which was completed in april future capital expenditures will be in support of our vaccine business 
we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
during we made payments under the notes payable of million  primarily for laboratory equipment compared to payments of million during  primarily related to research and office facilities 
payments related to capitalized patent expenses for were million compared to million during the decrease is primarily attributable to the timing and nature of the filings made 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenditures in connection with our ongoing vaccine research programs  including costs related to preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  as well as marketing and distribution expenses 
it is our intention to seek collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that any agreements that may result from these discussions will successfully reduce our funding requirements or will not be terminated 
for example  pharmacia has decided to end our collaboration in the cancer field 
we will require additional equity or debt financing in order to pursue our research and development programs  and there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our drug discovery or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would not otherwise relinquish 
we anticipate that our existing resources will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through the end of the estimate for the period for which we anticipate our existing resources to enable us to maintain our current and planned operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties as set forth herein 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing research relationships  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of our drug discovery programs  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  our commercial success will depend in part on neither infringing patents issued to competitors nor breaching the technology licenses upon which our products might be based 
our business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with our ability to enter new collaborations  and the lengthy regulatory approval process and with potential competition from other products 
even if our products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to our inability to fund clinical development of such products  or the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market 
results of operations we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased in from  due primarily to lack of research revenues and milestone payments received from our collaborative agreement with pharmacia in compared to total revenues increased in from  due to research revenues and milestone payments received from pharmacia 
included in total revenues were research grant revenues of million in  million in  and million in as a result of the termination of our collaborative agreement with pharmacia  we do not expect to receive further revenues from pharmacia 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the discontinuation of cytel operations during the first quarter of research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to the discontinuation of research efforts on cylexin and other cytel technologies 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a million decrease from the million in general and administrative expenses in the decrease relates to the discontinuation of cytel s operations during partially offset by increased staffing and associated expenses for business development  financial and administrative activities during after discontinuation of cytel s operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in due primarily to termination of cytel operations 
we had a reduction in restructuring charges of million in compared to million in restructuring charges in related to the termination of non epimmune operations 
we had no charges to write off of in process technology in in  we charged million to operations for the write off of in process technology related to the acquisition of the minority interest in epimmune 
the charge was based on a discounted cash flow analysis prepared to determine the fair value of the excess of purchase price over the identifiable assets recorded as a result of the merger of cytel and epimmune 
we had no minority interest in our company during the period and had a minority interest in the net loss of a consolidated subsidiary of million during the period 
other income was million in compared to million in the amount represents a payment from elan of million related to the assignment of a license and the release of million from escrow under the neose agreement 
the amount relates primarily to million from elan international services in consideration for the buyout of certain future milestone obligations by elan 
there was no material gain on the disposal of assets during the period compared to a million gain on disposal of assets in related to the sale of cytel s glytec carbohydrate synthesis and manufacturing business  offset by the write off of leasehold improvements of million 
net interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in from was due to higher average cash balances during the period 
the decrease in from was due to lower average cash balances during the period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
