new accounting standards not yet adopted in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and establishes criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but  instead  tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of the statement 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective july   which had no effect on its financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company beginning october   at which time the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of its intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and make any necessary amortization adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the statement 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
amortization expense related to goodwill was  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
 the company has not yet been able to assess the impact of adopting this statement on its financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill

the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on october  management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no

foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
japanese sourced products denominated in japanese yen accounted for approximately and of product purchases in fiscal and  respectively 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on these purchases through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
sales by the company s uk based subsidiary to customers in europe and the middle east are made in pounds sterling or euros 
in fiscal  approximately million of products were sold by the company to its uk based subsidiary for resale 
since the third quarter of fiscal  the pound and the euro have significantly weakened against the us dollar  thus increasing the cost of us sourced product sold by this subsidiary 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on intercompany sales through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and the effect of adoption was not material 
as of september   the company had interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively  whose aggregate fair value was a liability of approximately  in general  the company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate exposures

the company has a policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency activity  note derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments to the accompanying financial statements 
at september   the company s foreign currency exchange risks included a million intercompany accounts receivable balance due from the company s uk based subsidiary and a nominal japanese yen denominated trade accounts payable liability due to inventory suppliers 
such assets and liabilities are short term and will be settled in fiscal the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at september   a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound would result in a  decrease or increase  respectively  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance 
such foreign currency exchange risk at september  has been substantially hedged by forward exchange contracts 
at september   the company had million of outstanding floating rate bank debt which was covered by interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the foregoing floating rate debt to stated fixed rates see note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
thus  the company has substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments 
however  the company had approximately million of floating rate bank debt that is subject to interest rate risk as it was not covered by interest rate swap agreements 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has been minimal in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low 
however  inflation continues to increase costs to the company 
as operating expenses and production costs increase  the company seeks price increases to its customers to the extent permitted by market conditions
