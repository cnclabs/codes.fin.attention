item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide broadband wireless internet and wireless subscription television services using up to mhz of radio spectrum licensed by the fcc in the ghz and ghz range  primarily in medium and small markets across texas and the midwestern united states 
we own the bta authorization  or otherwise license or lease mds mmds itfs spectrum  in markets covering an estimated million total households  including three markets covering an estimated  total households for which we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 
on average  we own or lease mhz of spectrum per market 
our long term business strategy is to provide broadband wireless services using our high capacity radio spectrum in medium and small markets 
as of february   we provide always on  high speed wireless internet access service under temporary developmental fcc licenses to over accounts serving an estimated  end users in austin and sherman denison  texas 
these end users primarily are medium sized and small businesses  sohos and telecommuters 
our service offerings include internet access from kbps to mbps  or up to times faster than service provided over standard dial up telephone lines 
through two national independent contractors  we also provide value added services such as technical support  e mail  web hosting and design  and domain name service 
in february  we announced a strategic alliance and agreement with cisco to pursue testing of broadband wireless services using vofdm technology 
the tests include two field trials in austin and amarillo  texas 
we successfully completed the initial phase of the austin field trial in august  and expect to complete the amarillo field trial in the second quarter of because the trial was extended beyond certain dates in the original agreement with cisco  our prior purchase commitment of million in equipment has expired 
we currently are in discussions with cisco regarding new purchase commitments and equipment financing proposals 
although we currently intend to complete our technology trial in amarillo  there can be no assurance that the trial will be successful or that we will enter into a subsequent purchase or financing agreement with cisco 
in august  we filed over applications with the fcc to provide digital two way communications services in of our markets 
all such applications must meet fcc interference protection rules or contain the consent of co channel and adjacent channel licensees in our markets and neighboring markets 
the fcc issued a public notice accepting these and other applicants filings on february  all applications that have not been opposed within days after the issuance of this public notice will be deemed granted 
although we believe we will receive two way authorizations to replace our developmental authorizations in austin and sherman denison  there can be no assurance that we will receive such authorizations in these or other markets 
historically  we have used our spectrum to provide wireless subscription television services 
we presently have wireless subscription television transmission facilities constructed and operating in markets in nine states 
at february   we had approximately  wireless subscription television customers  including approximately  customers who subscribed only to programming service provided over our mmds spectrum  and  combo subscribers who subscribed to both our mds mmds itfs programming service and to directv programming service sold by us 
in addition  at february   there were approximately  customers who received only directv programming sold by us 
our business strategy contemplates a decline in wireless subscription television subscribers  revenues and ebitda in and beyond  as we allocate more of our spectrum and other resources to develop our broadband wireless internet access and other broadband wireless internet protocol ip based businesses 
reorganization 
on the april   effective date  we consummated our plan to convert  among other things  approximately million of senior and subordinated debt and accrued interest into common stock 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting  financial information in the consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for the year ended december  and the period from the effective date to december  the successor period  is presented on a different basis than the financial information as of december   for the year ended december   and for the period january   to the effective date collectively  the predecessor period 
accordingly  such information is not comparable 
the predecessor period includes operations through march   plus the gain on debt forgiveness recognized on the effective date 
the successor period includes operations from the effective date through december  see reorganization in item revenues 
our revenues currently consist primarily of monthly fees paid by wireless cable subscribers for basic programming  premium programming  equipment rental  and other miscellaneous fees  as well as fees generated from start up internet operations in austin and sherman denison  texas 
unless the context requires otherwise  all references to subscribers or systems are to our wireless cable subscribers and systems because revenues and subscribers from our internet business were immaterial in system operations expenses 
system operations expenses include channel lease payments  wireless cable programming costs  labor  and overhead  and costs related to service calls and disconnects  transmitter site and tower rentals  and certain repairs and maintenance expenditures 
programming costs  with the exception of minimum payments  channel lease payments  and repairs and maintenance  are variable expenses based on the number of subscribers 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses include office and administrative costs of operating our subscription television markets and our two internet markets  as well as sales and marketing and bad debt expenses related to these operations and corporate costs directly and indirectly allocated to these operations 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of systems and equipment and capitalized installation costs  amortization of license and leased license investment  and amortization of the subscriber value and excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
our policy is to capitalize the excess of direct costs of subscriber installations over installation fees 
these direct costs include reception materials and equipment on subscriber premises and installation labor 
these direct costs are capitalized as systems and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
ebitda 
ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non recurring items  is widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in the internet  cable television and telecommunication industries 
ebitda is also widely accepted as a financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda is not a financial measure determined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results or to cash flows as a measure of funds available for discretionary or other liquidity purposes 
ebitda may not be comparably calculated from one company to another 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table summarizes the operating results for the year ended december   in comparison to the years ended december  and  combining the results for the predecessor period january   through the effective date with the successor period the effective date through december  
the most significant impact of the plan was a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the write down of certain long lived assets to estimated fair value  a decrease in interest expense due to the extinguishment of certain liabilities subject to compromise  and a one time  nonrecurring gain on extinguishment of liabilities subject to compromise 
specific trends addressed within the discussion of operating results will refer to the combined results as presented in this table in thousands  unless otherwise noted years ended december  revenues    systems operations expense    system operations expense percent of revenue selling  general and administrative expense    selling  general and administrative expense percent of revenue depreciation and amortization    interest income    interest expense    equity in losses of affiliates  other income expense  reorganization costs   net cash provided by used in operating activities 
   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities  revenues 
our revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease from to and a decrease from to the average number of wireless subscription television subscribers for the year ended december   was  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended december  and  we had  and  average subscribers  respectively  who received only directv programming sold by us 
beginning in january  we did not include these customers in our reported wireless subscription television subscriber base but we do receive certain agency revenue from directv related to these accounts  as well as equipment lease payments from a portion of these customers 
we also do not include these customers or their related revenues in our calculation of recurring average revenue per subscriber 
prior year calculations have been revised to conform with this presentation 
the decline in revenues from to was primarily due to fewer total subscription television subscribers resulting from o decreased sales and marketing as we continued to shift our principal business focus from subscription television service to testing and developing our broadband wireless ip based services  o the suspension  in seven markets in march  of our offer of video programming provided solely over mmds frequencies in anticipation of transitioning this spectrum to internet services  o our first system wide price increase in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in increased disconnects by video subscribers in  and o loss of subscribers in austin in the second quarter of as a result of a technology conversion that caused some existing subscribers to fall outside of the coverage range of the new technology 
this decline was partially offset by additional revenues recognized from our agency relationships with directv and its distributors 
average monthly recurring revenue per subscriber was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase over these periods is due to overall higher priced packages being purchased by our subscribers  including increased purchases of premium programming 
we expect revenues and video subscribers to continue to decline in as we continue to transition our business from subscription television to broadband wireless internet and other ip based services 
we do not expect the decline to be offset materially by an increase in revenues from our internet business in  as we do not expect to complete field trials for our new internet services technology platform until the second quarter of we are continuing to evaluate our deployment schedule and intend to finalize the schedule after our technology trial with cisco is completed 
we currently do not expect the number of new markets that we will launch in  if any  will be material 
system operations expense 
system operations expenses were million in  million in  and million in as a percentage of revenues  system operations expenses were in  in and in the decrease in system operations expense over the periods presented  including the decrease as a percent of revenues from to  was primarily due to lower service call expense and programming expense as a result of lower subscriber count and a larger proportion of directv subscribers  which have lower programming costs 
system operations expense as a percent of revenue was higher in compared to due to higher costs under certain spectrum leases that were renegotiated in preparation for providing two way broadband wireless services 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense was million in  million in and million in as a percent of revenues  sg a expense was for  for and for sg a expense decreased annually from to due to savings from the consolidation of certain offices and management in our subscription television markets  lower bad debt expense due to improved collections and lower subscription television marketing expenses 
these costs were partially offset by increased costs related to our broadband wireless internet business and increased costs to improve service at our customer care center 
internet sg a costs  which include i costs related to the development of broadband wireless internet access and other ip based services  ii costs related to our two operating internet markets in austin and sherman denison  texas  and iii allocable corporate overhead  were million in and million in the increase in internet sg a expense from to was primarily due to increased costs for technology trials and for building the field and corporate organizations to develop and support the internet business  as well as an increase in the allocation to internet of existing corporate resources 
excluding internet costs and revenues  sg a would have been of revenues for and of revenues for depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from to was primarily due to a larger number of disconnected mmds subscribers 
when subscribers are disconnected  the remaining balance of non recoverable equipment related to the installation of that subscriber is written off to depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from to was due to a write down of certain long lived assets to estimated fair market value during in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
impairment of long lived assets 
we continually review components of our business for possible impairment of assets based on  among other things  changes in technology  competition  consumer habits  and business climate 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting for impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of and certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets  provides guidelines for recognizing and measuring impairment losses  and requires that the carrying amount of impaired assets be reduced to estimated fair value 
during the second quarter of  we reviewed the assets associated with certain undeveloped markets and concluded that o cash flows from operations would not be adequate to fund the capital outlay required to build out such markets  and o because of our default on our interest payment on the old notes in the second quarter of  outside financing for the build out of these markets was not readily available prior to the consummation of a financial restructuring 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 the channel licenses and leases in these undeveloped markets were individually evaluated and written down to estimated fair value  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million in the second quarter of throughout the second and third quarters of  we analyzed various recapitalization and restructuring alternatives with the assistance of our financial advisors  wasserstein perella and co  inc  including consensual  out of court alternatives 
in october  we announced that we intended to pursue a prenegotiated plan of reorganization by filing a voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
this event caused us to evaluate all of our long lived assets for impairment  according to the requirements of sfas no 
and to write those assets down to fair market value 
we retained the services of another third party to assist in performing the allocation of fair market value 
this resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million for the third quarter of the impairment included write downs of systems and equipment in the amount of million  license and leased license investment in the amount of million and the excess of cost over fair value in the amount of million 
operating loss 
we generated operating losses of million in  million in and million in the increased losses from to were primarily due to lower wireless subscription television revenues  additional expenditures related to testing and development of broadband wireless services  and increased depreciation related to a larger number of disconnects in these cost increases were partially offset by lower programming expense  savings from consolidation of certain offices and management in our subscription television markets  lower subscription television marketing costs  and lower bad debt expense 
excluding the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair market value in the second and third quarters of  operating loss for the year ended december   was million reflecting an improvement of million in compared to this was primarily due to lower programming costs  decreased subscription television marketing expenses  savings from consolidation of certain markets  and lower depreciation expense resulting from the write down of long lived assets during ebitda 
excluding non recurring items  ebitda was a negative  for the year ended december  compared to a positive million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in ebitda from to was primarily due to decreased subscription television revenues resulting from fewer subscribers as we continue to shift our principal focus to developing our broadband wireless ip based services  and from start up and sg a costs related to our broadband wireless internet operations 
ebitda increased from to due to lower programming costs  decreased subscription television marketing expense and savings from consolidation of certain markets 
we expect ebitda to further decline in as we continue to transition our business from subscription television to development of our broadband wireless internet and other ip based services 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income from to was due to higher earnings during the current year on larger unrestricted cash balances 
the decrease in interest income from to was due to higher interest earnings in the first quarter of on larger escrowed balances segregated for the payment of interest on the old senior notes  which was paid in april  combined with lower overall cash balances in due to payment of reorganization costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense increased slightly from to because of higher debt balances related to capital lease obligations incurred in connection with the sale and leaseback of tower sites that were sold during the fourth quarter of and the first nine months of interest expense decreased from to because we discontinued the accrual of interest and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs on our old senior notes and old convertible notes upon filing the voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on december  see reorganization in item if interest had continued to be accrued  total interest expense would have been million for the period from january   through the effective date 
equity in losses of affiliates 
we had no equity in losses of affiliates for the year ended december  or  compared to losses of million during the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of wireless one  inc wireless one and at december   we also owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of cs wireless 
losses recorded in prior years for wireless one reduced our investment balance to zero in november  although we still owned approximately of the outstanding common stock 
during the first and third quarters of  we received million and  respectively  in exchange for our equity interest in wireless one  inc wireless one  which announced confirmation of its plan of reorganization in november these proceeds were recorded as a gain and are reflected in other income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we wrote off million of our excess cost in cs wireless and our remaining investment balance of million based on losses incurred by cs wireless 
in december  we sold our equity interest in cs wireless to cai wireless systems  inc accordingly  no losses from affiliates were recorded in the year ended december  or other income expense 
during the first and third quarters of  we received million and  respectively  in exchange for our equity interest in wireless one described above 
the entire amount was recognized as other income  as our investment balance had been reduced to zero 
other income during also includes the recognition of a deferred gain on the sale and leaseback of of our towers during and other income in consists primarily of cash settlements from certain litigation matters 
income tax benefit 
federal income tax law related to reorganizations generally requires that the amount of income from discharge of indebtedness that occurs in connection with a chapter bankruptcy be used to reduce federal tax attributes 
generally  the reduction is applied to reduce net operating loss carryforwards  followed by other tax attributes including the basis of certain assets and the tax basis of subsidiary stock tax attribute reduction 
an election exists to reduce the basis of depreciable assets first  which can be favorable under certain circumstances 
management elected to apply the required reduction first to tax basis in depreciable assets  and then to net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of reduction in depreciable assets was approximately million 
the amount of reduction in net operating loss carryforwards was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
no income tax benefit was recorded for the years ended december   and see md a effects of reorganization 
reorganization costs 
during each of the years ended december  and  we incurred million in expenses related to our reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
these costs were for financial and legal advisors  accountants and administrative costs 
see reorganization in item there were no reorganization costs in gain on debt forgiveness 
in connection with our reorganization under chapter  on the april  effective date of our reorganization  we recorded an extraordinary gain of approximately million reflecting the extinguishment of certain liabilities subject to compromise in exchange for common stock and warrants 
upon consummation of our plan on april   our old senior notes and old convertible notes totaling approximately million  including the interest accrued thereon and associated unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs  were canceled and exchanged for million shares of newly issued common stock and warrants to acquire  shares of common stock  with a combined estimated fair value of million as of the effective date 
this extraordinary gain is not taxable to us pursuant to federal income tax law because it arose in connection with our recapitalization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
it does  however  result in a permanent tax attribute reduction 
see md a effects of reorganization 
net loss 
we have recorded net losses since our inception 
our net loss in was million 
excluding the extraordinary gain on debt forgiveness discussed above  we incurred a net loss of million for the period from january   to the effective date and a net loss of million for the period from the effective date to december  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
the improvement in annual net loss from to excluding impairment charges of million in resulted from o lower video programming costs related to fewer subscribers  o lower interest expense due to the cancellation of approximately million in debt in our financial restructuring  slightly offset by added interest on capital lease obligations related to the sale and leaseback of our towers  o cost savings from consolidation of certain market offices and management  o a gain of million during on the exchange of our equity interest in wireless one and on the sale and leaseback of our towers  o decreased subscription television marketing expenses  and o no reorganization costs in compared to million in and million in loss per share for the year ended december   and for the period from the effective date to december   was and  respectively 
earnings per share information has not been presented for the predecessor period as nucentrix was recapitalized on the effective date in connection with our plan and  accordingly  per share amounts are not comparable between the predecessor period and the successor period 
balance sheet as of december   compared to the balance sheet as of december  on april   the plan became effective and we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value and beginning retained earnings set to zero 
liabilities subject to compromise were adjusted to zero in the debt discharge portion of the fresh start reporting 
all outstanding common stock  stock options and warrants were canceled and new common stock and warrants were issued 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
other material changes to balance sheet accounts from to were as follows o the decrease in subscriber receivables resulted primarily from a decrease of  average subscription television subscribers  o the increase in prepaid expenses and other is due to a reclassification from a long term to a current asset of the portion of the capitalized customer acquisition costs associated with directv customers that are being amortized to sales and marketing expense during the current year  and o the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to the settlement of certain tax and programming audits in the current year  lower deferred revenue related to our agency relationship with directv and payment of accrued chapter expenses in the current year 
changes in method for reporting subscribers periodically  we may implement price increases or create new program offerings that upgrade our basic program price structure 
upon such occurrence  we also may update our methodology for reporting subscribers in mdus who are billed in bulk to the mdu owner 
these bulk mdu subscribers are converted to sfu subscribers for reporting purposes using an equivalent basic unit ebu rate that corresponds to our most utilized current pricing tier for basic programming for sfu subscribers 
this rate is divided into the total revenue from bulk subscribers to get an equivalent number of subscribers for reporting purposes 
consequently  when this rate is increased  the number of equivalent subscribers will change and normally decrease 
the following ebu rate revisions occurred during the periods presented herein o effective march   our ebu rate was increased to  resulting in a decrease of approximately  reported subscribers  and o effective november   the ebu rate was increased to  resulting in a decrease of approximately reported subscribers 
liquidity and capital resources the broadband wireless business is capital intensive 
since inception  we have spent funds to lease or otherwise acquire mmds channel rights in various markets and operating systems  to construct operating systems  and to finance initial system operating losses 
our primary sources of capital have been subscription fees  debt financing  the sale of common stock  and the sale of mmds channel rights that were not essential to our business strategy 
the approval by the fcc of the use of mmds spectrum for digital two way communications services allows us to use our spectrum to provide broadband wireless services such as high speed internet access services  voice over ip and wireless telecommunications services 
the growth of our business by using our spectrum to provide two way communications services will require substantial investment in capital expenditures for the development and launch of broadband wireless services 
cash used in operations was million during the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operations of million during the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from current year recognition of deferred agency revenue received in the prior year from our alliance with directv and its distributors  and from payment of previously accrued reorganization costs 
cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we paid million in interest on our old senior notes 
no interest was paid on the old senior notes after that time  as we discontinued accruing interest on these notes when we filed our bankruptcy petition on december  the debt was discharged effective april   upon confirmation of our plan 
cash used in investing activities principally relates to the construction of additional operating systems  the acquisition and installation of subscriber equipment  the upgrade of transmission equipment in certain markets  and the acquisition of wireless cable channel rights and operating systems  partially offset by the sale of mmds channel rights that are not a part of our strategic plan 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in cash used in investing activities decreased from to primarily due to million received in the first nine months of from the exchange of our equity interest in wireless one 
in addition  we had lower expenditures for systems and equipment related to our subscription television business  somewhat offset by higher expenditures for engineering  legal  site acquisition  and other costs related to the preparation of fcc applications necessary to provide two way communications services 
the increase in cash used in investing activities from to resulted from million received in from the sale of debt securities held in our escrow account for payment of interest on our old senior notes 
this was partially offset in by proceeds from the sale and lease back of communications towers for approximately million 
cash used in financing activities was  during compared to  during and million during cash used by financing activities during included principal payments on our bta debt and on capital leases related to the sale and leaseback of of our communications towers including towers sold in the fourth quarter of and four towers sold in the first three quarters of 
this was partially offset by million in cash proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash used during was for principal payments on our bta debt  capital lease obligations and other notes payable  several of which have been fully repaid  offset by million in cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
cash used during was primarily for principal payments on obligations related to capital leases and various prior period cable system acquisitions 
at february   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and  in restricted cash representing collateral securing various outstanding letters of credit to certain of our vendors 
future cash requirements our goal is to become a leading provider of broadband wireless services in our markets 
to implement our long term business strategy we intend to first offer high speed internet access service to medium sized and small businesses  sohos  telecommuters  and residential consumers in our markets  and later offer telephony services  including wireless telecommunications and voice over ip services 
we estimate that a launch of a new broadband wireless system providing high speed internet access in a typical market will involve an initial expenditure of approximately  to  for network equipment  depending upon the system design and type and sophistication of the equipment 
in addition  we estimate that the acquisition and installation of each new internet subscriber will cost between  and  depending upon the type of customer 
this includes charges for equipment  labor and direct commissions 
this may be offset partially by installation and other up front fees 
other launch costs include the cost of securing adequate space for marketing facilities in markets not previously operating a wireless subscription television business  as well as costs related to employees 
as a result of these costs  operating losses are likely to be incurred by a system during the start up period 
we believe that additional capital will be required to fully implement our long term business strategy of providing broadband wireless service in medium and small markets 
however  until such additional capital becomes available on acceptable terms  we have implemented a plan to maximize cash resources and reduce expenditures in as we announced in february  we have reduced the number of markets in which we intend to launch broadband wireless internet service in in addition  we announced in march that we had reduced our work force by employees  or approximately 
the reduction in force primarily was related to internet sales  marketing and support 
we are continuing to evaluate the development of technology by cisco and other vendors for mmds service  as well as the capital markets and other sources of financing 
however  until we are able to deploy a cost effective and reliable technology platform  and have obtained financing on satisfactory terms and conditions  we intend to continue to look for efficiencies  maximize our cash resources and preserve our spectrum resources 
this may result in deployment of no new internet markets in we expect that under this plan  cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund operations in the normal course of business at least through the second quarter of we are continuing to evaluate our near and long term capital needs  and likely will seek additional capital in options for raising additional capital include the sale of debt or equity securities  borrowings under secured or unsecured loan arrangements  including vendor equipment financing  and sales of assets 
we can provide no assurance that such capital or financing will be available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms 
effects of reorganization our company and certain of our subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
subsidiaries in which we own less than of the voting stock will file separate federal income tax returns 
we have had no material state or federal income tax expense since inception 
as of december  and before taking into consideration the effects of the reorganization  we had approximately million in net operating losses for us federal income tax purposes  expiring in years through we estimate that approximately million of the above losses relate to various acquisitions and as such are subject to certain limitations 
federal income tax law generally requires that the amount of income from discharge of indebtedness that occurs in connection with a chapter bankruptcy be used to reduce federal tax attributes 
generally  the reduction is applied to reduce net operating loss carryforwards  followed by other tax attributes including the basis of certain assets and the tax basis of subsidiary stock tax attribute reduction 
an election exists to reduce the basis of depreciable assets first  which can be favorable under certain circumstances 
management has elected to apply the required reduction first to tax basis in depreciable assets  and then to net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of reduction in the tax basis of depreciable assets was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining basis in depreciable assets 
the amount of reduction in net operating loss carryforwards was approximately million  leaving approximately million in remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition to the permanent tax attribute reduction  we also must limit the annual deduction of pre bankruptcy net operating losses and built in deductions to an amount no greater than the fair market value of nucentrix immediately after the reorganization  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the annual limitation applicable to our pre bankruptcy net operating losses and built in deductions is currently estimated to be approximately million 
we adopted fresh start reporting on the april   effective date of our plan in accordance with sop fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value and beginning retained earnings set to zero 
liabilities subject to compromise also were adjusted to zero in the debt discharge portion of the fresh start reporting entry 
in addition  on the effective date our outstanding common stock was canceled and newly issued shares of common stock and warrants were distributed to certain creditors in satisfaction of their claims against us 
in connection with the debt discharge  nucentrix recorded an extraordinary gain of approximately million 
commitments and contingencies certain of our former directors and officers  to whom we may have indemnity obligations  are defendants in a purported class action securities lawsuit in state district court in kleberg county  texas 
this action alleges  among other things  various violations of state securities laws 
a second securities lawsuit against former directors and officers of nucentrix was dismissed with prejudice in june by the us district court for the northern district of texas  although the plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
in addition  several former directors and officers to whom we may have indemnity obligations are defendants in a purported class action lawsuit filed on behalf of former stockholders of heartland  alleging that the defendants purposely undervalued our enterprise value as part of our plan confirmation process in order to extinguish prepetition equity holders interests 
we also are a party to several purported class action lawsuits alleging that we overcharged our customers for administrative late fees  including one administrative late fee lawsuit alleging violation of the federal rico act 
we intend to vigorously defend the above matters 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of these proceedings or to estimate the amounts or potential range of loss with respect to these matters  and while we do not expect such an adverse outcome  we believe that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings that exceeds or otherwise is excluded from applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
in september  two former stockholders of heartland filed a motion in us bankruptcy court to revoke the order confirming our plan which became effective in april we intend to vigorously oppose the motion  and it is not possible at this time to predict the effect of any action by the bankruptcy court to revoke the plan 
for a more detailed discussion of legal matters  see item  legal proceedings 
as discussed in item  business spectrum allocation proceedings  the fcc and other government organizations have initiated proceedings to study  identify and authorize additional radio frequencies for third generation  or g  mobile wireless services worldwide 
several frequency bands are being studied in this process 
one of the frequency bands under consideration for such services is mhz  in which we hold substantially all of our mds mmds itfs fixed wireless fcc licenses and spectrum leases 
we intend to vigorously oppose any effort to share or reallocate any of our spectrum for g services 
however  we cannot predict how these various proceedings will be resolved 
we could be required to share part or all of these frequencies with g mobile services  or relocate part or all of our fixed wireless services to another frequency band 
although the ntia plan to select spectrum recognizes that additional spectrum may have to be found or other accommodations will have to be made for relocated licensees to continue their operations  it is impossible to determine at this time exactly what impact  if any  spectrum sharing or relocation would have on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  sharing our spectrum with g services  or relocating part or all of our fixed wireless services to another frequency band  could require new or additional equipment and raise our operating costs  delay the provision of service and or render our services uneconomic in certain areas

finally  the dol alleges that nucentrix failed to timely distribute certain vested company contributions of heartland common stock after we suspended these contributions in october we are investigating this matter to determine what  if any  corrective actions may be necessary to address these allegations  and cannot at this time predict with any certainty any monetary obligations that we may incur with respect to this matter 
however  we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

recently issued accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  which requires that all derivatives be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
sfas is now effective for all fiscal quarters and for all fiscal years beginning after december  we expect that the adoption of sfas will not have an impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition and accounting for deferred costs in the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which mainly consist of commercial paper 
at december   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately  with an overall weighted average return of approximately and an overall weighted average life of less than year 
the marketable securities held by us have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of december  the fair value of our long term debt at december   is estimated to be million based on the overall rate of the long term debt of and an overall maturity of six years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are not currently evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we do not currently have any exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
all business transactions are in us dollars
