item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in  the company has been primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of products based on the company s three proprietary development platforms gene activated r proteins  niche protein tm products and gene therapy 
as of december   no revenue has been derived from the sale of any products 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will increase substantially in future years as product development efforts accelerate 
with the exception of  the company has incurred substantial annual operating losses since inception and expects to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  as a result  the company is dependent upon existing cash resources  interest income  external financing from equity offerings  debt financings or collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance its operations 
results of operations may vary significantly from period to period depending on  among other factors  the progress of the company s research and development efforts  the receipt  if any  of additional license fees and milestone payments  the timing of certain expenses  and the establishment of additional collaborative research agreements 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
results of operations years ended december   and license and research revenues totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all revenues were earned from collaborative agreements with aventis pharma aventis  genetics institute  inc and sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
research and development expenses totaled  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in of  or  and in of  or  was principally due to increases in external development services and research and development staffing in each of the company s product development platforms 
in particular  preclinical and clinical costs for the company s fabry disease  hunter syndrome and hemophilia a programs  as well as manufacturing costs associated with the fabry disease program  were significant components of the increase in during  the costs related to both preclinical and clinical programs are expected to increase significantly as product development activities are initiated or expanded 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increases in of  or  and in of  or  were principally due to costs in building a business development and commercialization infrastructure  particularly sales and marketing capabilities related to the commercialization of products in the company s niche protein product platform in both the us and europe 
during  these costs are expected to increase as pre launch activities related to its niche protein product platform accelerate 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in is due to both higher average investment balances for as compared to and higher rates of return earned in the decrease in interest income in is due to both lower average investment balances and generally lower rates of return earned in the company had a net loss of   and  in  and  respectively 
liquidity and sources of capital since its inception  the company has financed its operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  borrowings under debt agreements  revenues from collaborative agreements and interest income 
the company had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  at december  cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in us government and agency obligations and money market funds 
in june  the company completed a private placement of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately  in november  the company completed a private placement of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately  the company leased additional facilities in the fourth quarter of which are used for research and development 
in december  the company obtained an unsecured term loan facility for up to  to finance the capital costs related to the leased space 
the loan became payable in december on the basis of a seven year amortization schedule over a five year period  with a final payment for any remaining amount in september the loan bears interest at either the prime rate or libor plus  at the company s election 
the weighted average interest rate of the loan at december  was 
the note contains certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  minimum cash and tangible net asset requirements and prohibitions on the payment of dividends 
at december    was outstanding under this facility 
in august  the company entered into a ten year lease for a new corporate headquarters and research and development facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
the lease requires a security deposit of  of which  was paid in cash and the balance provided in the form of a letter of credit 
an investment with a value of  collateralizes the letter of credit 
the company expects to spend up to an additional  for leasehold improvements for this facility 
in january  the company purchased a  square foot development facility for  in addition  it leased an adjoining  square foot facility under the terms of a ten year lease 
the company expects to spend up to an additional  for leasehold improvements for these facilities 
the company may seek financing for all or a significant portion of the cost of the leasehold improvements described above 
there can be no guarantee that financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
at december   the company had committed to pay approximately  to third parties for certain product development activities through in may  the company and aventis entered into an agreement to commercialize dynepo tm  a gene activated erythropoeitin product 
under the terms of the agreement  aventis is obligated to pay the company a total of  upon completion of all milestones and objectives set forth in the agreement 
as of december   the company had received  the remaining  in payments are contingent upon aventis achievement of certain dynepo clinical development milestones 
aventis is responsible for the worldwide development  manufacturing and marketing of dynepo  and the company is entitled to receive a royalty based on net sales 
in march  the company entered into a second agreement with aventis to commercialize a second gene activated protein  ga ii 
in december  tkt reacquired worldwide commercial rights to ga ii 
the ga ii development program has concluded phase i studies  and the company may fund the remaining development cost itself 
this cost could be significant 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various times through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of loss carryforwards and tax credits  the company has fully reserved against any potential tax benefit 
the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to limitation under the changes in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
because of this limitation  it is possible that taxable income in future years  which would otherwise be offset by net operating losses  will not be offset and  therefore  will be subject to tax 
substantial additional funds will be required to support the company s research and development programs  for acquisition of technologies  for preclinical and clinical testing of its products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  expansion of laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  establishment of sales and marketing capabilities and for general and administrative expenses 
until such time  if any  as the company s operations generate significant revenues from product sales  cash resources  interest income and proceeds from equity offerings  debt financings and funding from collaborative arrangements will be required to fund operations 
the company expects to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through equity financings  debt financings  lease arrangements related to facilities and capital equipment and collaborative research agreements 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on the company s continued progress in its exploratory  preclinical and clinical development programs 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with revenues from collaborative agreements and interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations into the company s cash requirements may vary  however  depending on numerous factors 
lack of necessary funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and product development programs or to license its potential products or technologies to third parties 
the company has been engaged in litigation with amgen inc and kirin amgen  inc with respect to the development of dynepo and with genzyme corporation with respect to the development of replagal 
pursuant to the amended and restated license agreement  dated march  by and between aventis and the company  aventis has assumed the legal cost of the amgen and kirin amgen litigations 
the company is required to reimburse aventis for the company s share of litigation expenses  as defined  from future royalties  if any  received from the sale of dynepo and in certain other circumstances 
forward looking statements statements that are not historical facts  including statements about the company s confidence and strategies and its expectations about future products  technologies and opportunities  market demand or acceptance of future products are forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  estimates  intends  should  could  will  may  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these include  without limitation  the following whether any of the company s gene activated protein  niche protein or gene therapy product candidates will advance in the clinical trial process  whether such clinical trials will proceed in a timely manner  whether the clinical trial results will warrant continued product development  whether the required regulatory filings  such as investigational new drug applications and biologics license applications  are made in a timely manner  whether the company s products will receive approval from the us food and drug administration or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies  if such products receive approval  whether they will be successfully distributed and marketed  whether patent litigation in which the company is involved or may become involved are resolved in a manner adverse to the company  the effects of competitive products on the company s proposed products  the company s dependence on third parties  including collaborators  manufacturers and distributors  and the other risks set forth below the caption  certain factors that may affect future results

while the company may elect to update forward looking statements at some point in the future  the company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so  even if its estimates change 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we are a party to litigation with amgen and kirin amgen involving dynepo tm in april  amgen commenced a patent infringement action against the company and hoechst marion roussel  inc now aventis pharma in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
amgen s complaint  as subsequently amended  sought a declaratory judgment that our dynepo tm product  and the cells and processes used to make dynepo  infringe  and will infringe  amgen s us patent nos 
    and a non jury trial commenced in may and concluded in september in january  the court ruled that we do not infringe the asserted claims of us patent no 
 and  if this finding is in error  that the asserted claims are invalid  that we do not infringe the asserted claims of us patent  that claims  and of united states patent no 
 are valid  enforceable and are infringed by us under the doctrine of equivalents  that claims   and of united states patent no 
 are valid  enforceable and literally infringed by us  but that we do not infringe claim of the patent  and that claim of us patent no 
 is valid  enforceable and literally infringed by us 
amgen did not seek and was not awarded monetary damages 
in january  we filed a notice of appeal with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit from the judgment of the district court in this case 
we believe that we have strong grounds for appeal 
amgen filed a notice of cross appeal in february in addition  in july  together with aventis  we commenced legal proceedings in the united kingdom against kirin amgen  inc  seeking a declaration that a uk patent held by kirin amgen will not be infringed by our activities related to dynepo and that certain claims of kirin amgen s uk patent are invalid 
the trial commenced in january and concluded in march we expect a decision from the court in mid pursuant to an amended and restated license agreement  dated march  by and between aventis and the company  aventis has assumed the legal costs of the amgen and kirin amgen litigation 
we will reimburse aventis for the company s share of the litigation expenses  as defined  from future royalties  if any  received from the sale of dynepo and in certain other circumstances 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of either of these proceedings 
court decisions adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in particular  with respect to the amgen litigation  if the district court decision is not reversed on appeal  it is likely that we and aventis would be enjoined from making  using  or selling dynepo in the us additionally  dynepo may be the subject of additional litigation in the future 
we are a party to litigation with genzyme and mount sinai involving replagal tm we are a defendant in a civil patent infringement lawsuit brought by genzyme and mt 
sinai in the us district court for the district of delaware 
genzyme s complaint  which was filed in july  alleges that the manufacture  use  intended sale  and or intended offer for sale of our replagal tm product infringes us patent no 
 genzyme and mt 
sinai seek injunctive relief and an accounting for damages 
discovery proceedings commenced in february and the court has scheduled trial in this action to begin in march in september  we filed suit against genzyme and mt 
sinai in the us district court for the district of massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment that genzyme s us patent no 
 is invalid and not infringed us 
we expect the case to be transferred to the us district court for the district of delaware 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this litigation 
a court decision adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may not obtain government approvals  the approvals process is costly and lengthy the testing  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing  among other things  of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
the regulatory approval process to obtain market approval for a new drug or biologic takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
we have had only limited experience in preparing applications and obtaining regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that submission of an investigational new drug application will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials  or that once clinical trials have begun  testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period  if at all  with respect to any of our products 
furthermore  we or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
once trials are complete and an application has been submitted  the fdamay deny a bla if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  may require additional testing or information  or may require postmarketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources 
we can provide no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
in  the fda requested that additional data be provided regarding manufacturing information and that a new bla for dynepo be submitted when the data is compiled 
in  the fda issued a complete review letter regarding the replagal bla  which requested further explanation in several areas and additional data 
because gene therapy is a relatively new technology and products for gene therapy have not been extensively tested in humans  the regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products may be more uncertain than for other types of products 
this uncertainty may cause delays in the regulatory process relating to our gene therapy products  including delays in our initiating clinical trials of these products 
this uncertainty may also increase the cost of obtaining regulatory approvals of our gene therapy products 
both before and after approval is obtained  violations of regulatory requirements may result in various adverse consequences  including the fda s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market  or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or the bla holder 
we will also be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the sale of its products 
whether or not we have obtained fda approval  the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve a product prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
we announced in march that the cpmp issued a positive opinion recommending approval of replagal tm 
the cpmp s recommendation for approval will be forwarded to the ec  which will determine whether to grant marketing authorization of replagal in the european union 
the cpmp also issued a positive opinion recommending approval of genzyme s fabry disease product to the ec 
there can be no assurance that the ec will approve the marketing authorization for replagal 
competitors products may receive orphan drug exclusivity and thereby preclude us from marketing our niche protein tm products and we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our niche protein products some jurisdictions  including the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
generally  if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity  ie  other applications to market the same product for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of seven to ten years 
obtaining orphan drug designations and orphan drug exclusivity for our niche protein products may be critical to our success in this area 
we may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for any of our potential products or be able to maintain such designation or exclusivity for any of these products 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not apply to our product 
our competitors may also seek orphan drug designations and obtain orphan drug exclusivity for products competitive with our products before we obtain marketing approval 
we believe that genzyme is seeking marketing authorization in both the us and europe for a protein product for the treatment of fabry disease for which it has orphan drug designation 
in december  genzyme announced that the fda requested clarification of several points and identified additional data it needs concerning genzyme s bla 
concurrently with the issuance of its positive opinion on replagal to the ec  the cpmp issued a positive opinion recommending approval of genzyme s fabry disease product to the ec 
we cannot predict whether genzyme may in the future be able to prevent the marketing of replagal through an orphan drug statute 
we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing  or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do the biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities  and other research institutions 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do and are conducting extensive research and development activities on technologies and products similar to or competitive with ours 
we may be unable to develop technologies and products that are more clinically efficacious or cost effective than products developed by our competitors 
even if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  many of our competitors have more extensive and established sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities than we do 
litigation with third parties  including our litigation with both amgen and genzyme  could delay our time to market for certain products and enable our competitors to more quickly and effectively penetrate certain markets 
under our gene activated protein program  we are developing fully human versions of proteins that are currently marketed 
for instance  in the case of dynepo  erythropoietin is marketed by amgen and johnson johnson in the us  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
boehringer mannheim gmbh and johnson johnson janssen cilag in europe  and sankyo company ltd  chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd  and kirin in japan 
many of the protein products against which our gene activated proteins would compete have well known brand names  have been promoted extensively  and have achieved market acceptance by third party payors  hospitals  physicians  and patients 
many of the companies that produce these protein products have patents covering the techniques used to produce these products  which have served as effective barriers to entry in the protein therapeutics market 
as with amgen and its erythropoietin product  these companies may seek to block our entry into the market by asserting that our gene activated proteins infringe their patents 
many of these companies are also seeking to develop and commercialize new or potentially improved versions of their proteins 
we believe that the primary competition with respect to our niche protein product program is from biotechnology and smaller pharmaceutical companies 
in particular  we believe that our major competition with respect to fabry disease and gaucher disease is genzyme 
we believe that genzyme is seeking marketing authorization in both the us and europe 
genzyme has received orphan drug status for its fabry disease treatment in both the us and europe 
moreover  concurrently with the issuance of its positive opinion on replagal to the ec  the cpmp issued a positive opinion recommending approval of genzyme s fabry disease product to the ec 
in addition  genzyme has marketed a product for the treatment of gaucher disease since genzyme owns or controls issued patents related to the production of protein products to treat fabry disease and gaucher disease 
the markets for some of our potential niche protein products are quite small 
as a result  if competitive products exist  we may not be able successfully to commercialize our products 
our gene therapy system will have to compete with other gene therapy systems  as well as with conventional methods of treating targeted diseases and conditions 
in addition  new non gene therapy treatments may be developed in the future 
a number of companies  including major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as development stage companies  are actively involved in this field 
we are dependent on aventis and other corporate collaborators to develop  conduct clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and  manufacture  market  and sell our principal products we are parties to collaborative agreements with third parties relating to certain of our principal products 
we are relying on aventis to develop  conduct clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market  and sell dynepo  sumitomo to develop and commercialize replagal for fabry disease in japan and other asian countries  and gi to develop and commercialize factor viii gene therapy for hemophilia a in europe 
our collaborators may not devote the resources necessary or may otherwise be unable to complete development and commercialization of these potential products 
our existing collaborations are subject to termination without cause on short notice under certain circumstances 
our existing collaborations and any future collaborative arrangements with third parties may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following our collaborators may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that may be competitive with the product as to which they are collaborating with us  which could affect our collaborative partners commitment to the collaboration with us  reductions in marketing or sales efforts or a discontinuation of marketing or sales of our products by our collaborators would reduce our revenues  which will be based on a percentage of net sales by the collaborator  our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us  which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business and financial communities  and our collaborators may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs  which could affect the collaborator s commitment to us 
we have not generated revenues from the sale of products we are at an early stage of development 
we have not generated revenues from the sale of products 
each of our three product platforms involves new and rapidly evolving technologies 
all of our potential products are in research  preclinical testing  or clinical development 
we will need to conduct additional development efforts for all of these products prior to seeking regulatory approval 
preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of our potential products are limited 
our potential products may not be efficacious or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities  or other characteristics that may prevent or limit commercial use 
we have not been profitable and may require additional funding we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in at  december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect that we will continue to incur substantial losses and that our cumulative losses will increase until then as our research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing efforts expand 
we expect that the losses that we incur will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of products 
we will require substantial funds to conduct research and development  including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our potential products  and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing activities  the cost of commercialization activities  the cost of our additional facilities requirements  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  the timing  receipt  and amount of milestone and other payments from collaborators  the timing  receipt  and amount of sales and royalties from our potential products in the market  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the costs of obtaining any required licenses to technologies  the results of such litigation  and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licenses to use patented technologies 
we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of such stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities and may depend on third party manufacturers we have limited manufacturing experience and in order to continue to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals  and  ultimately  commercialize any products  we will need to develop  contract for  or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities 
we expect to manufacture certain of our products in our own manufacturing facilities 
we will require substantial additional funds and need to recruit qualified personnel in order to build or lease and operate any manufacturing facilities 
we currently rely upon third parties to produce material for preclinical testing and clinical trial purposes 
we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we also expect to rely upon third parties for the commercial production of certain of our products if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
there are a limited number of such third party manufacturers capable of manufacturing for us 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate capacity for our future needs 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing of these products  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of these products or market them 
to the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties  we are dependent upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable government regulations 
if our clinical trials are not successful  we may not be able to develop and commercialize any related products in order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our potential products  we and our collaborators will be required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the products 
we may not be able to obtain authority from the fda or other regulatory agencies to commence or complete these clinical trials 
the results from preclinical testing of a product that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials 
in addition  the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale  advanced stage clinical trials 
furthermore  we  one of our collaborators  or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if the subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  or for other reasons 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  and the existence of competitive clinical trials 
in particular  the patient population for some of our niche protein products is small 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and program delays 
we and our collaborators may not be able to successfully complete any clinical trial of a potential product within any specified time period 
in some cases  we may not be able to complete the trial at all 
moreover  clinical trials may not show any potential product to be safe or efficacious 
thus  the fda and other regulatory authorities may not approve any of our potential products for any indication 
our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we or our collaborators are unable to complete a clinical trial of one of our potential products  the results of any clinical trial are unfavorable  or the time or cost of completing the trial exceeds our expectations 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities 
in order to market our products  we will need to develop this experience and these capabilities or rely upon third parties  such as our collaborators  to perform these functions 
if we rely on third parties to sell  market  or distribute our products  our success will be dependent upon the efforts of these third parties in performing these functions 
in many instances  we may have little or no control over the activities of these third parties in selling  marketing  and distributing our products 
if we choose to conduct these activities directly  as we plan to do with respect to some of our potential products  we may not be able to recruit and maintain an effective sales force 
our success is dependent upon the retention and hiring of key personnel our success is highly dependent on the retention of principal members of our scientific and administrative staff 
furthermore  our future growth will require hiring a significant number of qualified scientific and administrative personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success 
there is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain  on acceptable terms  the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business 
if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement by third party payors for our future products  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products in certain markets the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in certain foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
proposals have been considered periodically by the health care financing administration of the united states department of health and human services to reduce the reimbursement rate with respect to erythropoietin 
adoption by the health care financing administration of any such proposal might have an adverse effect on the pricing of dynepo 
in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system 
we believe that further proposals are likely 
the potential for adoption of these proposals may affect our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborative partners  and market our products 
if we or our collaborators obtain marketing approvals for our products  we expect to experience pricing pressure due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations  and additional legislative proposals 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
we may be subject to additional litigation relating to our intellectual property rights the biotechnology industry has been characterized by significant litigation and interference and other proceedings regarding patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights 
we may become a party to additional patent litigation and other proceedings in the future beyond the patent issues described under we are a party to litigation with amgen and kirin amgen involving dynepo tm  we are a party to litigation with genzyme involving replagal and we are involved and may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our transkaryotic therapy tm technology which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts 
certain of our competitors have filed patent applications and have been issued patents relating to certain methods of producing therapeutic proteins 
we believe that the risk of our becoming involved in patent litigation is significant with respect to the therapeutic proteins that we anticipate producing 
an adverse outcome in any patent litigation or other proceeding involving patents could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain these costs more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
in addition  hearings have been held by congress with respect to the waxman hatch act 
under the safe harbor provisions of the waxman hatch act  activities conducted solely for uses reasonably related to the production of information for submission to the fda as part of seeking regulatory approval to market a product are not acts of patent infringement 
if legislation changing the safe harbor provisions of the waxman hatch act were introduced in congress and enacted  competitors of ours that desire to bring us patent infringement actions against us might be able to do so at an earlier time than under the existing law 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection for our discoveries our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our processes and products in the us and other countries 
the patent situation in the field of biotechnology generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions 
we may not be issued patents relating to our technology 
even if issued  patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  third parties may have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we may not hold proprietary rights to certain product patents  process patents  and use patents related to our products or their methods of manufacture 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third parties 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market certain of our potential products 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we may not be able to market these products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes  and know how 
we seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  and other third party contractors 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may lose important license rights in some circumstances we are a party to a number of patent licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional patent licenses in the future 
these licenses impose various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance  and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license 
we are involved and may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings related to our transkaryotic therapy tm technology which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts we are a party to a proceeding before the us patent and trademark office to determine the patentability of our gene therapy technology 
the participants in the interference are tkt  genetic therapy  inc  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of novartis ag  syntex usa  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of roche holdings  inc  and cell genesys  inc 
this proceeding will determine which of the parties first developed this technology 
if the technology is patentable  the party that first developed the technology will be awarded the us patent rights 
the process to resolve an interference can take many years 
we may not prevail in this interference 
even if we do prevail  the decision in this proceeding may not enable us meaningfully to protect our proprietary position in the field of ex vivo gene therapy 
if we do not prevail in this proceeding  a consent order issued by the federal trade commission in march may be relevant to us 
the federal trade commission entered this consent order to resolve anti competitive concerns raised by the merger of ciba geigy limited and sandoz limited into novartis ag 
as part of the consent order  the constituent entities of novartis are required to provide all gene therapy researchers and developers with nonexclusive  royalty bearing licenses to the novartis patent which is involved in the interference proceeding described above 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement with cell genesys under which we would be permitted to market our non viral gene therapy products pursuant to a royalty free license agreement if cell genesys wins the interference 
some gene therapy clinical trials have been suspended and regulatory authorities are reviewing the need for increased regulation of gene therapy clinical trials due to recent adverse events that have occurred during gene therapy clinical trials  conducted by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and institutions  the federal government  the fda  industry organizations  and institutions conducting gene therapy clinical trials have grown increasingly concerned about the safety of gene therapy clinical trials 
as a result  a number of gene therapy clinical trials have been terminated or suspended 
in february  beth israel placed a temporary moratorium on all gene therapy clinical trials being conducted at its facility  including our clinical trial for hemophilia a  due to national public policy concerns relating to gene therapy trials 
there had been no adverse events associated with our trial 
upon review of our hemophilia a clinical trial safety data  beth israel resumed our gene therapy clinical trial to treat hemophilia a two weeks after its initial suspension 
there can be no assurance that increased concern over gene therapy trials generally will not lead the fda or other regulatory agencies to impose further regulation on gene therapy clinical trials 
if greater regulations are imposed on gene therapy research generally  the delays and costs involved in complying with such greater regulation may impair our ability to complete clinical trials already in progress and to conduct gene therapy clinical trials in the future 
even if we obtain marketing approval  our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing studies 
as to products for which we obtain marketing approval  we  the manufacturer of the product if other than us  and the manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer  or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we announced in march that the cpmp issued a positive opinion recommending approval of replagal tm 
the cpmp s recommendation for approval will be forwarded to the ec  which will determine whether to grant marketing authorization of replagal 
if the ec approves the marketing authorization for replagal  we and our subsidiaries will be subject to on going regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will be able to comply with all applicable requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements with respect to any of our products  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
the market may not be receptive to our products upon their introduction the commercial success of our products that are approved for marketing by the fda and other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective  and safe 
each of our technology programs is new 
as a result  it may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of our products  particularly for the first products for which we obtain marketing approval 
other factors that we believe will materially affect market acceptance of our products include the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals and the countries in which such approvals are obtained  the safety and efficacy of the product as compared to competitive products  and the cost effectiveness of the product and the ability to receive third party reimbursement 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the testing  manufacturing  and marketing of human therapeutic products 
although we have clinical trial liability insurance  we do not currently have any product liability insurance 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or at all 
moreover  any insurance that we do obtain may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we will be exposed to significant liabilities  which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
these liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts
