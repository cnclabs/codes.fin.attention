item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist the reader in evaluating and understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of eastern virginia bankshares  inc and subsidiaries the corporation 
the following analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of eastern virginia bankshares evb and attempts to identify trends and material changes that occurred during the reporting periods 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview eastern virginia bankshares evb reported a decrease in net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  as it focused on long term strategic initiatives 
two initiatives discussed in the annual report were successfully implemented in the first half of  as the imaging system came online in january  and a third banking subsidiary  hanover bank  opened in may 
combined these two strategic moves had an estimated negative impact of thousand or cents per share on year net income 
although these major initiatives  with their short term negative earnings impact  interrupted the corporation s history of earnings growth  they are projected to be in the best interest of shareholders in producing long term growth and value 
additionally the corporation was not immune to the effects of a difficult interest rate environment that placed pressure on net interest income throughout most of the nation s banking industry 
evb s net interest margin decreased basis points from in to in results of operations net income decreased in to million from million in and million in earnings per share decreased to  compared to and for and respectively 
the decrease in net income in was the result of net interest margin pressures  expense increases related to the opening of hanover bank and implementation of an imaging system 
profitability  as measured by evb s return on average equity was  a decrease from s 
return on average assets was  a decrease from the prior year s 
return on average assets remains strong relative to the corporation s peer group average of  based on latest data available while return on equity remains in line with the peer group average of 
the corporation repurchased thousand shares of its common stock in the early months of under a share repurchase program announced by the board in november  the corporation halted the share repurchase program and filed a limited offering of shares with the securities and exchange commission related to the opening of hanover bank in may  that limited offering which resulted in the issuance of thousand shares in the hanover market was completed in december   and the board announced the resumption of a share repurchase program in january  the repurchase plan is intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  declined to in  as compared to in and in however  changes in volume exceeded changes in rates  generating an additional thousand of net interest income in and thousand in the corporation continued to experience strong  but moderating loan demand  throughout  with particularly strong demand in its consumer loan portfolio 
net loans outstanding at year end were up compared to year end and average loans outstanding for the year increased from the average 
the consumer loan portfolio increased while the higher interest rate environment moderated real estate loan demand to growth 
evb s efficiency ratio  a measure of performance based upon the relationship between noninterest expense and income net of securities gains and losses  continues to compare favorably to other virginia financial institutions 
the corporation s efficiency ratio for deteriorated to compared to s outstanding 
a lower efficiency ratio represents greater control of noninterest costs 
fluctuation in the efficiency ratio can be attributed to relative changes in both noninterest income and net interest income as well as noninterest expense 
evb s decline in efficiency ratio was impacted by both the decrease in net interest margin and the noninterest expense increases related to the hanover bank startup and the imaging system implementation 
evb is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax equivalent securities income is further adjusted by the tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the corporation s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the average balances  income and expense  yields and rates table on the following page presents average balances  related interest income and expense  and average yield cost data for each of the past three years 
the volume and rate analysis table reflects changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average volume and average rates 
tax equivalent net interest income increased in to million from million in average loan growth of was the primary factor in the increase in net interest income and in achieving a net interest margin of  a basis point decline from in yield on earning assets increased basis points to in from in  while the cost of interest bearing funds increased basis points from in to in although average earning assets were up with a yield increase of  interest rate pressure increased cost of funds by a much greater as depositors moved funds from lower rate savings and money market accounts to higher cost certificates of deposit 
at times  the corporation found it more cost effective to increase its borrowings from the federal home loan bank rather than to seek unprofitable high interest rate deposits 
average earning asset growth of resulted from increases in average loans outstanding of and average securities of 
growth in the loan and securities portfolios was partially funded by a decrease in federal funds sold 
this change in the mix of average earning assets would have resulted in an increased yield in a stable interest rate environment

interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
the corporation generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to an equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by thousand from million in to million in service charges  the largest source of noninterest income  increased thousand from million in to million in other operating income increased thousand from thousand in to thousand in  primarily the result of an increase of thousand in gains on sale of other real estate owned 
other operating income includes gain on sale of other real estate  credit life premiums  atm fees charged to foreign users  safe deposit box fees  and other miscellaneous income 
realized gain loss on sale of securities was an important factor in the increase in noninterest income as the corporation reported a thousand loss in  compared to a thousand loss in noninterest income decreased thousand from to  attributable primarily to a thousand realized loss on sale of securities in  compared to an thousand gain in year ended december dollars in thousands service charges    gain loss on securities other operating income noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million from million in to million in the hanover bank start up was responsible for million of this increase

the primary contributors to the increase in other operating expenses were consultant fees up thousand or  directors fees up thousand or  and legal collection expense up thousand or 
noninterest expense increased thousand or from million in to million in  primarily the result of salary and benefit expense growth of thousand  consisting largely of thousand in normal increases related to growth  a thousand increase in employee retirement expense based on market fluctuations in pension plan assets at the fiscal year end  and a thousand increase in health insurance expense caused by a one time life insurance expense adjustment 
other expense increases included net occupancy and equipment up thousand related to increased technology investments and full year depreciation on the gloucester branch opened in mid increases in salary and benefit expense and net occupancy and equipment expense were partially offset by a thousand decrease in data processing expense from savings related to technology investments  and a thousand savings in merger expense as compared to years ended december dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits    net occupancy and equipment    printing supplies and postage data processing advertising and public relations other operating expenses    total non interest expense    income taxes income tax expense in was million  down from million in and million in the decrease in income taxes is attributable to decreased taxable earnings at the federal statutory rate of

with the increasing rate environment of  real estate lending growth moderated from s while consumer loan demand increased 
at year end  loans net of unearned income were million  an increase of million over million at year end net loan growth in was completely attributed to the real estate portfolio which grew million or to million from million at year end

residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio as compared to at year end and at year end the corporation attempts to limit its exposure to the risk of local real estate markets by controlling the size of its commercial real estate loan portfolio  and by focusing on real estate loans secured by owner occupied properties 
commercial real estate loans decreased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end 
real estate construction loans accounted for only of total loans outstanding at both year end and the corporation s losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charges offs per year over the last five years 
consumer loans are the second largest component of evb s loan portfolio 
consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  up million or from million at year end  and million at year end 
performance of the consumer loan portfolio is closely tied to general economic conditions in our market region and is impacted by intense competition from both other financial institutions and the automotive industry 
commercial and industrial loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans increasing slightly to of the total loan portfolio from at year end  but well below a historical share of total loans 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the corporation does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the corporation s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  down million from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the corporation s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the corporation s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  and the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
in an environment of generally rising interest rates as experienced in  the level of past due loans usually shows a moderate increase 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members who regularly review loans 
additionally an independent credit review consultant performs a monthly review of loans he selects for southside bank and refers those deemed appropriate to the loan committee of the bank board 
bank of northumberland  inc and hanover bank maintain a review process by senior credit personnel 
as a matter of policy  southside bank and hanover bank place loans on a nonaccrual status when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest  regardless of how well the loan may be collateralized 
bank of northumberland moves loans to a nonaccrual status on the same basis except when management makes a determination that the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
for the corporation  this detailed management process forms the basis for determining the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
from through  improved loan quality  historically low levels of nonperforming assets and improved loan underwriting standards have allowed evb to maintain a lower allowance for loan losses 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end net loans  for  and was   and respectively 
for the same periods the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans was  and  indicating that the allowance is adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
both the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans and the actual dollar amount of nonaccrual loans at december  continue at levels far superior to that experienced prior to the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands average loans outstanding  net of      unearned income allowance for loan losses  january      loans charged off commercial and agricultural real estate consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial and agricultural real estate consumer total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan losses balance  end of year      ratios ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding  end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets  consisting of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days  and other real estate decreased in  continuing a trend that has seen a steady increase in credit quality over the past five years from nonperforming assets in to less than at year end nonperforming assets at december  were million or of total loans and other real estate owned  down from million or at year end  and million or at year end 
nonperforming loans at year end consisted primarily of loans secured by real estate in the corporation s market area 
based on estimated fair values of the related real estate  management considers these amounts recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such past due loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      restructured loans loans past due days and accruing interest   total nonperforming loans      other real estate owned total nonperforming assets      nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans net charge offs to average loans for the year allowance for loan losses to year end loans foregone interest income on nonaccrual loans interest income recorded on nonaccrual loans although trends for credit quality factors continue to improve  it is likely that evb will continue modest provisions for loan losses in the primary factor for additional provision is growth in the loan portfolio as the result of continued improvement in the region s economy and an anticipated environment of decreasing interest rates for the corporation has historically reflected a high level of nonaccrual real estate loans  but has had minimal losses from those loans because of the well collateralized position 
therefore  effective in  management revised its formula for allocation of the allowance to reflect current net loans and nonaccrual loans plus the five year history for net charge offs by loan category  and in added off balance sheet credit risk 
that allocation appears below

loans are viewed as potential problem loans according to the ability of such borrowers to comply with current repayment terms 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
the potential problem loans identified at december  are generally secured by residential and commercial real estate with appraised values that exceed the principal balance 
securities the investment securities portion of the securities portfolio was reclassified to securities available for sale at april   in accordance with the interpretation of fas securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value 
at december   the securities portfolio  at fair market value  was million  a decrease from million at year end 
prior year reporting included available for sale securities at fair market value of million and investment securities at book value of million 
at december   the combined securities portfolio was million  an increase from million at year end 
book value of the investment component of the portfolio was million compared to million at december  the available for sale portion of the portfolio at year end was million compared to million at december  fasb pronouncement no 
effective january   required evb to show the effect of market value changes of securities available for sale 
the market value of this portfolio at year end was million 
the effect of valuing the available for sale portfolio at market  net of income taxes  is reflected as a line in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income loss of thousand at december  and thousand at year end 
evb follows a policy of not engaging in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as options  futures  swaps or forward commitments 
the corporation considers derivatives to be speculative in nature and contrary to evb s historical philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

see note to the consolidated financial statements as of december   for an analysis of gross unrealized gains and losses in the securities portfolio 
deposits the corporation has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost  stable source of funding for the corporation s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
the year saw an environment in which fhlb funding was frequently more cost effective than high interest rate time deposits 
total deposits at december  of million reflected an increase of million compared to million at year end 
non interest bearing deposits increased million to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  while these figures are as of a specific day at year end  it is also meaningful to review average deposits for the year

capital represents original investment by shareholders along with retained earnings and provides financial resources over which management can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings 
at december   evb had total capital of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support each subsidiary s banking business 
capital represents a double edged sword to management as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
when the corporation was formed in  it had a capital structure that far exceeded regulatory guidelines and created significant challenges in managing the return on equity 
in november  the corporation announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
the corporation repurchased thousand shares in early  thousand shares in  and thousand shares in late when the corporation announced a limited stock offering in the second quarter of related to the opening of hanover bank  the share repurchase program was halted 
after successful completion of that limited offering  the board announced a resumption of a share repurchase program in january  the table which follows provides an analysis of the corporation s capital as of december    and note in the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the capital position of each of the subsidiary banks as of year end and analysis of capital december dollars in thousands tier capital common stock    additional paid in capital   retained earnings    total tier capital    tier capital allowable portion of allowance for loan losses    total risk based capital    risk weighted assets    capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets combined with the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  the corporation had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
also outstanding at december   was million of federal funds purchased 
inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude at the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although evb believes that its expectations concerning certain forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results and performance achievements of the corporation will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the corporation s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
guidelines established by management are reviewed by the board of directors 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does not hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary measures 
static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap  at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus or minus of adjusted total assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns of balance attrition and pricing behavior which are reviewed at least annually 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would increase approximately  of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by two percentage points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon  a desirable position in a projected decreasing interest rate environment 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less that a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
