environmental the company operates manufacturing facilities throughout the world and as a result is subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in various countries 
the company also implements a variety of voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate or reduce the generation of hazardous wastes and to decrease the amount of wastewater discharges 
the establishment and implementation of us federal  state and local standards to regulate air and water quality and to govern contamination of land and groundwater has affected  and will continue to affect  substantially all of the company s us manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry in general  and particularly on the chemicals industry 
in addition  the implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs

as a result of the acquisition of hickson  the company s environmental liabilities increased by million 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were not material to operating results in  and but may be material to net income in future years 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were incurred by olin

these amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures  any consideration of insurance recoveries or any advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed or if the costs of remediation efforts can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range from million to million over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs
