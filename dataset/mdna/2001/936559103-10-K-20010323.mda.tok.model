item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary business of the company is the operation of its wholly owned subsidiaries  warwick savings and towne center 
presently  the only significant assets of the company are the capital stock of warwick savings and towne center  the note evidencing the loan the company made to the warwick community bancorp  inc employee stock ownership plan esop to allow the esop to purchase of the company s common stock issued in the company s initial public offering and the investment of the net proceeds of the offering retained by the company 
while the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the company  warwick savings and towne center  this discussion reflects primarily warwick savings activities 
unless otherwise disclosed  the information presented herein reflects the financial condition and results of operations of the company  warwick savings and towne center on a consolidated basis  and as used herein the term company refers to the company and its subsidiaries collectively 
warwick savings results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
warwick savings also generates other income  such as service charges and other fees 
other expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expenses  federal deposit insurance premiums  net costs of real estate owned  data processing fees and other operating expenses 
warwick savings results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
management strategy warwick savings has historically employed an operating strategy that emphasizes the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in its market area with both fixed and variable rates and  to an increasing degree over the past years  its commercial lending business  with mostly prime rate based loans secured by real estate located mainly in orange county  new york 
due in part to this strategy  warwick savings historically has had profitable operations  resulting in a strong regulatory capital position 
warwick savings goal of maintaining this position has led to an overall strategy of managed growth in both deposits and assets 
the major elements of warwick savings operating strategy are to i grow and diversify warwick savings loan portfolio by continuing to originate owner occupied  residential mortgage loans  commercial business and commercial real estate loans  construction loans and consumer loans in its market area  ii complement warwick savings mortgage lending activities by investing in mortgage backed and other securities  iii maintain warwick savings relatively low cost of funds and iv manage warwick savings level of interest rate risk 
from time to time  warwick savings employs a leveraging strategy  whereby borrowings are used to fund specific investments in order to provide for a reasonable net margin of return 
warwick savings also seeks to attract and retain customers through extended office hours  low turnover of employees and prompt  flexible and personalized production of a variety of loan products 
in addition  it is a goal of warwick savings to increase its market share in the communities it serves through the acquisition or establishment of branch offices and  if appropriate  the acquisition of smaller financial institutions 
additionally  it is a goal of the company to expand into new markets 
for this reason  the company has expanded its operations and lending into new jersey  which is one of the reasons the company formed towne center  which is headquartered in bergen county  new jersey 
in february  the company has also acquired hardenburgh abstract company of orange county  inc  a title insurance agency subsidiary  which operates in goshen  new york 
in addition  warwick savings is currently in the process of acquiring the carmel  new york banking office of country bank  which will allow warwick savings to expand into putnam county  new york 
management of interest rate risk the principal objectives of warwick savings interest rate risk management activities are to i evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  ii determine the level of risk appropriate given warwick savings business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  iii establish prudent asset concentration guidelines and iv manage the risk consistent with board approved policies and guidelines 
through such management  warwick savings seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operating results to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
warwick savings closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of warwick savings 
historically  warwick savings has been a traditional thrift lender  but differentiated itself from other thrifts by also focusing on commercial lending since the late s and commission based mortgage banking operations since warwick savings also adopted a more competitive pricing policy  more efficient lock in policies to close loans faster and more streamlined fnma approved processing and underwriting procedures 
additionally  warwick savings array of products has expanded to include fha  va and sonyma loans 
as a result  warwick savings has invested a relatively large amount of its earning assets in fixed rate loans and fixed rate mortgage backed securities with contractual maturities of up to years 
at december   an aggregate of million  or of total earning assets  were invested in such assets 
based upon the assumptions used in the following table  at december   the company s total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap  as defined below  as a percentage of total assets of negative 
accordingly  management views the company as having a manageable gap position  but still slightly vulnerable to a rising interest rate environment 
warwick savings has taken several actions  under various market conditions  designed to manage its level of interest rate risk 
these actions have included i increasing the percentage of the loan portfolio consisting of adjustable rate mortgage loans and prime rate based commercial loans through originations  as market conditions permit  ii selling fixed rate loans  iii purchasing shorter term investment securities and iv seeking to increase the percentage of checking accounts in its deposit base 
additionally  in the normal course of business  warwick savings uses off balance sheet financial instruments primarily as part of mortgage banking hedging strategies 
such instruments generally include put options purchased and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  these financial instruments will develop unrealized gains or losses that mitigate changes in the underlying hedged portion of the balance sheet 
when effectively used  these instruments are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates move up or down 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets or liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by warwick savings  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated early payoffs of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
for loans on one to four family residential properties and mortgage backed securities  assumed average annual prepayment rates of and  respectively  were utilized

footnotes continued on next page for loans on residential properties an average annual prepayment rate of is utilized

certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
for purposes of the npv table  prepayment speeds similar to those used in the gap table were used  reinvestment rates were those in effect for similar products being offered and rates on core deposits were modified to reflect recent trends 
the following table sets forth the company s npv as of december   as calculated by the company 
net portfolio value portfolio value of assets dollars in thousands rate in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change static  based upon the portfolio value of the company s assets assuming no change in interest rates 
as in the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in actual market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
average balance sheets 
the table on the following page sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended december   and the yields and costs were derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances were computed based on average daily balances 
the yields include deferred fees and discounts which are considered yield adjustments

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin on interest bearing assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

warwick savings and towne center s management and boards of directors perform a monthly review of delinquent loans 
the actions taken by warwick savings and towne center with respect to the delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency 
warwick savings policies on residential mortgage loans provide that delinquent mortgage loans be reviewed and that a late charge notice be mailed no later than the th day of delinquency  with the delinquency charge assessed on the th day 
warwick savings collection policies on residential mortgage loans essentially mirror those shown in the fnma servicing agreements 
on other loans  telephone contact and various delinquency notices at different intervals are the methods used to collect past due loans 
it is the company s general policy to discontinue accruing interest on all loans when management has determined that the borrower will be unable to meet contractual obligations or when interest or principal payments are days past due 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  the recognition of interest income ceases 
interest previously accrued and remaining unpaid is reversed against income 
cash payments received are applied to principal  and interest income is not recognized unless management determines that the financial condition and payment record of the borrower warrant the recognition of income 
if a foreclosure action is commenced and the loan is not brought current  paid in full or an acceptable workout arrangement is not agreed upon before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan is generally sold at foreclosure 
property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan or commercial loan is classified as other real estate owned oreo and is recorded at the lower of the unpaid balance or fair value less costs to sell at the date of acquisition and thereafter 
upon foreclosure  it is the company s policy to generally require an appraisal of the property and  thereafter  appraise the property on an as needed basis

this increase in total assets was primarily the result of a increase in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s asset growth was primarily funded through deposit growth  which increased million to million at december  the increase in deposits was primarily attributable to a million increase in certificates of deposit  an million increase in money market accounts  a million increase in savings accounts and a million increase in now accounts and was only partially offset by the thousand decrease in non interest bearing deposits 
included in the million increase in certificates of deposits at december  were brokered deposits in the amount of million 
in conjunction with these brokered deposits  the company entered into a hedging strategy with interest rate swaps to limit its interest rate risk 
under the terms of the agreement  the company agreed to pay interest at a variable rate determined by an independent index  for terms ranging from one to five years  and to receive interest at a fixed rate of over the same terms 
the increased level of deposits also enabled the company to reduce its borrowings from million at december  to million at december  at december   the company had million in securities sold under repurchase agreements and million in term loans from the fhlbny  as compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  asset growth was concentrated in mortgage loans  net  which increased million to million at december  from million at december  other loans  net  increased million to million at december  from million at december  total securities were million at december  compared to million at december  securities held to maturity at december  totaled million as compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
securities available for sale at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  the decrease in securities available for sale was primarily the result of the company s sale of approximately million of lower yielding investment securities and the fact that million of the company s high yielding callable instruments were called  which helped reduce the company s level of wholesale funding at december the fhlbny stock portfolio increased by million in conjunction with both the company s larger asset size and the utilization of wholesale leveraging transactions during the first half of in january  the company obtained bank owned life insurance policies with a value of million 
other assets decreased million due to the decrease in deferred taxes recognized on the unrealized gain on available for sale securities 
total stockholders equity increased million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to net income of million  the million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net  and a valuation adjustment of the deferred tax asset resulting from the company s previous contribution of  shares of its stock to the warwick savings foundation resulting in an increase of thousand in stockholders equity
