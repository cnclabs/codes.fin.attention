continuing operations the continuing operations of the company consist of its software business  which began in mid in the third quarter of  centerspan began development of a peer to peer file sharing and search network utilizing digital rights management technology  which is code named c star 
in december  centerspan purchased certain assets of scour  inc scour as approved by the us bankruptcy court 
prior to its bankruptcy  scour developed internet information location tools and provided other online services 
its search and peer to peer file sharing application  scour exchange  facilitated the search and exchange of digital audio  video and image files over the internet 
we began beta testing of the new scour exchange  incorporating the c star technology  in march to test its secure and legal digital distribution channel  which integrates peer to peer technology with digital rights management support 
to date  more than  beta participants have registered for this beta test 
in the second half of  centerspan plans to launch a tiered paid subscription service

centerspan anticipated to be an investment year  in which the focus was on the distribution of socket to end users and did not expect to generate significant revenue 
the adoption rate of socket has been less than expected  primarily due to a lack of open standards for communications between instant messaging products 
we believe that the future of internet community  collaboration and communications will be driven by open  standards based technology and solutions 
centerspan is using an internet e commerce transaction business model relative to its internet communications software business

results of discontinued operations sale of the hardware business on july   centerspan entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its hardware business including related sales and return warranty reserves 
this transaction closed on october  for million in cash  million of which remains in an escrow account see item legal proceedings 
the company recorded a gain on the disposal of its hardware business of  in the fourth quarter of the sale of the hardware business has been accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  its operations are segregated in the statements of operations included elsewhere in this form k 
revenues from discontinued operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
certain expenses have been allocated to continuing operations  based on the number of employees remaining with the software business  their related employee costs and overhead for facilities and other related costs and corporate overhead expenses that were expected to represent continuing expenses 
loss from discontinued operations was million in compared to loss from discontinued operations of million in the loss from discontinued operations represents the net activity of the discontinued hardware business  including revenues and associated expenses and the resulting tax benefit for the years ended december  and loss from discontinued operations includes the entire tax benefit of the company for the year ended december  as management determined that income tax benefits were primarily associated with the hardware business because the software business had limited activity in centerspan realized a gain on the disposal of its discontinued operations of  in the gain was the difference between the estimated proceeds of the sale and centerspan s basis in the net assets sold and related expenses 
liquidity and capital resources centerspan has financed its activities to date with a combination of cash flow from operations  borrowed funds  proceeds from the sale of its hardware business and proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities 
at december   centerspan had million of working capital and a current ratio of included in total working capital is million of restricted cash  which relates to amounts held in escrow related to the sale of centerspan s hardware business in see item legal proceedings 
in december  centerspan purchased certain assets of scour  inc for million in cash and  shares of its common stock with a value of per share 
also in december  centerspan sold  shares of its common stock to an individual investor for per share for total proceeds of million 
in addition  in february  an additional  shares were sold to the same investor for per share for total proceeds to centerspan of approximately million 
in conjunction with these issuances  the company issued two warrants  each exercisable for  shares of the company s common stock  to five designees of the investor s financial consultant 
the warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of per share and expire in december and february  respectively 
centerspan currently anticipates that it will continue to experience growth in its operating capital expenses as it enters new markets for its products and services  increases marketing activities  continues research and development spending  develops new distribution channels and expands its infrastructure 
these operating expenses will consume a significant amount of the company s cash resources 
management believes that the company s current cash balances  its net proceeds from financing activities in december of and february of and its anticipated revenue growth will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures throughout however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash and cash that may be generated from future operations are insufficient to satisfy the liquidity requirements  the company may seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources  including the sale of certain of the company s assets 
however  there is no certainty that centerspan may be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing and any financing the company obtains may dilute the ownership interest of its shareholders prior to the financing 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which might impact its liquidity requirements or cause the company to issue additional equity or debt securities 
net cash used by continuing operations was million in primarily as a result of a cash loss from operations of million  a  decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million used for the purchase of property and equipment and million used for the purchase of intangibles  offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily a result of a decrease in trade purchases 
at december  centerspan had million of restricted cash 
at the end of march centerspan and guillemot entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release under which centerspan received approximately million of restricted cash from escrow 
guillemot received approximately million  including amounts collected on their behalf and purchase price adjustments called for in the asset purchase contract

risk factors we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks that our solutions are not adopted by consumers 
we commenced our software business in mid accordingly  we have a limited operating history with which you can evaluate our current business and prospects 
our business is new and will not be successful unless consumers adopt wide usage of our products and services and revenues are generated from customers and e commerce partners 
in addition  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the internet file sharing community  collaboration and communications markets 
we have a history of losses  we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we may never generate sufficient revenues for profitability 
we have derived insignificant revenues from our software business and have incurred substantial net losses in every quarter since we began our software operations 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we will achieve profitability 
we incurred net losses from our software business of million in  million in and million in in addition  we plan to increase our operating expenses to implement our peer to peer digital distribution channel through increased staffing and organizational expenses  marketing costs  capital expenditures and other expenses 
as a result  we expect to incur significant operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
we may not achieve anticipated revenues if consumers fail to use our single current product or if we do not successfully introduce products under development  or if consumers fail to use these products once they have been introduced 
the revenue and profit potential related to our single current product  socket tm  and the new scour exchange tm currently under development are unproven 
we have placed over one million copies of the socket tm product  but this product has generated only insignificant revenue to date 
the new scour exchange tm beta testing began in march neither socket tm  the new scour exchange tm  nor other future products may achieve widespread consumer acceptance  which would adversely affect our revenues 
the market for internet digital distribution  community  collaboration and communications products has only recently begun to develop  and if consumers do not widely use these products  our business could be harmed 
we cannot predict the size of the market for internet subscription based digital distribution channels and community  collaboration and communications products  the rate at which that market will grow  or whether consumers will widely accept products such as those we now offer or are developing 
any event that results in decreased consumer use of internet digital distribution  community  collaboration and communications products could harm our business 
we expect to depend on internet based digital distribution and community  collaboration and communications products for substantially all of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
however  the market for these products has only recently begun to develop and may not mature 
we need to establish and maintain strategic alliances with major digital distribution content providers to generate revenues  however  we have entered into only a small number of strategic partnerships 
our revenue model for is based on a subscription based file sharing digital distribution network and from licensing or application service provider fees relative to the new scour exchange tm technology platform 
we have only established a limited number of digital distribution content provider alliances  and these alliances are still relatively new and have not generated significant revenue 
if we fail to maintain or derive the anticipated benefit from our existing relationships or establish and maintain new strategic alliances  we may not be able to expand our distribution and revenues as anticipated 
we may not be able to successfully effect viral expansion 
we anticipate that word of mouth  or viral expansion  will be a large part of our distribution channel 
we anticipate that if we are unable to attract a significant number of customers through viral expansion  we will need to determine other acceptable methods of distribution for our products 
none of these distribution methods may be successful 
our products have short life cycles  and we may not be able to successfully introduce new products before existing cycles end 
the markets for our products are characterized by frequent new product introductions and product obsolescence 
these factors typically result in short product life cycles 
if we do not successfully introduce new products within a given product cycle  our sales will be adversely affected for that cycle and possibly for subsequent cycles 
failure to timely introduce these products could also impair our brand name and ability to maintain relationships with strategic partners 
in addition  each new product cycle presents new opportunities for competitors to gain a product advantage or increase their market share 
we face significant competition from companies that may have greater resources and experience than we do 
the internet subscription based digital distribution channel and community  collaboration and communications business is very competitive 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
our principal competitors include internet music distributors through digital download or streaming technologies such as mpcom  liquid audio  real networks  music labels and movie studios  as well as providers of the instant messaging services  such as aol time warner  yahoo and microsoft 
many of our current and future competitors may have advantages over us  including longer operating histories  larger customer bases  substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  greater name recognition  and the ability to more easily provide a comprehensive software solution 
our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that would increase their ability to compete with us 
in addition  competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs  or to devote more resources to promoting and selling their products 
if we fail to adapt to market demands and to compete successfully with existing and new competitors  our business and financial performance would suffer 
we may not be able to develop acceptable new products or enhancements to our existing products at the rate required by our rapidly changing markets  which could adversely affect us 
our future success depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing high quality products and product enhancements on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
the markets for our products are rapidly evolving 
failure to gain market acceptance of our products  or to develop and release enhanced or new products  or delays or quality problems in doing so  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
as is common in rapidly evolving markets  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products are subject to high levels of uncertainty and risk 
the markets for our products may not expand or develop 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and decrease the value of your investment 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and development personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers  engineering personnel  or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our employees are employed on an at will basis and could terminate their employment with us at any time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our failure to attract and retain additional personnel could adversely affect our business and decrease the value of your investment 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the competition for qualified personnel in the software markets is intense  and we may be unable to attract  assimilate  or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
we attempt to hire engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software in time pressured environments 
there is a limited number of qualified engineers in our geographic location  resulting in intense competition for their services 
we may not be able to make desired acquisitions or integrate acquired assets into our operations 
a component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary companies  products or technologies  such as our acquisition of certain assets of scour  inc we may not be successful in integrating the scour  inc assets or completing and integrating any future acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to complete acquisitions on terms acceptable to us 
in connection with any acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities  which may increase our leverage and cash required to service debt  and incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with strategic partners and customers  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we have limited experience with completing and integrating acquisitions as a team 
our failure to effectively integrate any acquired businesses could adversely affect us 
the strain that changes in our growth rate may place upon our systems and management resources may adversely affect our business and decrease the value of your investment 
any failure to properly manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
growth will place significant challenges on our management  administrative  and operational resources 
to properly manage our business  we must  among other things  implement and improve additional and existing administrative  financial  and operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
we may not be able to complete the necessary improvements to our systems  procedures  and controls necessary to support our future operations in a timely manner 
management may not be able to hire  train  retain  motivate  and manage required personnel and may not be able to successfully identify  manage  and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
we may need to access additional funds to finance ongoing operations  which may require us to commit significant amounts of capital to debt service and could result in dilution to our shareholders 
as of march   we believe that available funds will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next months 
however  additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecast by us may be required and may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
additional financing may involve public or private offerings of debt or equity securities  and may include bank debt 
debt financing may increase our leveraged position  require us to devote significant cash to service debt and limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
any of these results could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and competitive pressures 
equity financing may cause additional dilution to purchasers of our common stock 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which could result in competitors obtaining access to proprietary information 
we regard substantial elements of our products as proprietary and attempt to protect them by relying on patent  trademark  service mark  trade dress  copyright  and trade secret laws and restrictions  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming  and expensive 
in addition  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
any infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
currently issued patents or any new patent applications may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties 
effective trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technology that substantially limits the value of our intellectual property 
others may bring intellectual property infringement claims against us  which could require significant resources to defend and could lead to restrictions on our current operations 
in addition to the technology we have developed internally  we also have acquired or licensed technologies from other companies 
our internally developed technology or the technology we acquired or licensed may infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights and third parties may bring claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
any infringement or claim of infringement could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation 
we may  however  be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
these potential claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
any litigation involving intellectual property  regardless of its success  likely would be time consuming and expensive to defend and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating  or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and redesign those products or services that incorporate the technology at issue 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
product defects could lead to losses of customers 
our products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions or enhancements are released 
despite our internal testing  these errors may be discovered only after our products have been installed and used by customers 
these undetected errors may relate to components supplied to us 
our products are complex as a result of factors including advanced functionality  the diverse operating environments in which the products may be deployed  the potential need for interoperability  and the multiple versions of our products that will need to be supported for diverse operating platforms and standards 
the complexity of our products increases the likelihood that they may contain errors when introduced 
problems encountered by customers or product recalls could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market price for our common stock  like other technology stocks  may be volatile 
the market price of centerspan s common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  our failure to meet analysts performance expectations  and lack of liquidity 
the stock markets have recently experienced stock price and volume volatility that has affected companies stock prices 
the stock markets may continue to experience volatility that may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
fluctuations such as these may affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of centerspan s liquid investments as of december  were at fixed interest rates and had original maturities of days or less 
as a result  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal
