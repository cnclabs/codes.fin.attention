first virginia s philosophy of safety  profitability and growth  always in that order  places a high importance on maintaining a strong capital position and excellent asset quality 
accordingly  first virginia is one of the strongest and most highly capitalized banks in the country 
at the end of  the corporation s capital significantly exceeded regulatory minimums 
the equity to asset ratio was compared to an average of for banks in the corporation s peer group of banks 
this strong capital position permitted the corporation to increase its dividend twice during the year to its current annualized rate of per share 
the corporation has increased the dividend twice per year for consecutive years and has increased the dividend at least once per year for the past years 
in addition  the corporation purchased  shares of its stock in compared to  shares during since  the corporation has purchased an average of million shares of its stock per year and has fewer shares outstanding at the end of than it had in despite numerous acquisitions and share issuances

statement of income net interest income the table on pages through details the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and the economy continued to grow in  extending its record long expansion 
by the end of the year  however  signs were beginning to point to a possible slowdown in the expansion  and concerns that the economy was headed into a recession were surfacing 
throughout and into  the federal reserve increased interest rates in a series of moves designed to slow the economy and remove any threat of inflation 
the increase in interest rates had a slightly negative short term impact on first virginia s net interest margin because the corporation s asset and liability composition is marginally liability sensitive 
first virginia maintains a very liquid portfolio of both assets and liabilities and attempts to mitigate the risk inherent in changing rates in this manner 
due to the nature of its deposit base  however  first virginia will generally perform better in periods of higher interest rates than lower rates 
first virginia is relatively unaffected by absolute levels of interest rates since it attempts to balance its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  although when rates are moving upward  it will have a period of time when liabilities reprice at a faster pace than assets 
the increase in interest rates in and had a negative impact on the net interest margin  and it declined basis points in to and five basis points in to 
also negatively impacting the net interest margin in was a more active share repurchase program that reduced funds available for investment 
while the share repurchase program reduces the net interest margin  it increases earnings per share and the return on common equity and is a tax efficient method of distributing excess equity to shareholders 
net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods first virginia relies almost entirely on its branch network to supply it with a relatively low cost source of funds  and it has no purchased funds and does not need to hedge its position with derivative securities of any kind 
this has produced one of the highest net interest margins among the country s largest banks on a consistent basis 
the yield on earning assets increased one basis point during to  following a basis point decline in the yield on money market instruments  which most closely follows the general interest rate market  rose basis points to 
the yield on the investment portfolio increased four basis points to as rates on maturing instruments closely matched the rates on new instruments 
the yield on the loan portfolio declined basis points in to 
the yield on installment loans dropped eight basis points to  this was a result of the sale of the relatively high yielding credit card loan portfolio in the first quarter of and the growth in automobile loans and home equity loans with their significantly lower interest rates 
these lower rates on installment loans  however  are offset by lower net charge offs and operating expenses compared to credit card loans and on a net basis produce higher returns for the corporation 
the yield on commercial loans  which increased basis points to  tends to follow the general interest rate market since many of these loans have interest rates tied to the corporation s prime lending rate or libor 
also negatively impacting the net interest margin in late and early was a buildup in cash and lower yielding money market instruments as the corporation built extra liquidity to provide for potential yk related customer withdrawals 
these withdrawals did not occur and the funds were redeployed into loans and investment securities in early the cost of funds increased basis points in to after dropping basis points in interest rates on interest checking deposits declined basis points to 
after dropping basis points in because of reduced competitive pressure 
the cost of money market accounts rose basis points in after dropping basis points in in reaction to the general rise in interest rates 
consumer savings deposits followed the same general pattern as interest checking deposits and dropped basis points during compared to a basis point drop in the cost of consumer certificates of deposit rose basis points to in as competition for this source of deposit accelerated in with yields on new instruments approaching at midyear before trending down late in the year 
the cost of large denomination certificates  which tend to have relatively short maturity periods and therefore track the movement of the general interest rate market  rose basis points in to 
similarly  the cost of short term borrowings  comprised of repurchase agreements and commercial paper with customers using first virginia s cash management programs  rose basis points to in these funds are priced to produce a positive spread based on the rates the corporation receives on its own short term money market investments 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses declined in following a decline in the decline  due to a combination of factors including an decline in actual net charge offs  was primarily the consequence of a decline in outstanding loans 
this is in direct contrast to  when the decline in the provision for loan losses was due entirely to a reduction in actual loan charge offs  which were down and partially offset by a increase in outstanding loans 
the large decline in net charge offs in was caused by the sale of the corporation s credit card portfolio in late and early and by a general improvement in loan quality and reduction in charge offs in other loan categories 
this favorable charge off trend continued in with the net charge off rates for indirect automobiles declining three basis points to 
and other consumer loans by seven basis points to 
real estate loans and commercial loans experienced slight increases in net charge offs but from a relatively small base 
overall  the net charge off rate declined two basis points to 
after dropping in half in to 
the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because most of its loans are made in small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as automobiles or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules  and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
the corporation does not have any international  syndicated  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
while approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is comprised of automobile sector loans  the vast majority of these loans are for relatively small amounts to consumers  have regular monthly payment schedules and are of the highest quality so that the risk of exposure is very limited 
the corporation has avoided the subprime segment of both the automobile and home equity loan markets 
noninterest income noninterest income declined to million in after increasing in if the impact of nonrecurring income items is excluded from both years  then noninterest income increased in and in first virginia receives approximately of its gross income from noninterest sources  primarily from service charges on deposit accounts  electronic banking service fees and asset management fees 
income from service charges increased in following increases of and in and  respectively 
in  the increase was largely a result of an thousand increase in fees from two sources business deposit accounts from national customers with multi locations  such as food stores  convenience stores and retailers  and from businesses using the corporation s cash management services 
the increases in and were largely attributable to the value based pricing the corporation instituted in late  which increased fees from consumer transaction accounts 
income from electronic banking services  primarily atm and debit card fees  renewed its pace of growth to in after declining in and growing rapidly in the preceding two years 
the growth in came from the introduction late in the second quarter of the visa checkcard  which was very well received by customers and produced million in additional fee income 
in prior years  increases in income in this category were primarily attributable to increases in fee income from the corporation s atm network  especially fees charged noncustomers for using the corporation s atms 
insurance income declined in after slowing to a growth rate in and in the decline in home equity and automobile lending in reduced insurance commissions from the sale of credit life insurance  and the decline in mortgage lending in was responsible for a decline in sales of title insurance 
the corporation continued to limit its direct mail and telemarketing efforts in response to national concerns over privacy issues 
commission income from the sale of insurance products to businesses increased in  a result of the continued emphasis on building customer relationships 
sales of annuities increased in  following a tripling in  as the corporation increased the number of registered representatives selling annuities and mutual fund products 
income from trust and asset management services continued to increase at a rapid pace  growing in and and in fees from employee trust management  such as pension funds and k plans  increased in with the upgrade of the corporation s internet based k product 
in late  the corporation determined that its credit card activities no longer met its strategic objectives and desired returns 
as a result  it sold the remainder of its credit card loan portfolio and merchant processing business to companies with national concerns that can provide a better value for its customers and greater income to first virginia 
in the fourth quarter of  a portion of the credit card portfolio was sold at a gain of million  and the balance of the portfolio and the merchant business was sold in at a gain of million 
ongoing income from credit card activities was almost eliminated by the end of the second quarter of  and gross income from this area declined to million in and was immaterial in other income in included a gain of million from the sale of six small and slower growth banking offices in virginia  maryland and tennessee 
there were no sales of this type in  however  included a gain of million from the sale of seven offices in maryland 
income also included a gain of million from the sale of the remainder of the corporation s mortgage banking activities when the corporation made a strategic withdrawal from this line of business in the second quarter of and began offering mortgage loans through its website 
income included million in gains from the demutualization of an insurance company in which the corporation owns life insurance policies on the lives of some of its officers 
the corporation recognized gains of 
million in  
million in  and million in from the sale of equity securities 
the corporation s policy is to hold virtually all of its fixed income securities to maturity  and it generally does not have income from this source except for some bonds called by the issuer prior to the maturity date 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses declined in after increasing only in the primary factors behind the decline in noninterest expenses were the disposition of the credit card division in  the closure or sale of branches and the discontinuation of the mortgage banking unit in however  lower net interest income in kept the efficiency ratio unchanged in compared to at  despite the reduction in overall expenses 
efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group salaries and employee benefits increased at a pace less than the inflation rate in both and  advancing only and  respectively 
salaries rose as the tight job market increased the overall level of wages higher than the general inflation rate 
employee health insurance increased to million after several years of relatively small increases  mostly the result of increases in prescription drug costs 
pension expense declined million to a slight net credit because the increase in equity security values over the past several years has increased the corporation s pension fund assets 
stock option related benefits rose thousand to thousand due to a increase in the corporation s stock price 
equipment expense increased in  a lesser pace than the rate in and in when the corporation made its yk preparations 
occupancy expenses increased in both and the increase was primarily the result of a increase in maintenance expense and a increase in utility expense 
with the disposition of the credit card division in late and early  there were no credit card processing fees in after a decline of in amortization of intangibles declined slightly in after increasing in the prior three years  the result of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the acquisition of branches in and from other banking organizations at a premium 
three banking offices were purchased at a premium in  however  the amortization of deposit intangibles added as a result of that acquisition was less than other intangible assets that became fully amortized 
other noninterest expenses declined in  following a increase in legal and professional fees declined million due to lower legal fees for routine lawsuits and a decline in consultants fees related to year conversion work and to the corporation s changes in service charges on deposit accounts implemented in late advertising expense  which peaked in when the corporation increased advertising in order to take advantage of the acquisition of competitors in virginia and maryland by out of state organizations  declined in telecommunications expense increased at a rate in after dropping in when the corporation improved the efficiency of its telephone network 
provision for income taxes income tax expense in declined to million  primarily the result of an decline in pretax income 
gross income was higher because of a million gain on the sale of the corporation s credit card division and a million gain on benefits received from the demutualization of an insurance company in which the corporation held life insurance policies on its officers 
the effective tax rate declined in to from in and in the decline in the effective tax rate in was caused in part by a recapitalization of a subsidiary company in  which allowed the corporation to benefit from some state tax net operating losses accumulated in prior years and which will also reduce future years state taxes 
in addition  greater investments in low income housing partnerships generating federal tax credits  higher investments in tax exempt securities and the recognition of other deferred tax assets also contributed to a reduction in the effective tax rate 
the decline in the effective tax rate was primarily related to declines in taxable income caused by an almost doubling of the tax exempt securities portion of the corporation s investment portfolio in it is anticipated that the corporation will return to its long term trend of gradually reducing tax exempt securities as a percentage of its investment portfolio and that the effective tax rate will rise back to the range in balance sheet first virginia s loan portfolio is its primary earning asset  generating approximately of the corporation s gross income 
nearly all earning assets are funded from deposits originated through the corporation s network of banking offices or from capital 
other sources of funding include customer repurchase agreements and commercial paper originated from business customers who utilize the corporation s cash management products  which are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not fund any of its earning assets from purchased deposits or other nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize any of its earning assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  an increase from the funding rate achieved in this increase was due to a rate of growth for average loans and a slight decline in average funding liabilities 
the table below shows the average balances of the various categories of earning assets as a percentage of total earning assets for the years indicated 
december loans securities money market investments other earning assets 




total loans average loans grew in following growth rates in both and while average loans grew during  consumer loan demand slowed significantly  particularly in the second half of the year  after a strong year for consumer lending in as a result  by december   actual loans were down slightly to billion compared to billion at the end of in late and early  the corporation made the strategic decision to exit the credit card business and sold all of its loan portfolio in this area 
the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is automobile related  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles and loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles and  to a lesser extent  their facilities 
as the corporation has exploited this expertise over the past six years  the percentage of loans that are automobile related increased from of the loan portfolio at the end of  to at the end of as a result of the economic slowdown  the demand for dealer automobile loans declined during  and new loan originations declined by compared to the weakness in auto sales prompted many of the automobile manufacturers to offer low rate financing through their automobile finance subsidiaries  further exacerbating the weakness in new loan volume 
however  outstanding automobile loans only declined at the end of  following increases of in and in the corporation has consolidated all of its automotive related lending under one company  which permits it to maximize its service capabilities and take full advantage of new technology 
after opening several new sales offices in the preceding three years  the corporation did not open any in  but it remains committed to a strategy of gradually expanding its market  primarily in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a maximum term of months 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages  and servicing and funding costs are among the lowest in the industry  giving the corporation a competitive advantage 
first virginia uses an experienced loan reviewer in underwriting each loan in these local loan production offices and does not rely on credit scoring models 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval to the dealer originating the loan 
once made  the loans are serviced centrally to ensure consistency and quality of collection at the lowest cost 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans rose in following a rise in outstanding floor plan loans increased in after a more modest increase in when automobile dealers could not obtain inventory quickly enough to keep pace with sales 
the slowdown in sales by the end of allowed dealers to rebuild their inventories from the depleted levels of the corporation does not make leases in its own name but offers automobile dealers a leasing product through an unaffiliated partner who bears the entire risk of the transaction in return for a fee for our origination activity 
although income from this source was relatively immaterial in and  it remains part of the corporation s total service approach to the dealer community 
first virginia is committed to being a full financial services provider to the automobile market  regardless of swings in the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
home equity loans are the second largest component of the corporation s consumer lending portfolio  comprising approximately of outstanding loans at the end of these loans have declined steadily over the last several years  dropping in and in  as strong home sales and refinance activity in and early induced consumers to pay off and consolidate both their existing home equity loans and other consumer credit debts into new first mortgage loans at cheaper rates 
while this refinance activity slowed in mid  outstanding loans still continued to decline because first trust mortgage loans still offered more attractive refinance terms 
in the first quarter of  the corporation closed the offices of first general mortgage company  its home equity lending subsidiary 
it had operated in areas where the corporation did not have a banking presence  and the possibility of cross selling additional services and building total customer relationships was impractical 
first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans with low loan to value ratios that enable the corporation to show a nominal net charge off rate 
these loans are originated through the corporation s banking offices 
residential real estate loans comprise approximately of total loans 
this category declined in and in after a increase in when the corporation expanded its year mortgage loan portfolio 
the corporation originates all of its own real estate loans through its banking offices primarily in the form of year  fixed rate real estate loans that have many of the characteristics of a home equity loan 
the corporation s real estate loan portfolio has not been as subject to early prepayment as some banks portfolios because it limits itself primarily to year  fixed rate loans 
these loans do not contain the same prepayments risk as adjustable rate mortgages or mortgages with longer contractual lives that are likely to be refinanced when interest rates decline 
loans december consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit loans  including credit cards      other      commercial      construction and land development      real estate commercial mortgage      residential mortgage excluding loans held for sale      total loans  net of unearned income      average commercial loans increased in and in the corporation has been emphasizing this loan category over the last several years  stressing the relationship nature of its program  and it has been successful in cross selling its cash management  insurance and asset management services 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its affiliate banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between to million  generally with a maximum amount of million 
the corporation originates all of its own loans to businesses headquartered within its market footprint and does not participate in loans with other organizations nor in nationally syndicated credits 
although construction loans increased in and in  they still comprise a relatively small of total loans outstanding at december  the corporation makes construction loans primarily for residential development projects or commercial office space that is built for the borrowers own use  and it does not lend for speculative  unleased properties 
commercial real estate loans increased in and in the corporation s commercial real estate loans are mostly made for owner use properties  generally carrying floating or adjustable interest rates 
investment securities the corporation has classified virtually all of its investment portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
approximately of the portfolio is classified as available for sale  either to provide additional liquidity in certain circumstances or because the special nature of the securities requires that they be classified as available for sale 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
this supplies liquidity to fund loan growth and provides for a natural hedge against changes in interest rates 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
average outstanding securities declined by in following an increase in most of the decline in outstanding investment securities began to occur in the second half of when the corporation  experiencing strong loan demand and modest deposit growth  allowed the investment portfolio to mature to fund the loan growth 
in addition  in the second half of  the corporation began to build liquidity for potential yk related deposit withdrawals caused by consumer concerns with the millennium created computer problems 
accordingly  minimal reinvestment of securities in the second half of occurred 
in january  when it became apparent that there were no computer difficulties and deposit withdrawals did not occur  the corporation resumed its normal program of investments 
coupled with a moderation in loan demand during  additional funds were placed in the investment portfolio leading to an increase in average outstanding balances in the second half of the year 
since rates on maturing securities were similar to rates on newly acquired securities  the yield in the portfolio increased a modest four basis points in to 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with maximum lives of approximately five years 
at the end of  the month average term of these securities was less than the month average term at the end of and because of the callable nature of some of these securities  the actual duration of the portfolio may be slightly less than the average term 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio compared to at the end of a higher percentage of new securities was placed in us government and agency securities in compared to when a flight to quality in late  caused by an international bond collapse in asia and russia  led to greater investments in tax exempt municipal securities whose rates were more attractive relative to those offered by us government and agency securities 
over the past several years  a greater proportion of new securities have been placed in us government agency securities and less in us treasury securities 
this is due to the lower yields available on us treasury securities and the lack of availability of these securities in certain maturity ranges  a direct consequence of the elimination of the federal deficit and the reduction in the federal debt 
this trend is expected to continue over the next several years as the federal debt continues to be paid down and the supply of us government notes and bonds is reduced 
money market investments money market investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average money market investments increased to million after declining in when loan demand was stronger 
the increase was caused in part by a reduction in loan demand  particularly in the second half of the year when the economy began to slow its rate of growth 
however  the increase was caused primarily by an increase in average available investable funds  a consequence of reductions in cash held in the corporation s banking offices 
in early  a program was implemented to reduce the level of actual currency and coin held in the corporation s banking offices to take advantage of declines in required regulatory reserves  a consequence of programs implemented in the preceding three years 
this program of cash management reduced average cash balances on hand by approximately million 
in  money market investments had increased as a decline in interest rates and a flat to inverted yield curve made these investments relatively more attractive 
deposits average deposits declined in to billion after increasing a modest in impacting the slight decline in was the sale of six banking offices with million in deposits and the consolidation of offices into other nearby first virginia offices 
these closed or sold offices were located in slower growth markets  near other first virginia offices or were isolated in markets where first virginia could not gain a major market presence 
because the corporation s objective is to be in the first  second or third market share position in the markets it serves  it regularly reviews each of its offices for profitability and future growth potential 
if these goals cannot be achieved  then the office will be considered for disposition 
the corporation offers a variety of accounts that appeal to different target groups 
the firstvantage plus account  which offers an attractive array of services to the high balance customer  was enhanced in and has grown substantially in the past three years 
other accounts  appealing more to the typical mid balance customer  provide relationship linkages that avoid service charges 
the corporation s extensive branch office network creates a strong retail focus  resulting in a higher percentage of customers maintaining balances in transaction accounts compared to other banks 
in  of the corporation s average deposits were comprised of demand and interest checking accounts  up slightly from the and these accounts comprised of total deposits in the preceding two years 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    money market savings    consumer cds    large denomination cds total deposits    average demand deposits and interest checking accounts rose in following a increase in the corporation s extensive branch network is responsible for the greater mix of lower cost transaction accounts and permits the corporation to maintain one of the lowest cost of funds among the largest banks in the country 
average money market accounts declined to million in  after rising in and in these increases are attributed to several years of effort to increase this category by offering interest rates slightly higher than competing banks 
an increase in the overall level of interest rates in caused money market mutual funds and other banks to increase rates  reducing some of the competitive advantage and attractiveness of the corporation s accounts 
this general increase in interest rates also made the corporation s regular savings accounts relatively less attractive and average balances declined to billion following several years of stable to slightly declining balances 
the federal reserve increased interest rates three times during  following three earlier increases in  in an effort to slow down the surging economy and reduce the risk of inflation 
this caused the corporation s overall cost of funds to increase by basis points in to following a basis point decline in this general increase in interest rates created a great deal of competition for funds among banks  particularly in the consumer certificate of deposit category where rates on several of these instruments increased to the upper range in mid before moderating somewhat at year end 
as a consequence  the corporation s cost of funds in this area rose basis points in to  following a decline in despite the increase in rates  average balances in this category declined to billion following a decline in most of this decline occurred early in the year  and by year end this category was once again growing in outstanding balances  fueled by concerns about the slowing economy  higher interest rates for these certificates and a general weakening in the stock market  which induced consumers to seek the certificates safety and attractive yield 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased to million 
the cost of funds for this category increased at a more rapid pace than consumer certificates and rose by basis points after dropping basis points in most of these instruments come from the corporation s core consumer customers and from state and political jurisdictions that maintain other relationships with the corporation 
because they are generally for a much shorter average duration  their cost moves more quickly in response to changes in interest rates 
the corporation does not purchase brokered deposits nor does it solicit deposits outside of its primary market areas 
maturity ranges for certificates of deposit with balances of  or more on december   were maturity ranges amount one month or less  after one through three months  after three through six months  after six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  other interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings consist primarily of securities sold by the affiliate banks with an agreement to repurchase them on the following business day and commercial paper issued by the parent company 
these short term obligations are issued principally as a convenience to commercial customers in connection with the corporation s cash management services 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased by in and from to in each of the preceding three years 
these increases are a result of the corporation s success in increasing the number of commercial customers utilizing its sophisticated cash management services  including treasury workstation for larger businesses and business express  an internet product introduced in for small and medium sized businesses 
long term debt is comprised of capitalized lease obligations on branch office facilities that are not subject to prepayment and an equipment note for the purchase of the corporation s mainframe computer 
shareholders equity first virginia has historically been one of the most highly capitalized banking companies in the nation  a reflection of its principles of safety  profitability and growth  in that order 
the ratio of total capital to total assets declined to at the end of following a basis point rise in to 
this decline in the equity to asset ratio  due in part to an increase in total assets  was primarily the result of an increased share repurchase program in that caused a reduction in total capital 
these ratios are significantly higher than the capital to assets ratio maintained by banks in the corporation s peer group of to billion asset sized banks 
despite the decline in total capital  book value per share  aided by the corporation s share repurchase program  increased in to  following a increase in return on total average equity the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group during  the corporation purchased  shares of its stock at a total cost of million  following the  shares purchased in at a total cost of million 
the corporation s board of directors approved a six million share repurchase program in and there were  shares eligible for repurchase at the end of since  several plans to repurchase the corporation s common stock have been approved  and the corporation has purchased an average of million shares per year 
in the course of its repurchase programs  the corporation has employed the use of equity put warrants and accelerated share repurchase contracts 
first virginia and its affiliate banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
because of the high level of capital and the conservative nature of its assets  the corporation exceeded the additional regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins 
the tier risk based capital ratio declined basis points in to  the result of a decline in equity caused by the corporation s share repurchase program 
this followed an increase of basis points to in when the level of share repurchase activity was lower 
the total capital ratio declined by basis points in to for the same reason  while the leverage ratio declined basis points to 
each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
asset quality the corporation has a number of policies  reviewed regularly by senior management  to ensure that the risk in lending and investment activities is minimal  while the profit is consistent with the exposure to risk 
each affiliate bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies  and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs  as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign  nationally syndicated or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the affiliated banks or in surrounding states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia affiliated group 
in addition  participations among banks within the first virginia group must first be shared with the corporation s lead bank  where a second comprehensive loan review is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower  and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers  both directly through the corporation s branch network and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly half of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans  but because loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of major charge offs is minimized 
the corporation s automobile loans consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially fewer risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquencies  charge offs and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  subprime loan categories tend to generate very high delinquencies and charge offs  while the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets increased million to million as of december   compared to million at the end of as a percentage of total loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure  nonperforming assets increased three basis points to 
when compared to the previous year s record low of 
despite the slight increase in  the ratio of nonperforming assets has been generally trending downward since and has consistently been much lower than the average for similar sized banks in the corporation s national and regional peer groups 
there were no concentrations of foreclosed real estate or nonaccruing loans in any specific geographic location or type of property  and the majority of nonperforming assets were comprised of smaller balance loans to consumers 
nonperforming assets ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group the table below shows the total of nonperforming assets at the end of each of the past five years

loans past due days or more declined at the end of by million to million or

of total loans at the end of the corporation s delinquency ratio is significantly below industry averages and reflects the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans are classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
installment loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are delinquent days 
all other loans are generally placed in nonaccrual status when they are days delinquent 
loans may be classified as nonaccrual sooner if specific conditions so indicate 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to an accruing status when principal and interest are no longer past due and future collection of principal and interest are not in doubt 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the above table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million 
the majority of these loans represent commercial or property related loans 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 
due to the homogeneous nature of a large percentage of the corporation s outstanding loans  a significant portion of the allowance is not determined by individual loan reviews 
rather  the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for loan losses are evaluated by management based on the value of underlying collateral  economic conditions and unique marketplace factors that might affect the collectibility of the loans 
as a result  these judgments involve an inherently higher degree of uncertainty 
historical results and loss experience may not reflect this risk to the extent it might currently exist 
for other portions of the corporation s loan portfolio  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of individual loans and commitments where internal credit evaluations result in ratings that are below standards adopted and periodically updated by the corporation 
other risk factors taken into account include recent loss experience in specific loan categories  underwriting standards and changes in credit quality  and changes in volumes or concentrations of credit risk 
reserve coverage ratio the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group net charge off ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group in the case of construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  loans are reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality 
each loan in excess of  is examined individually and a specific allocation determined if full collectibility is in doubt 
this component of the overall allowance is relatively small and totaled million at the end of  including 
million for loans classified as impaired 
loans specifically reviewed comprise of the total loan portfolio  and the allocated allowance for these loans represented approximately of the total allowance for loan losses 
the remainder of the allowance is unallocated and provides for the of the loan portfolio that is comprised of small  homogeneous loans to consumers and uncertainties such as adverse economic conditions 
no specific allocation of the allowance is made for individual loans in this category 
instead  these loans are divided into various groups with similar characteristics and evaluated collectively 
these loans tend to be for relatively short durations of three to seven years and are generally secured by automobiles or residential real estate and have fairly consistent charge off experience 
net charge offs declined slightly in to

allowance for loan losses to year end loans liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in substantially all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  down from months at the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio is typically between two and three years as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the affiliate banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
the majority of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the table on the following page 
maturity ranges and interest rate sensitivity between after one year one and five or less five years years total commercial     construction and land development     total     fixed rate loans    floating rate loans    total    first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s affiliate banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or decrease  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declines to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the following table 
however  the degree and frequency of movement is more limited in practice  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

x x x first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more dynamic version of the information shown in the preceding table that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities 
these adjustments take into account that interest rates on individual asset and liability categories may change at a different pace from their contractual rate 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rates 
while first virginia s liability sensitivity in the short term indicates that an increase in interest rates may negatively affect short term net interest income  management would likely take actions to minimize its exposure to negative results and within a relatively short period of time make adjustments so that net interest income would not be materially impacted 
for example  the corporation s net interest margin has averaged over the past ten years  and prior to this year s result of  the corporation exceeded every year since  despite wide changes in interest rates 
at the same time  the corporation has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in loan and deposit demands 
using shock analysis of a hypothetical  immediate increase in all interest rates of basis points and comparing that to the anticipated interest rate environment over the next months also indicates that net interest income would decrease by  while an immediate and hypothetical decrease in rates of basis points would increase net interest income by 
such an immediate change in all rates would be highly unlikely in management s opinion 
the corporation s dynamic simulation modeling takes into account the effects such changes may have on overall economic activity  the reaction of individual categories of assets and liabilities  and the impact that different management actions may have on net interest income 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the volatility its interest sensitive gap position or shock analysis may indicate 
over time  or under stable interest rate conditions  net interest income will tend to be greater at higher interest rate levels 
this is due to the large proportion of low cost core deposits such as demand  interest checking  savings and money market accounts comprising the corporation s funding sources  which can be invested in relatively higher yielding loans and investments

cash basis recurring income  which excludes both the effects of intangible assets and their related amortization and nonrecurring income items  equaled million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the prior year s fourth quarter 
cash basis recurring income produced a return on average tangible assets of in the fourth quarter and a return on average tangible shareholders equity of  compared to and  respectively  in the fourth quarter 
average loans declined slightly in the fourth quarter to billion compared to billion during the third quarter and billion during the prior year s fourth quarter 
growth in average commercial loans continued to be strong  increasing at an annualized pace over the third quarter of 
however  demand for consumer loans  primarily automobile and home equity loans  continued to weaken during the fourth quarter  causing a decline in average consumer loans at an annualized rate of compared to the third quarter  accounting for the slight decline in average total loans 
average deposits declined to billion compared to the third quarter largely due to the sale of five branch offices during the quarter 
the net interest margin declined seven basis points to during the fourth quarter compared to the achieved in the third quarter 
despite the decline  the corporation s net interest margin remains among the highest of any of the largest banks in the country 
noninterest income increased in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year 
excluding a million nonrecurring gain on the sale of five branch offices in the fourth quarter  noninterest income increased at a rate to million compared to million in service charges on deposit accounts increased at a pace  aided by an increase in income from internet based accounts and higher service charge income on commercial accounts 
electronic banking service fees increased compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  the direct result of the introduction of the corporation s new visa checkcard  which produced million in fee income and is continuing to grow very rapidly 
trust and asset management fees rose compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
noninterest expense increased less than compared to the prior year s fourth quarter
