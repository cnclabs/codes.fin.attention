item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a contract manufacturer of highly engineered metal and plastic components and subassemblies for construction  agricultural and industrial original equipment manufacturers 
our largest customers  caterpillar inc and deere co  accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we price our fabricated metal and thermoformed plastic products on a cost plus basis and use an industry standard to price our injection molded plastic products 
in pricing our products  we consider the volume of the product to be manufactured  required engineering resources and the complexity of the product 
our customers typically expect us to offset any manufacturing cost increases with improvements in production flow  efficiency  productivity or engineering redesigns 
as a part of their supplier development programs  our primary customers initiate cost improvement efforts on a regular basis 
at the conclusion of any such effort  when savings can be documented  we share the savings with our customer 
we have historically grown net sales and increased profitability through increased penetration of our key customers 
we have increased the number of customer equipment models that include our products and have increased the number of our products on each of our customers equipment models 
we have also grown our net sales by expanding into the southeastern united states 
in addition  we have increased our product offerings to our customers through acquisitions 
these acquisitions allow us to better serve our customers growing outsourcing needs

the worthington custom plastics acquisitions made during provided incremental net sales of approximately million 
sales decreased by million in the operations owned in both and  primarily from decreased sales of components and subassemblies used in agricultural machinery 
this decrease relates to a softening in demand for agricultural products that began in the fourth quarter of and is continuing 
sales to caterpillar and deere were approximately and of our net sales for and  respectively 
we were selected to manufacture a number of additional components for new construction and industrial products for caterpillar and deere in sales of these additional components partially offset the loss of agricultural sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the worthington custom plastics acquisition provided million of incremental gross profit

this increase relates primarily to costs incurred by the operations acquired in  a full year of selling and administrative costs related to the acquisitions  approximately  of costs written off in the first quarter   consisting of costs associated with a suspended high yield financing  and  associated with fees related to amendments in the company s credit facilities 
we sold the assets of carroll george inc on december  for million and incurred a loss of approximately million

we incurred a charge of million  net of a state income tax benefit  for the cumulative effect of adopting aicpa statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities which requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
an income tax benefit of million was recognized as a previously established state income tax reserve was no longer required 
financial position and liquidity historically  we have funded our business with cash generated from operations and borrowings under revolving credit and term loan facilities 
in the years ended december   and  we generated used cash from in operating activities of 
million  million and million respectively 
our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million respectively 
these capital expenditures were principally for additions to improve or maintain our manufacturing capacity and efficiency 
in the most significant cash transactions  we sold land  a product line and a metal machining division  generating cash proceeds of approximately million 
sales proceeds were used to reduce debt 
our consolidated working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this represents an increase in working capital of approximately million 
we have two separate credit facilities 
the first facility is with harris trust and savings bank harris  and serves the company s operations other than the operations acquired from worthington custom plastics  inc worthington 
the second facility  with general electric capital corporation gecc  serves the operations acquired from worthington during the second quarter  these facilities are separate and provide financing for the named operations 
the two credit facilities are separately secured by the assets of the operations they support 
on may    we entered into a credit agreement with harris  as agent 
the credit agreement  as last amended in december   provides a credit facility with the following components i a million secured revolving credit facility  ii a million secured term loan that matures years from the date of the credit agreement closing  and iii a million secured term loan that matures years from the date of the credit agreement closing 
both term loans fully amortize over their respective terms with quarterly payments 
the interest rates on the loans vary from to above the lender s prime rate 
we used the proceeds under the facility to refinance the then existing indebtedness  to finance the acquisitions  and for general corporate purposes 
as described in note of the accompanying financial statements  warrants were issued on september  in connection with the harris credit agreement 
the amount of revolving credit availability is calculated using a borrowing base of qualified accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had additional availability of approximately million under the harris facility 
we are paying this lender a fee of 
per month based upon the amount of the revolving credit commitment and the balance of the term loans 
in connection with the harris financing  we have two fixed interest rate swap agreements with a commercial bank the counter party 
the first agreement has a notional principal amount of million and a termination date of may  the second agreement has a notional principal amount of million and a termination date of june  the notional principal amount declines over the term of both agreements based upon a defined amortization schedule 
the counter party has the unilateral right to cancel both agreements as of june  as described in item a below  these agreements are for the purpose of limiting the effects of interest rate increases on half of the company s floating rate term debt 
our sources of funds to meet near term liquidity requirements for the businesses not acquired from worthington will be the cash flows from operations  the harris line of credit  and management of working capital to reflect current levels of operations 
we believe that these sources will be adequate through the end of the current fiscal year and beyond 
our separate financing arrangements for the operations acquired from worthington are described below 
on april   we entered into a financing agreement with gecc 
the agreement contains a year secured revolving credit facility with maximum availability of million and a million secured term loan with a year term 
the amount of availability is based upon a borrowing base of qualified accounts receivable and inventory 
both of the facilities bear interest at variable interest rates based on the prime rate  plus variable margins 
we also incur a fee based upon a certain percentage of the unused revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility amortizes quarterly throughout its term 
we must also prepay certain amounts from the sale of assets  the issuance of new equity capital and from excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
as of december   we had additional availability of million  under the gecc credit facility 
we believe that the agreement with gecc  as amended in march   will provide the necessary term and revolving financing  and along with cash flows from operations  will provide the necessary levels of liquidity for the operations acquired from worthington through the end of the current fiscal year and beyond 
as part of the financing for the worthington acquisition  we issued  shares of redeemable preferred stock  which we must redeem in april  at  per share plus any dividends accrued since april  the million face value preferred stock was recorded at its fair value of million 
we are accreting the discount over a five year period using the effective yield method 
dividends are payable in kind at the rate of per annum 
we believe that certain provisions of the agreement with worthington preclude the payment of dividends  and no dividends have been accrued in there are current legal proceedings related to certain worthington matters as described in part i  item on november   the company entered into an agreement with first union securities  inc fusi  under which fusi will act as the company s exclusive financial advisor with respect to possible debt or equity financings or recapitalizations 
mark mealy  a director of the company  is a managing director at fusi 
we incurred million of capital expenditures during  primarily for purchases of manufacturing equipment 
we estimate that our capital expenditures in will total approximately million of which million will be for new production equipment and the remaining million will be for normal replacement items 
year readiness we completed our preparation in for the year date change 
our plan addressed all hardware  software and microprocessor embedded technologies 
we also surveyed our customers and suppliers year readiness 
we noted no significant disruptions in service and we were able to fully utilize our core business unit systems  including order entry  inventory management  purchasing  payroll  invoicing  accounts payable  accounts receivable and general ledger 
we expended approximately  in our year readiness effort 
we will continue to monitor our systems and customer and supplier readiness throughout to address unanticipated problems which may include problems associated with non year issues and disruptions to the economy in general and ensure that all processes continue to function properly 
seasonality our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  the purchasing schedules of our key customers 
our sales and profits historically have been higher in the first half of the calendar year due to our largest customers preparation in the first two quarters for increased demand during the warmer months of the year 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  with the effective date amended by statement no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  then depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value will either be offset through earnings  against the change in fair value of hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in income 
the ineffective portion of a hedge s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in income 
the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our lines of credit and long term debt used for maintaining liquidity  funding capital expenditures and expanding our operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we entered into two separate financing agreements with a group of banks and another lender 
both financing arrangements contain term loans and revolving credit facilities 
interest is based on our lead bank s or lender s prime rate plus an applicable variable margin 
we have also entered into two interest rate swap agreements  as required by our bank financing arrangement  to limit the effect of increases in the interest rates on half of our floating rate term debt 
we do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
under the swap agreements  which expire may  to june   the interest rate component of the interest rate is limited to on half of our  term loans under that certain financing arrangement
