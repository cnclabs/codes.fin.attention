item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a chemical company 
our initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese corporation with american hoechst corporation  we were spun off as an independent biopharmaceutical company 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and commenced the research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
we discontinued the biotreatment operations in to focus on our targeted small molecule cancer and immunology compound development programs and our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program 
between and  our revenue had been generated primarily through the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
however  as revenue from thalomid sales  license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs increased  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus 
accordingly  on january   we completed the sale of our chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation for million 
terms of the sale provided for a payment to celgene of million at closing and future royalties on product sales not to exceed the net present value on the initial date of the sale of million  with a guarantee of certain minimum payments to celgene beginning in the third year following the close of the agreement 
in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid thalidomide for use in enl  a side effect of leprosy  and in late september  we commenced sales of thalomid in the united states 
sales have grown rapidly each year since the launch and in  we recorded net sales of thalomid of million 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering to sell  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
 shares were for our account and  were for the account of a selling shareholder pursuant to the conversion of  of the  january convertible notes held by that shareholder 
proceeds to the company  net of offering expenses  were approximately million 
on april   we signed a license and development agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis a world wide license for d methylphenidate  our chirally pure version of ritalin 
the agreement provides for up to million in up front and milestone payments based on achieving various regulatory approvals and royalties on the entire family of ritalin products upon approval of d mph by the fda 
we have retained the rights for the use of d mph in oncology indications 
on august   we completed a merger  accounted for as a pooling of interests  with signal pharmaceuticals  inc  signal  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
we have sustained losses in each year since our inception as an independent biopharmaceutical company in in  we had a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million and at december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize thalomid  develop our other oncology and immunological disease programs  and advance the drug discovery and development programs at signal 
we also expect increased sales of thalomid  revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and continued investment income 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe there are significant market opportunities for the pharmaceutical products and processes under development by us 
to address these and potential future opportunities in a timely and competitive manner  we intend to seek out drug discovery and development collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
we have entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for us of certain compounds  such as thalomid  and the development by us of processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
the latter development activities are performed through celgro corporation  our wholly owned agrochemical subsidiary 
we have established a commercial sales  marketing and customer service organization to sell and support thalomid and as of february   we employ persons in this capacity 
we intend to develop and market our own pharmaceuticals for indications with economically accessible patient populations in our disease franchises 
for drugs with indications outside the oncology and immunological disease fields and for larger patient populations  we anticipate partnering with other pharmaceutical companies 
we currently partner with companies such as novartis for the development and commercialization of our chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
we expect these arrangements typically will include some combination of license fees  milestone payments  reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements 
we also may acquire products or companies to expand our product portfolio and to augment our development and commercialization resources 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones and our ability to control costs 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenues 
our total revenue for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the same period in revenue in consisted of net thalomid sales of million  research contract revenue of million and related party collaborative agreement revenue of million compared with net thalomid sales of million  research contract revenue of million and revenue from related party collaborative agreements of million in the growth in thalomid sales primarily is related to increased use in oncology 
research contract revenue increased in primarily as a result of the recognition of million of the million nonrefundable upfront license fee payment received in connection with a collaborative agreement entered into with novartis pharma ag in april  and a million milestone payment related to the same agreement with novartis 
total revenue in increased significantly to approximately million from million in the increase primarily was the result of our first full year of product sales of thalomid in of approximately million compared with million of thalomid sales in following fda marketing approval in july revenue from research contracts decreased to million in from million in  while related party collaborative agreements increased to million in from million in the decrease in research contract revenue was primarily due to the termination of the tanabe agreement in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in the year ended december   was approximately million compared with approximately million in the increase in cost of goods sold reflects the higher volume of thalomid sales in in addition  the cost of goods sold during the first quarter of and the full year of does not reflect raw material or formulation and encapsulation costs of thalomid  as these costs were incurred and charged as research and development expenses prior to receiving fda marketing approval 
increase in cost of goods sold for compared to is primarily the result of increased sales volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by for the year ended december  to approximately million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to spending for preclinical toxicology and pharmacology studies and phase i and phase ii clinical trials for our selcids and imids  completion of the pivotal clinical trials and preparation for filing the nda for d methylphenidate d mph  our chirally pure version of ritalin  and preclinical product development for our serm selective estrogen receptor modulators cancer program 
additionally  there was an increase in the recognition of compensation expense recorded for stock options granted by signal during the first quarter of research and development expenses for increased approximately to million from million in increased spending for clinical trials  primarily for d mph  and research and preclinical development of drug leads in our kinase and serm programs was offset by a decrease in regulatory consulting fees  university research program spending  and production of thalomid capsules which was charged as research and development expense prior to receiving fda marketing approval in july of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in the increase was due primarily to the expansion of our sales and marketing organization and related expenses  and spending for customer service  warehousing and distribution  all to support the growth in thalomid sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by over  from approximately million to approximately million 
the increase was primarily in sales and marketing expenses  warehousing and distribution expenses and expenditures relating to medical affairs and drug safety costs  all to support the commercialization and distribution of thalomid 
merger related costs 
we incurred one time costs of million associated with the merger with signal pharmaceuticals  inc in these costs were primarily related to fees for financial advisors  accountants  lawyers and financial printers 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income in increased significantly to million from million in the increase was due to the investment of the net proceeds of approximately million from the follow on public offering in february  and million received from novartis pharma ag in july related to the license and development agreement entered into in the second quarter of interest income for of million was slightly lower than the million in as average cash balances were lower in interest expense decreased significantly in to million from million in the decrease was primarily the result of the conversion to equity of a significant portion of the outstanding long term convertible notes throughout also  in september  we entered into an agreement with the remaining convertible noteholders which allows the noteholders to take a short position in our common stock 
in return the noteholders waive the right to the receipt of any interest after the effective date of august  interest expense in was significantly higher than  at approximately million compared with approximately million in the higher interest expense resulted from the interest incurred on the three convertible notes issued in september  january and july loss from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations decreased to million in from million in the decreased loss was primarily the result of higher thalomid sales and increased revenues from research contracts and collaborative agreements partially offset by higher cost of goods sold  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses and one time merger related costs 
the loss from continuing operations decreased in compared with  to approximately million from approximately million 
the decreased loss resulted from the higher gross profit on thalomid sales and an income tax benefit of million from the sale of a portion of our new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards  offset in part by increased selling  general and administrative costs and higher interest expense 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations of  in resulted from the sale of the chiral intermediates business in january of the company recorded a gain on the sale of the chiral intermediate business of approximately million in liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through private and public sales of our debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities and revenues from research contracts and product sales 
in february  we raised approximately million in a follow on public offering of our common stock 
we also received million in two separate research and license agreements during prior to  we had raised approximately million in net proceeds from three public and three private offerings  including our initial public offering in july we also issued convertible notes in september  january  and july with net proceeds aggregating approximately million 
our net working capital at december  increased significantly to approximately million primarily cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale from approximately million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the cash received from the proceeds of the follow on offering in february  funds received from research and collaborative agreements  as well as collection of receivables on sales of thalomid 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million in from million in while investments in marketable debt securities increased to million in from million in this reflects the receipt of funds from the follow on offering  revenue received from research contracts and collection of receivables from sales of thalomid 
we expect that our rate of spending will increase as the result of research and product development spending at signal  increased clinical trial costs  increased expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products currently in development  increased costs related to the commercialization of thalomid and increased capital investments 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
proceeds from the transaction net of expenses  were approximately million 
these funds  combined with the increasing revenue from sales of thalomid and various research agreements and collaborations are expected to provide sufficient capital for our operations for the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting standards on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
and sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of securities that may include us corporate debt  us government debt  and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in investment grade fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we invest in securities that have a range of maturity dates 
typically  those with a short term maturity are fixed rate  highly liquid  debt instruments and those with longer term maturities are highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates or with periodic interest rate adjustments 
due to the limited number of foreign currency transactions  our foreign exchange currency risk is minimal 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  total fair value in thousands fixed rate        average interest rate at december   our january and july convertible notes with outstanding principal amounts of  and  respectively no longer accrue interest  as disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
these convertible notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price and per share  respectively 
the fair value of fixed interest rate instruments are affected by changes in interest rates and in the case of the convertible notes by changes in the price of the company s common stock
