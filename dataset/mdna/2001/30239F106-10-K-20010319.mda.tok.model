overview we sell universal life  variable universal life  and traditional life insurance and traditional and variable annuity products 
through december   these products were principally marketed through a core distribution force consisting of approximately  exclusive farm bureau agents in midwestern and western states 
on january   our agency force and geographic marketing territory expanded with the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of kansas farm bureau life insurance company  a single state life insurance company selling traditional life and annuity products in the state of kansas 
at december   kansas farm bureau life had exclusive agents and held the largest market share of combined life insurance and annuity business in the state of kansas 
variable universal life and variable annuity products are also marketed in other states through alliances with unaffiliated farm bureau companies 
we also market variable products through alliances with two life insurance companies and a regional broker dealer not affiliated with farm bureau 
several subsidiaries support various functional areas of the life companies and other affiliates  by providing investment advisory  marketing and distribution  and leasing services 
in addition  we manage four farm bureau affiliated property casualty insurance companies 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for interest sensitive products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the life companies receive investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
amounts for interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
for variable universal life and variable annuities  premiums received are not reported as revenues 
similar to universal life and traditional annuities  revenues reported consist of fee income and product charges collected from the policyholders 
expenses related to these products include benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account balances 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life and accident and health insurance products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
for participating traditional life insurance and interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the life companies revise their estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year based on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the life companies is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  morbidity  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
revenues and income from continuing operations are primarily derived from our life insurance segment 
revenues and expenses of our other segments  which consist of investment advisory  marketing and distribution  leasing and management operations  are principally recorded in the other income and other expense line items on the consolidated statements of income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding segment information 
results of operations for the three years ended december  net income totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in net income in is generally attributable to an increase in realized losses on investments  due principally to writedowns for other than temporary impairments in value 
in addition  net investment income decreased due primarily to a decrease in fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls 
these items are partially offset by an increase in equity income 
the increase in net income in is primarily the result of a decrease in realized losses on investments and increased equity income 
these items are offset by an increase in operating expenses relating to the closing of an administrative service center and an increase in the level of operations to support our expanding variable alliances 
in addition  net investment income decreased in due partially to a decrease in fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls 
adjusted operating income  which does not include the impact of realized gains and losses on investments and other items that management believes are not indicative of operating trends  totaled million in  million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income 
year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income    adjustments net realized losses on investments    gain on disposal of property casualty operations  adjusted operating income    earnings per common share assuming dilution adjusted operating earnings per common share assuming dilution the adjustment for realized losses on investments noted in the table above is net of adjustments for that portion of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  unearned revenue reserve  value of insurance in force acquired and income taxes attributable to such gains and losses 
the change in earnings per common share from year to year is positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average common shares outstanding during the three year period ended december  weighted average common shares outstanding  assuming dilution  totaled  in   in and  in these decreases are the result of acquisitions of common stock by the company 
weighted average shares outstanding in will be similarly impacted by the acquisition of  shares during the fourth quarter of our acquisition of the assets and liabilities of kansas farm bureau life on january  impacts our financial position and results of operations 
see kansas farm bureau life insurance company acquisition subsequent event for additional information regarding the acquisition 
effective september   we entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure our individual disability income business with an unaffiliated insurer 
as a result  the consolidated statements of income include the operating results from our individual accident and health business only through august  a loss of million on the coinsurance transaction has been deferred and is being recognized over the term of the underlying policies 
effective september   our agents began to offer a long term disability income product underwritten by one of our variable alliance partners 
we do not share in the risks  costs or profits of the new product  but earn a commission on new sales 
we still have a small block of group long term disability income business that has annualized premiums of approximately million 
a summary of our premiums and product charges is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands premiums and product charges interest sensitive product charges    traditional life insurance premiums    accident and health premiums    total    interest sensitive product charges increased in to million and in to million 
these increases are primarily due to increased cost of insurance charges resulting from an increase in the volume and age of business in force 
in addition  mortality and expense charges have increased as a result of growth in variable product account balances 
surrender charge income increased in to million and decreased in to million as a result of changes in the level of interest sensitive product surrenders 
traditional life insurance premiums increased in to million and in to million 
management believes the modest increase in the sale of traditional life insurance products is the result of a marketing emphasis placed on the sale of variable universal life insurance contracts 
premiums collected on variable universal life insurance products increased to million in and to million in accident and health premiums decreased in to million and increased in to million 
the decrease in is the result of our exit from the individual disability income business effective september  the increase in is primarily the result of the recapture of certain reinsurance ceded business 
net investment income  which excludes investment income on separate account assets relating to variable products  decreased in to million and in to million 
the decreases are attributable to decreases in yield  partially offset by increases in average invested assets 
average invested assets based on assets excluding the impact of recording certain fixed maturity securities at market value totaled  million in   million in and  million in the annualized yield earned on average invested assets was in compared to in and in the yield during and declined due to changing market conditions and a reduction in the amount of prepayment and bond call fee income 
fee income from mortgage loan prepayments and bond calls totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  we recorded million in interest income during relating to the settlement of a fixed maturity security that had been in default 
we had discontinued the accrual of interest on this security during net investment income in will be impacted by our acquisition of  fbl class a common shares for million during the fourth quarter of realized losses on investments increased to million in and decreased to million in realized losses include writedowns of investments that became other than temporarily impaired totaling million in  million in and million in these writedowns are the result of sustained operating losses  defaults on loan payments  declarations of bankruptcy  unsuccessful efforts to raise capital and various other operational or economic factors that became evident in the respective years 
approximately million of the realized losses in were from eight securities that were of investment grade when acquired 
the level of realized gains losses is subject to fluctuation from year to year depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments 
other income decreased in to million and in to million 
the decrease in is primarily due to a decrease in the level of leasing and investment advisory services provided to affiliates and third parties 
the decrease in is primarily due to a decrease in rental income 
a summary of our policy benefits is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands policy benefits interest sensitive products benefits    traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits    increase in traditional life and accident and health future policy benefits    distributions to participating policyholders    total    interest sensitive product benefits increased in to million and in to million 
the components of interest sensitive product benefits  along with selected average contractual interest crediting rates  are as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands interest credited to account balances    death benefits in excess of related account balances    weighted average contractual crediting rates universal life liabilities annuity liabilities the average crediting rate on our product portfolio has been relatively consistent during and however  due to competitive factors  we did increase the crediting rate on our flexible premium deferred annuity in september in addition  we decreased the crediting rate on our universal life contracts in november during we reduced the crediting rate on many of our products  in response to the general decline in market interest rates during that year 
interest sensitive death benefits increased due to an increase in the amount of insurance in force 
interest sensitive death benefits can tend to fluctuate from year to year as a result of mortality experience 
traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits  including the related changes in reserves  increased in to million and in to million 
death and surrender benefits on traditional products increased in to million and in to million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in the change in reserves on life policies 
accident and health benefits  including the related change in reserves  increased in to million and increased in to million 
traditional life insurance and accident and health benefits tend to fluctuate from year to year as a result of changes in mortality and morbidity experience 
as stated above  effective september   all individual disability income benefits are ceded to a third party 
distributions to participating policyholders decreased in to million and in to million 
the decrease for is primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of participating business in force 
the decrease for is principally due to a decrease in the average interest rate used in the dividend formula for these policies 
this average interest rate was at december  and and at december  a summary of our underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses commission expense  net of deferrals    amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs    other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses  net of deferrals    total    commission expense increased in to million and in to million 
commission expense increased during the periods due primarily to an increase in direct life insurance premiums collected 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased in to million and increased in to million 
amortization decreased during due principally to the impact of realized losses on investments backing the related policyholder liabilities 
the increase in is due partly to a shift in product profitability to blocks of business that have a larger acquisition cost remaining to be amortized or that have higher amortization factors 
for both and  amortization increased due to an increase in the unamortized acquisition cost asset due to growth in the volume of business in force 
other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in to million and in to million 
salaries  benefits and other operating expenses increased in and primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with administering our variable product business and developing variable product alliances 
in addition  other information system expenses  agent training and retirement benefit costs increased in compared to other items impacting the comparison of expenses include i restructuring charges of million in and related cost savings in relating to the closing of an administrative service center  ii expenses totaling million in and million in to modify our computer systems to prepare for the year date conversion and iii a credit of million in due to changes in the amounts and timing of estimated guaranty fund assessments 
other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses includes goodwill amortization totaling million in  and see restructuring discussion below 
interest expense increased in to million and in to million due primarily to increases in average debt outstanding 
other expenses decreased in to million and in to million due primarily to a decrease in the level of leasing and investment advisory services provided to affiliates and third parties 
income taxes decreased in to million and in to million 
the effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rates were lower than the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the tax benefit associated with the payment of dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust  tax exempt interest and tax exempt dividend income in  and the impact of these permanent differences  which are relatively consistent from year to year  on the effective tax rate is more significant in due to the decrease in pre tax income 
equity income  net of related income taxes  increased in to million and in to million 
equity income includes our proportionate share of gains and losses attributable to our ownership interest in partnerships  joint ventures and certain companies where we exhibit some control but have a minority ownership interest 
given the timing of availability of financial information from these entities  we will consistently use information that is as much as three months in arrears for certain of these entities 
several of these entities are venture capital investment companies  whose operating results are derived primarily from unrealized and realized gains and losses generated by their investment portfolios 
the income in is primarily driven by unrealized appreciation on two internet related equity securities owned by two of these venture capital investment companies 
a substantial portion of the positions held by the equity investees in these two entities was distributed to us and subsequently sold during as is normal with these types of entities  the level of these gains and losses is subject to fluctuation from period to period depending on the prevailing economic environment  changes in prices of equity securities held by the investment partnerships  timing and success of initial public offerings and other exit strategies  and the timing of the sale of investments held by the partnerships and joint ventures 
equity income includes goodwill amortization totaling million in  and restructuring we closed an administrative service center during july and merged two life insurance subsidiaries effective july  as a result of the closing of the service center  a leased property was vacated  job positions were eliminated and moving costs were incurred 
during  we charged to expense costs totaling million for related severance benefits  lease costs and other costs primarily associated with closing the service center 
discontinued operations we recorded a gain of million in  million in and million in  net of related income taxes  on the sale of utah farm bureau insurance company utah insurance  a former wholly owned property casualty insurance company  to farm bureau mutual insurance company farm bureau mutual  an affiliate 
in addition  during the increase in net unrealized appreciation on securities classified as available for sale was reduced million  net of related income taxes  as a result of the sale 
the gain on the sale may be increased in future years in accordance with an earn out provision included in the related sales agreement 
see liquidity fbl financial group  inc income from discontinued operations totaled million for and revenues from discontinued operations totaled million through the date of sale in kansas farm bureau life insurance company acquisition subsequent event revenues  benefits and expenses will increase in as a result of our acquisition of the assets and liabilities of kansas farm bureau life insurance company 
as a privately held company  kansas farm bureau life did not prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  historical gaap financial statements and pro forma results assuming the acquisition on a historical basis are not available 
net income  based on statutory accounting principles  totaled million in  million in and million in we believe the acquisition will be slightly accretive to earnings per share in the acquisition will be accounted for using purchase accounting 
a condensed statement of the assets and liabilities acquired as of january   on a gaap basis  is as follows dollars in thousands assets liabilities and stockholder s equity investments  policy liabilities and investments  value of insurance in force acquired 
 other policyholder funds  goodwill other goodwill  other assets  total liabilities  stockholder s equity  total  total  as consideration for the purchase  we issued  shares of series c cumulative voting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with an estimated fair value of million 
each share of series c preferred stock has a par value of and voting rights identical to that of class a common stock 
dividends on the series c preferred stock are payable quarterly at a rate equal to the common stock dividend per share then payable 
the mandatory redemption is structured so that of the series c preferred stock will be redeemed at par value  or million  on january  with the remaining redeemed at par value  or million  on january  in the event of a change in the control of the company  at the option of the holder  each share of series c preferred stock is convertible into one share of class a common stock or redeemable for cash at par 
the series c preferred stock was issued at an million discount to par 
this discount will accrete to preferred stock dividends during the life of the securities using the effective interest method 
the effective cost of capital is approximately 
acquisition costs totaling million have been deferred and are included as a component of goodwill 
financial condition investments our total investment portfolio decreased to  million at december  compared to  million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of i the acquisition of our common stock  ii a million net payment for reserves pursuant to the individual disability income coinsurance arrangement  iii net cash outflows on interest sensitive and variable products and iv an increase in writedowns on other than temporarily impaired securities 
these items were partially offset by positive cash flow from operations and a decrease in net unrealized depreciation on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale 
over the last several years  the mix of our life insurance business has been shifting from traditional and interest sensitive products to variable products 
in addition  we have an exchange program for the rollover of universal life policies to variable universal life policies 
we expect the shift to variable products to continue due to this program and the continued popularity of variable products 
a majority of premiums received on variable products are typically invested in our separate accounts as opposed to the general account investments 
this trend is expected to impact the future growth rate of our investment portfolio and separate account assets 
internal investment professionals manage our investment portfolio 
the investment strategy is designed to achieve superior risk adjusted returns consistent with the investment philosophy of maintaining a largely investment grade portfolio and providing adequate liquidity for obligations to policyholders and other requirements 
we continually review the returns on invested assets and change the mix of invested assets as deemed prudent under the current market environment to help maximize current income 
our investment portfolio is summarized in the table below december  carrying carrying carrying value percent value percent value percent dollars in thousands fixed maturities public    a private placement    private placement    total fixed maturities    equity securities    mortgage loans on real estate    investment real estate acquired for debt  investment    policy loans    other long term investments    short term investments    total investments    as of december   based on carrying value of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade debt securities  defined as being in the highest two national association of insurance commissioners naic designations 
non investment grade debt securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers 
in addition  the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for investment grade debt securities 
we regularly review the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in non investment grade debt securities naic designations through 
as of december   the investment in non investment grade debt was of fixed maturity securities 
at that time no single non investment grade holding exceeded of total investments 
the following table sets forth the credit quality  by naic designation and standard poors s p rating equivalents  of fixed maturity securities

   total fixed maturities    private placement securities are generally rated by the securities valuation office of the naic 
comparisons between naic designations and s p ratings are published by the naic 
s p has not rated some of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
mortgage and other asset backed securities constitute a significant portion of our portfolio of securities 
these securities were purchased at a time when we believed these types of investments provided superior risk adjusted returns compared to returns of more conventional investments such as corporate bonds and mortgage loans 
these securities are diversified as to collateral types  cash flow characteristics and maturity 
the return of principal on mortgage and other asset backed securities occurs more frequently and is more variable than that of more traditional fixed maturity securities 
the principal prepayment speeds eg  the rate of individuals refinancing their home mortgages can vary based on a number of economic factors that can not be predicted with certainty 
these factors include the prevailing interest rate environment and general status of the economy 
deviations in actual prepayment speeds from that originally expected can cause a change in the yield earned on mortgage and asset backed securities purchased at a premium or discount 
increases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in a decreasing interest rate environment  generally increases the rate at which discount is accrued and premium is amortized into income 
decreases in prepayment speeds  which typically occur in an increasing interest rate environment  generally slows down the rate these amounts are recorded into income 
the mortgage backed portfolio includes pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities 
with a pass through security  we receive a pro rata share of principal payments as payments are made on the underlying mortgage loans 
cmos consist of pools of mortgages divided into sections or tranches which provide sequential retirement of the bonds 
we invest in sequential tranches  which provide cash flow stability in that principal payments do not occur until the previous tranches are paid off 
in addition  to provide call protection and more stable average lives  we invest in cmos such as planned amortization class pac and targeted amortization class tac securities 
cmos of these types provide more predictable cash flows within a range of prepayment speeds by shifting the prepayment risks to support tranches 
we do not purchase certain types of collateralized mortgage obligations that we believe would subject the investment portfolio to greater than average risk 
these include  but are not limited to  interest only  principal only  floater  inverse floater  pac ii  z and support tranches 
the following table sets forth the par value  amortized cost and carrying value of our mortgage and asset backed securities at december   summarized by type of security 
percent amortized carrying of fixed cost par value value maturities dollars in thousands residential mortgage backed securities sequential    pass through    planned and targeted amortization class    other    total residential mortgage backed securities    commercial mortgage backed securities    other asset backed securities    total mortgage and asset backed securities    the commercial and other asset backed securities are primarily sequential securities 
commercial mortgage backed securities typically have cash flows that are less sensitive to interest rate changes than residential securities of similar types due principally to prepayment restrictions on many of the underlying commercial mortgage loans 
other asset backed securities are principally mortgage related manufactured housing and home equity loans which historically have also demonstrated relatively less cash flow volatility than residential securities of similar types 
at december   we held million or of invested assets in mortgage loans 
these mortgage loans are diversified as to property type  location and loan size  and are collateralized by the related properties 
at december   mortgages more than days delinquent accounted for less than of the carrying value of the mortgage portfolio 
our mortgage lending policies establish limits on the amount that can be loaned to one borrower and require diversification by geographic location and collateral type 
regions with the largest concentration of our mortgage loan portfolio at december  include pacific  which includes california  and west south central  which includes oklahoma and texas 
mortgage loans on real estate are also diversified by collateral type with office buildings and retail facilities representing the largest holdings at december  other assets securities and indebtedness of related parties decreased to million at december  due primarily to distributions from equity investees and unrealized depreciation on fixed maturity securities owned by an equity investee 
these items were partially offset by the impact of equity income on the securities and indebtedness balance during reinsurance recoverable increased to million at december  due principally to the reinsurance of our individual disability income business 
deferred policy acquisition costs increased in to million 
this increase is due to the capitalization of costs incurred with new sales  partially offset by amortization and an million decrease resulting from the reinsurance of our individual disability income business 
assets held in separate accounts increased  to million at december  due primarily to net transfers to the separate accounts resulting from sales of our variable products 
at december   we had total assets of  million  a increase from total assets at december  liabilities policy liabilities and accruals decreased to  million at december  the slight decrease in policy liabilities is partially attributable to our marketing emphasis on the sale of variable products 
as noted under the investments section above  the shift in sales to variable products will have an impact on the future growth rate of our policy liabilities and accruals as well as the separate account liabilities 
in addition  future policy benefit reserves on interest sensitive products decreased due to an increase in surrender benefits during other liabilities decreased to million at december  due primarily to a decrease in payables for investment securities purchased 
at december   we had total liabilities of  million  a increase from total liabilities at december  stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased  to million at december   compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to stock repurchases and dividends paid  offset  in part  by net income and a change in net unrealized investment gains losses 
at december   common stockholders equity was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share at december  included in stockholders equity per common share is at december  and at december  attributable to unrealized investment gains losses resulting from marking our fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale to market value 
the change in unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale increased stockholders equity million during  after related adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired  unearned revenue reserve and deferred income taxes 
market risks of financial instruments interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of insurance products and market value of investments 
the yield realized on new investments generally increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
the market value of our fixed maturity and mortgage loan portfolios generally increases when interest rates decrease  and decreases when interest rates increase 
a majority of our insurance liabilities are backed by fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
the fixed maturity securities have laddered maturities and a weighted average life of years at december  and years at december  accordingly  the earned rate on the portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
the extent that the portfolio yield lags behind changes in market yields generally depends upon the following factors the average life of the portfolio 
the amount and speed at which market interest rates rise or fall 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities accelerate during periods of declining interest rates 
the amount by which bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and paydowns on mortgage and asset backed securities decelerate during periods of increasing interest rates 
for a majority of our traditional insurance products  profitability is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
for variable products  profitability on the portion of the policyholder s account balance invested in our general account  if any  is also affected by the spreads earned 
the variable policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for a substantial portion of our business in force  we have the ability to adjust interest or dividend crediting rates in reaction to changes in portfolio yield 
we had the ability to adjust rates on of our liabilities at december  and of our liabilities at december  however  the ability to adjust these rates is limited by competitive factors 
surrender rates could increase and new sales could be negatively impacted if the crediting rates are not competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other insurance companies and financial service institutions 
in addition  if market rates were to decrease substantially and stay at a low level for an extended period of time  our spread could be lowered due to interest rate guarantees on many of our interest sensitive products 
at december  and  interest rate guarantees on interest sensitive products ranged from to 
the weighted average guarantee was at december  and we design our products and manage our investment portfolio in a manner to encourage persistency and to help ensure targeted spreads are earned 
in addition to the ability to change interest crediting rates on our products  certain interest sensitive contracts have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions 
the following is a summary of the surrender and discretionary withdrawal characteristics of our interest sensitive products and supplementary contracts without life contingencies reserve balance at december  dollars in thousands surrender charge rate greater than or equal to   less than  but still subject to surrender charge   not subject to surrender charge   not subject to surrender or discretionary withdrawal   total   a major component of our asset liability management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities 
we use computer models to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from existing insurance policies under various interest rate scenarios 
information from these models is used in the determination of interest crediting rates and investment strategies 
effective duration is a common measure for price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it measures the approximate percentage change in the market value of a portfolio when interest rates change by basis points 
this measure includes the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as bond calls and prepayments 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is reduced because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
the effective duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was approximately at december  and at december  the effective duration of the interest sensitive products was approximately at december  and at december  if interest rates were to increase from levels at december  and  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments would decrease approximately million at december  and million at december  this hypothetical change in value does not take into account any offsetting change in the value of insurance liabilities for investment contracts since we estimate such value to be the cash surrender value of the underlying contracts 
if interest rates were to decrease from levels at december  and  the fair value of our debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary trust would increase million at december  and million at december  the computer models used to estimate the impact of a change in market interest rates use many assumptions and estimates that materially impact the fair value calculations 
key assumptions used by the models include an immediate and parallel shift in the yield curve and an acceleration of bond calls and principal prepayments on mortgage and other asset backed securities 
the above estimates do not attempt to measure the financial statement impact on the resulting change in deferred policy acquisition costs  value of insurance in force acquired  unearned revenue reserves and income taxes 
due to the subjectivity of these assumptions  the actual impact of a change in rates on the fair market values would likely be different from that estimated 
equity price risk is not material to us due to the relatively small equity portfolio held at december  however  we do earn investment management fees on those investments managed by us and mortality and expense fee income based on the value of our separate accounts 
on an annualized basis  the investment management fee rates range from to for and the mortality and expense fee rates range from to for and as a result  revenues from these sources do fluctuate with changes in the market value of the equity  fixed maturity and other securities held by the separate accounts

parent company cash inflows from operations consists primarily of i dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  ii fees which it charges the various subsidiaries and affiliates for management of their operations  iii expense reimbursements from subsidiaries and affiliates and iv tax settlements between the parent company and its subsidiaries 
cash outflows are principally for salaries and other expenses related to providing these management services  dividends on outstanding stock and interest on our holding company debt issued to a subsidiary 
in addition  our parent company will on occasion enter into capital transactions such as the acquisition of our common stock

in addition  it is anticipated that dividends from farm bureau life will be used to fund the scheduled redemption of the series c preferred stock in million and million 
the ability of farm bureau life to pay dividends to fbl financial group  inc is limited by law to earned profits statutory unassigned surplus as of the date the dividend is paid  as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities of the state of iowa 
in addition  under the iowa insurance holding company act  farm bureau life may not pay an extraordinary dividend without prior notice to and approval by the iowa insurance commissioner
