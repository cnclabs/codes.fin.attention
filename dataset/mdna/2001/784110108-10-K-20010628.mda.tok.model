professional services revenues  consisting of consulting  training  and legacy system transformation services fees  were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
most of our revenues in the first three quarters of fiscal were derived from sales of year products and solutions  and the decreases experienced were a result of the rapid decline in worldwide demand for year solutions immediately following december  since that date  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from sales of our web enablement and legacy system transformation solutions collectively  e business solutions 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of software license and maintenance fees and cost of professional services

our total cost of revenues was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in cost of revenues was associated with the decline in revenues  as discussed above 
this decline was partially offset by increased costs related to web enablement and legacy transformation products and services 
total costs of revenues did not decrease in the same proportion as did revenues between periods  primarily due to the inherent costs of under utilized professional staff 
cost of software license and maintenance fees includes the expenses for providing customer support services  royalties  third party software sold  and  to a lesser degree  the expenses of media  manuals  duplication and shipping related to sales of certain of our software products

costs of temporary or subcontracted labor may also be included  if such labor is required to meet the demands of providing services 
professional services costs were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in personnel costs  both in house and subcontracted  and is related to the decline in demand for year related services  which was partially offset by an increase in demand for services related to e business solutions 
due to the under utilization of professional staff  total costs of professional services did not decrease at the same rate as services revenues between periods

the gross margin percentages for software license and maintenance fees are impacted by the proportion of customer support services costs to the amount of software license and maintenance fees generated in a given period 
also  these percentages fluctuate depending on the mix of software products and the varying royalty expenses  if any  associated with those products 
the gross margin percentage for software license and maintenance fees was lower in fiscal than in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in these fees  which declined by a proportionately greater percentage than the decrease in customer support costs 
the gross margin percentages for professional services vary depending on the utilization rates for billable consultants  the timing and amount of costs incurred for recruiting and training services consultants  and the type of services provided

income taxes 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded for fiscal  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
no income tax provision or benefit was recorded for fiscal in fiscal and  we calculated a net deferred tax asset  which was offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realization of our net operating loss carryforwards

impact of inflation increases in the inflation rate are not expected to materially affect our operating results 
inflationary cost increases have not been material in recent years  and to the extent allowed in light of competitive pressures  such increases are passed on to customers through increased billing rates 
foreign currency translation the overall effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our business during the periods discussed have not been material 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates create a degree of risk to our operations if those movements affect the dollar value of costs incurred in foreign currencies 
the majority of our billings to date have been denominated in us dollars 
changing currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position if exchange rate changes impact profitability and business and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date 
expenses are translated using the average exchange rate during the period 
seasonality our operations are not affected by seasonal fluctuations 
our cash flows may at times fluctuate due to the timing of cash receipts from large individual sales 
other in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities and requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for years beginning after june  to date  we have not engaged in derivative and hedging activities  and accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin primarily clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock option awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
the application of fin did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalent investments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  floating rate instruments that carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these instruments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
conversely  if interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income investments will likely be negatively impacted 
foreign currency risk 
as of march   we had operating subsidiaries located in the united kingdom and india 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
we maintain only nominal foreign currency cash balances  consisting of working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries 
at march  we did not hold any material foreign denominated financial instruments or contracts  and we have not entered into foreign currency hedge transactions 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial position or results of operations has not been  and is not expected to be  material in the foreseeable future
