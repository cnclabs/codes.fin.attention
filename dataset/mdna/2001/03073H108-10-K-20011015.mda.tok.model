general ameritrans acquired elk in december   and to date we have had no activities other than the acquisition and operation of elk 
elk is an sbic that has been operating since  making loans to and  to a limited extent  investments in small businesses  primarily businesses that are majority owned by persons who qualify under sba regulations as socially or economically disadvantaged 
most of elk s business has consisted of originating and servicing loans collateralized by new york city  boston  chicago and miami taxi medallions  but elk also makes loans to and investments in other diversified businesses and to persons who qualify under sba regulations as non disadvantaged 
historically  elk s earnings derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets consisting of business loans  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities consisting of indebtedness to elk s banks and subordinated debentures issued to the sba 
net interest income is a function of the net interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
unrealized depreciation on loans and investments is recorded when elk adjusts the value of a loan to reflect management s estimate of the fair value  as approved by the board of directors 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income decreased by  to  for the year ended june   when compared with the year ended june  the decrease was due to a decrease in interest earned on the loan portfolio of  combined with a decrease in fees and other income of  this decrease reflects the leveling of the company s portfolio which occurred during its merger discussions with medallion 
operating expenses interest expense increased by  to  when compared with the prior year due to increased interest rates during the beginning of the fiscal year combined with increased average outstanding loan balance during the year 
other operating expenses decreased to  for the year ended june   as compared with  in the prior year due to a slowdown of chicago medallion loan deals 
bad debt expense decreased  to  during the year ended june   as compared with the year ended june  during the year ended june  the company expensed costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger with medallion financial corp 
in the amount of  these costs were non operational and a one time charge 
net income net income ended june   increased  to  this increase was mainly due to decreased bad debt write offs of  and a one time write off of merger costs of  as compared with prior year other expense charge offs of  results of operation for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income increased by  to  for the year ended june   when compared with the year ended june  the increased was due to an increase in interest earned on the loan portfolio of  plus an increase in other fees and income of  this reflects elk s decision to maximize stockholders return by maximizing the use of bank financing

combined with the slowdown of the us economy 
the company reduced bank debt during the year by  asset liability management interest rate sensitivity ameritrans  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans rise or fall at a different rate over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of its credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from ameritrans interest rate sensitivity gap ie the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
ameritrans interest rate sensitive assets were million and interest rate sensitive liabilities were million at june  having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  ameritrans anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
ameritrans believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
interest rate cap agreements ameritrans manages the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
on january   the company entered into a  interest rate swap transaction with a bank expiring on october  on june   the company entered into an additional interest rate swap transaction with the same bank for  expiring on june  on june   the company entered into another interest rate swap transaction for  with this bank expiring june  these swap transactions were entered into to protect the company from an upward movement in interest rates relating to outstanding bank debt see note for terms and effective interest rates 
these swap transactions call for a fixed rate of  and  respectively plus basis points for the company and if the floating one month libor rate is below the fixed rate then the company is obligated to pay the bank for the difference in rates 
when the one month libor rate is above the fixed rate then the bank is obligated to pay the company for the differences in rates 
the effective fixed costs on the debt that was swapped  including the basis points  is  and respectively 
ameritrans believes that its bank credit facilities and cash flow from operations after distributions to stockholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio 
nevertheless  the company continues to explore additional options  which may increase available funds for its growth and expansion strategy 
in addition  to the application for sba funding described above  these financing options would provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
we are working with investment banking firms to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include an equity offering of securities 
investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the differences between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions  or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through private placements of its securities  bank financing  and the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures 
during january  elk completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of  less offering expenses of  the net proceeds were utilized to repay bank indebtedness and for working capital 
a portion of the proceeds temporarily use to reduce bank indebtedness  up to a maximum of  was allocated by elk toward the organization and capitalization of its then new parent company  ameritrans 
at june   of elk s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks and by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest ranging form to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba  and the availability of funds 
in addition  elk is presently eligible to apply for additional leverage from the sba if it is determined by the board of directors to be in the best interests of the company 
no assurance can be given that  if applied for  such additional financing will be approved by the sba 
our sources of liquidity are credit lines with banks  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayment 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms
