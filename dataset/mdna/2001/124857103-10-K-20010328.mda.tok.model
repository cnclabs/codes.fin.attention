operating results derived from the company s motion picture and television production fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public  which are difficult to predict 
motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent and other factors have resulted in higher production costs 
in addition  the commercial success of the company s motion picture and television productions also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions  and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities 

the company s operating results also fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases  as well as a result of the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition
