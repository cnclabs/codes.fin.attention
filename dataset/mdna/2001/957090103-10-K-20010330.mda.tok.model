net income the company achieved earnings of million in  representing a percent increase from the million earned in  which was up percent over earnings of million 
components of net income in millions net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense taxes net income net income as a percentage of average total assets average total assets    fully taxable equivalent fte diluted earnings per share in were  compared to and in and  respectively 
much of the improvement in current year s earnings is the result of higher net interest income  which grew by million or compared to approximately two thirds of that increase was due to higher levels of earning assets and the remainder to a a higher net interest margin 
in addition the loan loss provision was reduced by million  noninterest income grew thousand and noninterest expense grew slightly 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of first counties bank  an institution with total assets of million headquartered in clearlake  california 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
earnings in increased million over  due to increased noninterest income  a reduction in noninterest expense reflective of continued expense controls  a lower loan loss provision and a slight increase in net interest income 
the increase in net interest income was due to higher average earning asset balances offset by a lower net interest margin 
the company s return on average total assets was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
return on average equity in was percent  compared to percent and percent in the two previous years 
net interest income the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income fte in increased million from to million 
comparing to  net interest income fte increased thousand 
components of net interest income in millions interest income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte net interest margin fte interest income fte increased million from to  primarily due to higher level of earning assets 
average loans outstanding grew million to billion  the results of an million expansion of the commercial real estate loan portfolio plus million in consumer loans  offset by decreases in commercial and residential real estate loans which declined million and million respectively 
partially offsetting the growth in loans  average investments declined million 
in addition to the net positive earning asset volume variance  the average rate earned on these assets also increased 
yields on loans grew from in to in while investments yields improved basis points to 
overall  the yield on the company s earning assets increased from in to in interest income fte decreased million from to primarily due to a basis point decrease in earning asset yields  a combination of a basis point lower yield and a basis point decrease in the investment yield 
these changes were reflective of a general decline in market rates  resulting in all categories of loan and investment securities yields being lower than prior year 
partially offsetting these changes  average earning asset balances increased million from  with loan and investment securities average balances increasing million an million  respectively from interest expense increased million or in due to the higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in the average rate paid was while in it increased to 
the largest individual increase was the rate paid on public time deposits  which grew by in to in another large contributor to the higher average rate was federal funds purchased  the rate on which increased from to 
partially offsetting these higher rates  the volume of interest bearing liabilities decreased during the year by million or 
the lower interest bearing liabilities were replaced by noninterest bearing transaction deposits  which grew million 
interest expense decreased by million in compared to this was the result of a decrease of basis points in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with a million increase in the average balance of interest free demand deposits  in part offset by a million increase in the interest bearing liabilities average balances 
summary of average balances  yields rates and interest differential the following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields  and the amount of interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the company held million classified as investments available for sale

asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and increase diversification of earning assets 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all non performing assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following summarizes the company s classified assets for the periods indicated in millions at december  classified loans other classified assets total classified assets classified loans at december  decreased million or percent to million from december   continuing to reflect the effectiveness of the company s high underwriting standards and active workout policies 
other classified assets decreased million from prior year  due to sales and writedowns of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt partially offset by new foreclosures on loans with real estate collateral 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonperforming assets 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
performing nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated in millions december  performing nonaccrual loans nonperforming nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans restructured loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming assets performing nonaccrual loans at december  were unchanged from the prior year while nonperforming nonaccrual loans decreased million during the same period 
both categories were affected by extensive activity during the year  most loans that were on nonaccrual status at december   either were paid off or returned to full accrual status  while others were added to replace them 
the million decrease in other real estate owned balances from december  was due to writedowns and liquidations net of foreclosures 
the increase in nonaccrual loans from to was primarily due to the addition of one large group of related credits  offset by other reductions 
the decrease in other real estate owned balances at december from december  was due to writedowns and liquidations net of foreclosures the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period  was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared to thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  the total nonperforming assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming asset levels  however  no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based upon specific conditions  credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the allowance is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and numerous accounts are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
a portion of the allowance is also allocated to impaired loans 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which constituted percent of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
however  while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans on which the loss is considered probable  the risk exists of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future allowance levels 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated in thousands total loans outstanding      average loans outstanding during the period      analysis of the reserve beginning balance      additions to the reserve charged to operating expense      allowance acquired through merger   credit losses commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction real estate residential  consumer      total      credit loss recoveries commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction real estate residential consumer      total      net credit losses      balance  end of period      net credit losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december for the years indicated loans loans loans loans loans allocation as allocation as allocation as allocation as allocation as of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total reserve of total reserve of total balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans dollars and thousands commercial      real estate construction      real estate residential  consumer      unallocated portion of the reserve      total      the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated in thousands at december  nonaccrual loans   other   total impaired loans   specific reserves   the million balance of impaired loans as of december   other than nonaccrual loans  is due to one commercial real estate loan having collateral exposure that may preclude ultimate full repayment 
payment on this credit was current as of december  the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the amount of that recorded investment for which there is no related allowance for credit losses was in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructurings or loans that are classified as nonaccrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may increase the company s interest rate risk position in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a flat interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling rate scenario  where the federal funds rate  serving as a driver  is made to rise or fall evenly by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
company policy requires that such simulated changes in nii should always be less than percent or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
according to the same policy  if the simulated changes in nii reach percent  a closer inspection of the risk will be put in place to determine what steps could be taken to control risk 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in nii  based on the month period ending december  changes in estimated increase interest decrease in nii rates estimated basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  repricing within days non over repricing total assets investment securities  loans   other assets total assets   liabilities non interest bearing   interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings debt financing and notes payable other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity    net liabilities assets subject to repricing  cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing   the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturity  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitivity loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the company s principal source of liquidity is its operating activities 
the company s profitability in   and generated substantial cash flows of million  million and million respectively 
the company s investing activities were also a net source of cash in proceeds from maturing investment securities of million were only partially reinvested  for a net increase in cash of million 
much of this cash was consumed by net disbursements of loans  which amounted to million during this year 
other investing activities contributed million 
however  investing activities were net users of cash in and net disbursement of loans were million in and  in addition  the company increased its investment securities  portfolio by million primarily in us agencies and municipal securities  partially offset by decreases in us treasury and asset backed securities 
net disbursements of loans were million in  which were partially funded by a reduction in investment securities of million 
during the company used cash in connection with its financing activities 
short term borrowings and notes payable were reduced by million  and million was disbursed for the purchase and retirement of capital stock 
a third significant use of cash was the payment of o million in shareholder dividends 
much of the combined million in cash used in financing activities was replaced by million in additional deposits 
financing activities were a net source of cash in the effect of the company s stock repurchase program and dividends paid to shareholders of million  and million  respectively  in addition to million decrease in customers deposits and the repayment of million in long term debt and debt financing  was offset by an increase of million in short term borrowings 
the combination of these factors resulted in a total of million in net cash provided by financing activities during conversely  during  customers deposits increased million and stock issued primarily for stock option exercises totaled million  but these cash inflows were offset by cash used by the company for its share repurchase program and other retirement of stock activities  totaling million  dividends paid to the company s shareholders for million and reductions in short term borrowings and debt financing in the amounts of million and million respectively 
the company anticipates increasing its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand of loans will continue to increase moderately  and that share repurchases continue 
the growth of deposit balances is expected to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company annually repurchases approximately million of its shares of common stock in the open market with the intention of lessening the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet employee stock awards  option plans  and other ongoing requirements 
in addition to these systematic repurchases  other programs have been implemented to optimize the company s use of equity capital and enhance shareholder value 
pursuant to these programs  the company repurchased an additional thousand shares in  million in and million and the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or percent from the previous year end and decreased million or percent from december  the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  tier i risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  capital to risk adjusted assets minimum regulatory capital at december  requirements tier i capital total capital leverage ratio capital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the company s future needs 
all ratios are in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized

in addition public and jumbo cds went up by million with a corresponding reduction in consumer cds of million during  total average deposits increased million or percent from primarily due to aggressive policies in place resulting in a combined increase of million in demand deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts 
the increase of million in non interest bearing demand deposits was partially offset by million decrease in interest bearing transaction accounts 
the following sets forth  by time remaining to maturity  the company s domestic time deposits in amounts of thousand or more at december  in thousands three months or less  over three through six months  over six through twelve months  over twelve months total  short term borrowings the following table sets forth the short term borrowings of the company for the periods indicated in thousands at december  federal funds purchased    other borrowed funds retail repurchase agreements    other    total other borrowed funds    total funds purchased    further detail of the other borrowed funds is as follows in thousands at december  outstanding average for the year    maximum during the year    interest rates average for the year average at period end noninterest income components of noninterest income in millions service charges on deposit accounts merchant credit card financial services commissions debit card fees mortgage banking trust fees other total noninterest income increased thousand or in  primarily due to higher deposit service charges  specifically those related to customer overdrafts and items returned due to insufficient funds 
those categories benefited from revised service charge calculation methodologies implemented in late using a process of price escalators determined by volume by customer 
service charges generated from users of the company s debit card product introduced in  grew from thousand to million 
merchant credit card income grew by or thousand due to expanding sales volume 
the other category included a million litigation settlement in that did not recur in  the decline was largely offset by increases in gains on sale of foreclosed property  atm surcharge income and revenue from the sale of official checks 
financial services commissions were high in due to fees earned upon one time product conversions 
noninterest income was million in  million higher than financial services commissions were million higher than due to more aggressive marketing efforts resulting in higher sales volume on all products  including annuities  securities and life insurance 
merchant credit card income was thousand higher than  mainly due to fee restructuring and higher sales volume  service charges on deposit accounts were thousand higher than in as a result of higher fees from overdraft and non sufficient funds returned items  and trust fees were thousand higher than in a litigation settlement of million accounted for the majority of the increases in other noninterest income category 
partially offsetting these increases from prior year  mortgage banking income was thousand lower than in  due to declining service income  lower gains on sales of loans in the secondary market and lower banking fees due to reduced refinancing volume 
noninterest expense components of noninterest expense in millions salaries other personnel benefits occupancy equipment data processing contact courier amortization of intangible assets telephone postage professional fees stationery and supplies merchant credit card processing advertising and public relations loan expenses operational losses other total average full time equivalent staff    noninterest expense to revenues efficiency ratio fte noninterest expense increased by less than thousand in compared to  resulting in a further improvement in the company s efficiency ratio to 
the largest category of increase was personnel related costs 
on a percentage basis the thousand change in personnel related costs equated to a nominal 
the growth was the net effect of merit increases to employees and one time severance costs incurred in connection with the company s acquisition of first counties bank in august  partially reduced by fewer number of employees and lower incentives 
the next largest increase was the amortization of intangible assets created in connection with certain acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
the thousand increase in amortization resulted from the first counties bank acquisition 
contract courier expense grew thousand  as the company continued its strategy of providing courier services to an increased number of business clients 
professional fees increased thousand primarily in connection with legal costs incurred as a result of the first counties bank acquisition 
merchant credit card processing grew thousand or  consistent with the revenue growth discussed above 
offsetting these increases  occupancy costs dropped thousand or 
the primary cause of the decrease was the expiration of a long term lease commitment for office space assumed in connection with a acquisition 
equipment expense  which consists largely of depreciation charges  decreased thousand or as certain technology assets purchased in the mid s became fully amortized 
postage costs decreased thousand  as the company took advantage of more efficient methods for distributing customer statements and notices 
loan expenses declined thousand 
operational losses were lower by thousand as was not affected by any unusually large individual losses  unlike prior years 
noninterest expense decreased million in compared to professional fees were thousand lower than  including lower legal fees  primarily due to reduced problem credit related expenses  and lower accounting costs primarily due to a reduced number of special projects undertaken in  equipment expenses were thousand lower than prior year primarily due to lower depreciation costs and lower lease and maintenance expenses resulting from contract renegotiations  and the cost of other personnel benefits was thousand lower than primarily due to reduced expenses related to some of the company s compensation plans
