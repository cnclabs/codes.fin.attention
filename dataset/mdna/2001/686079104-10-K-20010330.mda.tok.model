to achieve these goals  the company is developing additional product offerings and extending its market penetration from the western united states to a national marketing presence 
the company s operating results were negatively affected for by  among other things  a lack of industry wide demand for welded pipe products 
as a consequence  the company shifted its sales and marketing efforts to specialty and commodity steel plate products  which  while maintaining total overall shipment levels near prior years  led to significant decreases in sales revenues realized for the specialty and commodity plate markets have been impacted by both new sources of domestic supply and continued imports from foreign suppliers  which has adversely affected average selling prices for the company s plate products 
high fixed costs motivate steel producers to maintain high output levels even in the face of falling prices  thereby increasing further downward pressures on selling prices 
the domestic steel industry and the company s business are highly cyclical in nature and these factors and others have adversely affected the profitability of the company 
the company expects pricing pressure to continue in most of its product lines into the foreseeable future 
while demand for the company s plate and large diameter pipe products is improving  pricing remains depressed 
rail production is also expected to be down from the prior year due to customer cutbacks in rail procurement 
in addition  high natural gas prices are expected to have a negative impact on the cost of production of the company s steel mills in the first quarter of as the year progresses  the company expects to see improved pricing and volume in plate  dsaw pipe and erw pipe products and declining natural gas costs 
as a result  the company anticipates that net losses will continue in the first quarter  and expects to approach break even in the second quarter of and achieve profitability in the second half of the year 
these results are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially 
the company expects to ship approximately million tons of product during the oregon steel division anticipates that it will ship more than  tons of welded pipe shipments and approximately  tons of plate and coil products during if these levels are realized  welded pipe shipments will have increased significantly from the  tons shipped in due to the then weaker market conditions for large diameter welded pipe 
the rmsm division anticipates that it will ship approximately  tons of rail in light of the railroads procurement cutbacks and around  tons of rod  bar  and semifinished products 
strong demand for all otcg products  including seamless pipe  is envisioned for the entire year  and the rmsm division expects to ship at least  tons of seamless pipe during the year

also  the average gross profit per ton for the company s plate products was reduced due to declining average selling prices for as compared to offsetting these decreases was improved average margins for the company s rod and bar products  as the company was able to sell a greater percentage of specialty rod products for as compared to the effect of restarting the seamless mill also mitigated the decrease in gross profit  as the seamless mill was reopened with minimal start up costs in  as opposed to the significant shutdown and severance costs incurred in when operation of the mill was suspended 
settlement of litigation 
the company recorded a million gain for from litigation settlements with various graphite electrode suppliers 
selling  general and administrative

the oregon steel division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products at an average selling price per ton of for compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of for the increased shipments were the result of a percent increase in plate and coil shipments and a percent increase in pipe shipments 
the decline in average selling price of percent results primarily from the decline in prices for plate products  the decrease in the percentage of higher priced welded pipe products and a decrease in the canadian welded pipe products average selling price 
the average selling price for plate declined percent for primarily due to the high levels of imported steel plate 
see part i business competition and other market factors 
the division s plate mill produced  tons of plate and coil products during compared to  during the rmsm division shipped  tons at an average selling price per ton of for compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of for the percent decline in total shipments for is the result of reduced rail  seamless pipe and semi finished product shipments partially offset by increased rod and bar shipments 
in may of  the division suspended its seamless pipe operations due to poor market conditions 
lower rail shipments for were the result of reduced domestic demand for rail products 
gross profits 
gross profit was percent for compared to percent for gross profit was favorably affected by higher shipments of welded pipe products and lower manufacturing costs for plate and welded pipe products  due in part to improved production from the combination mill 
the favorable costs for plate and welded pipe products were partially offset by the lower average selling prices noted previously  by losses in the seamless pipe business for  and by the subsequent shutdown and severance costs incurred in the temporary closure of the seamless pipe mill

net working capital at december  increased million compared to december   reflecting a million increase in current assets offset by a million increase in current liabilities

despite the unfavorable operating results for  the company has been able to fulfill its needs for working capital and capital expenditures  due in part on its ability to secure adequate financing arrangements 
the company expects that operations will continue for  with the realization of assets  and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that its prospective needs for working capital and capital expenditures will be met from cash flows generated by operations and borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement 
if operations are not consistent with management s plans  there is no assurance that the amounts from these sources will be sufficient for such purposes 
in that event  or for other reasons  the company may be required to seek alternative financing arrangements 
there is no assurance that such sources of financing will be available if required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company s level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that the company and its subsidiaries may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on their indebtedness when due 
the company is currently in compliance with the restrictive debt covenants applicable to its financing arrangements  however  in the event the company is unable to comply with any of these covenants in the future  the holders of such indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and to proceed against their collateral  if applicable 
these actions would likely have a material adverse effect on the company
