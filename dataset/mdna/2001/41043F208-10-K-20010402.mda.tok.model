item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the significant growth in our net sales has resulted from an aggressive program of acquiring and developing o p patient care centers 
similarly  growth in our o p distribution and manufacturing net sales is attributable primarily to acquisitions 
at december   the company operated patient care centers  six distribution facilities and seven manufacturing facilities 
expansion the following table sets forth the number of patient care centers  certified practitioners and states including the district of columbia in which we operated at the end of each of the past three years for the years ended december  number of patient care centers number of certified practitioners number of states including dc recent acquisitions during  we acquired five o p companies for an aggregate consideration  excluding earn out provisions  of approximately million  consisting of approximately million of cash and million of promissory notes 
these o p companies  which operated seven patient care centers at december   had combined net sales of approximately million in the year ended december  additional amounts aggregating approximately million may be paid in connection with earnout provisions contained in acquisition agreements 
on july   we acquired novacare o p for an aggregate consideration of million 
novacare o p  which operated o p patient care centers at june   had net sales of approximately million in the twelve months ended june  we acquired five other o p companies during for an aggregate consideration  excluding potential earn out provisions  of approximately million 
these o p companies  which operated five patient care centers at december   had combined net sales of approximately million in the year ended december  sources of net sales the majority of our net sales continue to be derived from operating patient care centers 
the following table sets forth the percent contributed to net sales in each of the periods indicated by the principal sources of our net sales 
the decrease in the percentage of net sales contributed by distribution activities and decrease in the percentage of net sales attributable to manufacturing in and is primarily a result of the novacare o p acquisition which consisted entirely of patient care services 
for the years ended december  source of net sales patient care services manufacturing distribution payor mix we receive payments for o p services rendered to patients from private insurers  hmos  ppos  the patients directly and governmental payors  including medicare  medicaid and the va 
the sources and amounts of our net sales derived from patient care centers are determined by a number of factors  including the number and nature of o p services rendered and the rates of reimbursement among payor categories 
generally  private insurance and other third party reimbursement levels are greater than managed care hmo ppo  medicare  medicaid and va reimbursement levels 
changes in our payor mix can affect our profitability 
the following table sets forth the percent contributed to net sales in each of the following periods by the principal categories of payors for the years ended december  payor mix private pay and other medicare medicaid va state agencies payor mix data is based on a sampling of approximately of the patient care centers in  approximately of the patient care centers in and approximately of the patient care centers in adjusted ebitda and operating margin trends adjusted ebitda and operating margins in were lower than  primarily as a result of i higher material cost of goods sold  ii increased provision for bad debt expense and iii higher general and administrative costs 
in  margins were higher than  primarily as a result of i the acquisition of novacare o p which was entirely patient care services  which historically have experienced higher margins than distribution and manufacturing operations  and ii the elimination of duplicative overhead and corporate field personnel 
the following table sets forth our adjusted ebitda and operating margins during each of the past three years for the years ended december  adjusted ebitda margin operating margin adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense net  taxes  depreciation and amortization  discontinued operations  restructuring and integration costs  other expense net  extraordinary items and accounting change 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
while adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity  management understands that adjusted ebitda is customarily used as a criteria in evaluating health care companies and is a common metric used by lenders in debt covenants 
operating is defined as net income loss before interest expense  taxes and discontinued operations 
seasonality our results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have contributed to lower net sales during that quarter

this decrease principally resulted from an increase in the investment of working capital during  offset by an increase in cash earnings of approximately million during the comparability of cash flows used for investing and financing activities for each of the years in the three year period ended december  is largely impacted by the company s acquisition of the novacare o p from novacare  inc on july  the acquisition 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the aggregate purchase price consideration totaled million  which consisted of the assumption of liabilities and other obligations of million and the balance in cash 
of the cash portion  million was placed in escrow pending the determination of any potential post closing adjustments relating to working capital 
during  the company received million from novacare  inc pursuant to the post closing purchase price adjustment 
reference is made to the discussion under arbitration of dispute regarding adjusted working capital of novacare o p and subsequent litigation below for information regarding post closing adjustments 
hanger required approximately million in cash to close the acquisition  to pay approximately million of related fees and expenses  including debt issue costs of approximately million  and to refinance existing debt of approximately million 
the funds were raised by hanger through i borrowing approximately million of revolving credit and term loans under a new bank facility  ii selling million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  and iii selling million of redeemable preferred stock 
the new bank credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  of which million was drawn on in connection with the acquisition of novacare o p  a million tranche a term facility and a million tranche b term facility 
the company s consolidated liquidity position comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused credit facilities approximated million at december  compared to approximately million at december  consolidated working capital at december  of approximately million is up million from the december  level of million 
the company s total long term debt at december   including a current portion of approximately million  was approximately million 
such indebtedness included i million of million senior subordinated notes due  ii million for the revolving credit facility  iii million for tranche a term facility  iv million for tranche b term facility  and v a total of million of other indebtedness 
the revolving credit facility  and the tranche a and b term facilities the credit facility were entered into with the chase manhattan bank  bankers trust company  paribas and certain other banks the banks in connection with the acquisition 
the revolving credit facility matures on july   the tranche a term facility is payable in quarterly installments of million through july   and the tranche b term facility is payable in quarterly installments of  through december  and in quarterly installments of million through january  the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary in an agreement of this nature 
at december   the company was not in compliance with financial covenants under the credit facility for capital expenditure and adjusted interest coverage ratio 
in consideration for the banks waiver of the company s non compliance with these covenants  an amendment to the credit agreement effective march  was entered into which provided for an increase in the interest rates of the credit facility borrowings by basis points 
certain of the financial covenants were eased with respect to and under the terms of the amendment to the credit agreement 
in addition at december   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement for interest coverage and leverage coverage

certain of the financial covenants were eased with respect to and under the terms of the amendment to the credit agreement 
matters critical to the company s compliance with the credit facility s covenants  and ultimately its immediate term liquidity to the extent alternative sources of liquidity are not readily available  include improving operating results  through revenue growth and cost control  and reducing the company s investment in working capital 
as further discussed below  the company has retained the services of jay alix associates to assist in identifying programs aimed at achieving these objectives 
the company s ability to continue to comply with the credit facility covenants is dependent on certain factors  including a the ability of the company to effectuate the restructuring initiatives referred to above  and b the company s ability to continue to attract and retain experienced management and o p practitioners 
unexpected increases in the libor rate could also adversely impact the company s ability to comply with the credit facility s covenants 
management believes that the company will continue to comply with the terms of the credit facility and that the company s consolidated liquidity position is adequate to meet its short term and long term obligations 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets  restricts the payment of dividends and restricts the company from pursuing acquisition opportunities for the calendar year all or any portion of outstanding loans under the credit facility may be repaid at any time and commitments may be terminated in whole or in part at our option without premium or penalty  except that libor based loans may only be repaid at the end of the applicable interest period 
mandatory prepayments will be required in the event of certain sales of assets  debt or equity financings and under certain other circumstances 
the million outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock are convertible into shares of our non voting common stock at a price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the company is entitled to require that the redeemable preferred stock be converted into non voting common stock on and after july   if the average closing price of the common stock for consecutive trading days is equal to or greater than of the conversion price 
the redeemable preferred stock will be mandatorily redeemable on july  at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
in the event of a change in control  the company must offer to redeem all of the outstanding redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price equal to of the sum of the per share liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of payment 
the redeemable preferred stock accrues annual dividends  compounded quarterly  equal to  is subject to put rights and will not require principal payments prior to maturity on july  agreement with jay alix associates on december   the company retained the services of ja a to assist in identifying areas for cash generation and profit improvement 
subsequent to the completion of this diagnostic phase  the company modified and extended the retention agreement on january  to include the implementation of certain restructuring activities 
among the targeted plans are spending reductions  improving the utilization and effectiveness of support services  including claims processing  the refinement of materials purchasing and inventory management and the consolidation of distribution services 
in addition  the company will seek to enhance revenues through revised marketing efforts and more efficient billing procedures 
the terms of this engagement provide for payment of ja a s normal hourly fees plus a success fee if certain defined benefits are achieved 
management has elected to pay one half of any earned success fees in cash  with the remaining one half of the success fee paid through a grant of options to purchase the company s stock 
all the options will be granted with an exercise price of per share  which was the average closing price of the company s common stock for all trading days during the period from december  january  the number of options will be determined by multiplying the non cash half of each success fee invoice of ja a by and dividing the product by 
the options are to be granted within days of each invoice  shall be exercisable beginning with the sixth month following each award and shall expire five years from the termination of ja a s engagement 
the number of options that will be granted cannot be determined at this time 
integration and restructuring costs in december of  management and the board of directors determined that major performance improvement initiatives needed to be adopted 
two hundred and thirty four employees were severed  resulting in a charge of approximately million the amount is offset by approximately  restructuring benefit described below  and in december the company retained ja a to do an assessment of the opportunities available for improved financial and operating performance 
ja a was retained to develop a comprehensive performance improvement program 
the plan developed by ja a and the company calls for a million reduction in operating expenses over a two year period  significant increases in patient revenue and reductions in inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the plan calls for the incurrence of one time  non recurring costs of nearly million during the performance improvement plan was provided to the secured lenders on february  and calls for formal quarterly status reports to the hanger board and lenders 
as of december   the company recorded approximately  in restructuring liabilities 
those amounts were paid in january of  thus completing the plan of restructuring 
the above restructuring charges and the related cost savings represent our best estimate  but necessarily make numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance  general business and economic conditions  raw materials and product pricing levels  government legislation  the timing of implementation of the restructuring and related employee reductions and patient care center closings and other matters  many of which are outside of our control 
our estimate of cost savings is not necessarily indicative of future performance  which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth and is subject to the considerations relating to forward looking statements that are set forth below under the caption forward looking statements

arbitration of dispute regarding adjusted working capital of novacare o p and subsequent litigation as stated above  on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of novacare o p from novacare  inc pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated april  and amended on may  and june   by and among novacare  nc resources  inc  hanger and hpo acquisition corporation 
the purchase price paid by us was million  subject to adjustment to the extent that novacare o p s adjusted working capital at june  was less or greater than million 
of the purchase price paid by us  million was placed in escrow with us bank trust national association  as exchange agent  pending the determination of such amount of adjusted working capital 
we and novacare disagreed regarding the determination of the amount of novacare o p adjusted working capital and on february   we and novacare submitted the matter to the independent arbitrator in accordance with the dispute resolution arbitration mechanism provided under the stock purchase agreement 
the agreement provided that such arbitrator s determination would be conclusive and binding upon the parties 
on may   the independent arbitrator issued its report concluding that novacare o p s adjusted working capital at june  was approximately million and that we were entitled to the working capital deficiency of approximately million  representing the required decrease in the purchase price previously paid by us for novacare o p 
on may   the escrow agent released the million of escrowed funds to us 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we were entitled to receive the approximately million balance of the working capital deficiency on or before june   which was days after the date of the independent arbitrator determination 
on june   novacare the name of which was changed to nahc  inc filed a complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county against us  our subsidiary  hpo acquisition corp  and the escrow agent alleging the wrongful release of the escrowed funds and seeking the return of such escrowed funds to the escrow agent 
on june   we filed an answer and counterclaim requesting the court to dismiss the complaint and confirm the entire independent arbitrator award 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement with novacare providing for dismissal of the litigation and execution of a mutual release relating to currently unknown matters arising from the acquisition 
in addition  the settlement agreement provided that of the million owed by novacare to us  million would be paid immediately by novacare and novacare would execute a collateralized promissory note in the principal amount of million  plus annual interest  payable monthly over the following six months 
actual payment of the million was received by us on july  in connection with the settlement  we were confident that we would have prevailed in the litigation 
however  in view of the time that would have been involved in obtaining a favorable result and novacare s inability to pay the full million at the time the settlement agreement was entered into  we determined it would be prudent to enter into such agreement  under which we gave novacare a million discount in exchange for the immediate payment of million and the greater certainty of receiving million under the promissory note 
the million was received in a timely manner with some minor deductions relating to certain other outstanding accounts payable between the parties
