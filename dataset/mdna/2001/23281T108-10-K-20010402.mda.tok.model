item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview cysive is a leading software engineering firm that builds web  wireless and voice activated software solutions for companies that conduct a significant portion of their business through electronic commerce channels that are integrated with their existing internal systems  such as accounting  billing  manufacturing and inventory control 
since commencing operations in  we have used advanced internet technologies to build our customers software systems 
we design software solutions that can handle high volumes of customer transactions  operate reliably on a hours a day  seven days a week basis  and expand to meet the growth requirements of large scale businesses 
due to the advanced technologies necessary to complete our projects  we employ software engineers with an average of more than years of experience who use a well defined process to deliver reliable and secure custom systems on a timely basis 
prior to  we built large scale  distributed systems using approaches and technologies that are the foundations for current internet applications 
at that time  our advanced technology focus required a sales effort led by technology savvy project managers 
in late and early  our technology group evaluated and developed software prototypes using key internet technologies such as java  xml and corba 
after successfully deploying our first e business system in mid  we began to target customers who were making significant investments in their e business applications 
as a result  there was a fundamental shift in our business strategy away from general purpose distributed systems to customized e business applications 
as part of this strategy  in the fourth quarter of and the first half of  we spent considerable resources to accomplish two specific goals 
our first goal was to train all of our software engineers with advanced internet technologies that had been researched and prototyped by our technology group 
our second goal was to deploy a direct sales force capable of selling e business applications 
these initiatives significantly impacted our results of operations for these three quarters 
specifically  the generation of a sales pipeline of e business applications and the deployment of our sales force affected our revenues and sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  the completion of two of our largest distributed systems combined with the extensive training of our software engineers caused our utilization rates and gross margins to decline during these quarters 
these investments positioned us to become a leading e business engineering firm during the period from the third quarter of to the second quarter of in the second half of  we again identified a technology shift emerging as customers required an integrated solution for their web  wireless and voice activated systems 
as a result  we began focusing our non utilized software engineering personnel on solving these complex development and integration issues 
we formed the product solutions group to package the intellectual property rights retained from prior experience in selected vertical markets with the new solutions being developed by both our product solutions group and non utilized engineers 
during the second half of  the general economic slow down in conjunction with the rapidly changing technology environment caused our results from operations to significantly decline 
we addressed this decline in our operating results by implementing a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  which reduced non billable employees and aligned the support infrastructure with the current billable staffing levels 
focusing our engineering talent on developing the current technology solutions required by businesses  in conjunction with the implementation of our restructuring plan  has enabled us to maximize cysive s capital resources to better position us for future opportunities 
we derive our revenues from software engineering services that are provided primarily on a time and materials basis 
revenues are recognized and billed monthly by multiplying the number of hours expended by our software engineers in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
our customers reimburse us for direct expenses allocated to a project such as airfare  lodging and meals 
consequently  these direct reimbursements are excluded from revenues 
our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on factors such as the number of projects  the amount and timing of our customers expenditures  employee utilization rates  hourly billing rates and general economic conditions 
revenues from a few large customers may constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in a particular quarter or year 
for example  in  our five largest customers represented of our revenues  and in our five largest customers represented of our revenues 
the following table identifies these customers and the percentage of our revenues derived from each 
year ended december  year ended december  customer of revenues customer of revenues sylvan prometric cisco systems  prometric equifax secure  inc corpay  inc classified ventures  inc hub group  inc cisco systems  inc amerix inc careerpath 
com  inc uunet technologies  inc revenues from any given customer will vary from period to period 
we expect  however  that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that any significant customer uses less of our services or terminates its relationship with us  our revenues may decline substantially 
we attempt to mitigate our revenue concentration issues by contractual wind down provisions and by rapid redeployment of our software engineers 
the number of employees increased from as of january  to as of december  our recruiting of software engineers and support staff is directly correlated to our projected business growth 
direct costs consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our software engineers and the non billable portion of other direct project costs 
allocated costs related to specific employees performing quality assurance reviews for customers are also included in direct costs 
we expect that our per capita direct costs will increase over time due to wage increases and inflation 
in addition  these costs may increase in the future because prospective employees may perceive that the stock option component of our compensation package is not as valuable if our stock price rises 
our gross margins are affected by trends in the utilization rate of our software engineers  defined as the percentage of our software engineers time billed to customers  divided by the total available hours in a period 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled  we may need to redeploy our project personnel 
any resulting non billable time may adversely affect our gross margins 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our management  finance and administration  human resources  information technology  recruiting and the non billable portion of our quality assurance and regional management personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include depreciation and amortization  general operating expenses such as telephones  office supplies  travel  outside professional services  and training and facilities costs  and research and development of new technologies for product solutions  including maintaining our knowledge base and writing technical reviews 
as we increase our efforts in developing complete product solutions through research and development of new technologies and the packaging of existing experience and intellectual property rights for our current and potential customers  we anticipate a shift of certain direct costs into general and administrative costs as the resources move from direct to indirect product solutions 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  benefits  marketing programs and travel costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts 
we sell our services through a direct sales force organized by geographic region 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to build a direct sales force and expand our marketing programs 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of real estate costs and severance costs of salaries and benefits for a certain period of time for those employees identified in our restructuring plan approved by the board of directors in december the real estate costs include the projected rent expense we are obligated to pay under the terms of the leases for those offices identified to be closed 
we are uncertain as to when  if ever  we will be able to sublease these facilities and we have therefore expensed the total future rent expense for these locations 
real estate costs also include certain leasehold improvements and other related costs 
deferred stock compensation relates to grants of options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price below the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant  resulting in cumulative non cash compensation charges of million 
stock compensation expense related to the vested portion of these option grants was million and million in and  respectively 
we reversed million from deferred stock compensation related to grants canceled in the remaining balance of million will be amortized as follows projected stock year ended compensation expense in millions recent events in march  two of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection 
we re evaluated our allowance for bad debts related to those specific accounts as of december  and increased the allowance by an additional  in order to fully reserve these accounts 
this adjustment resulted in an additional loss of per share for the year ended december  from previously reported information 
on march   we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our personnel by to positions  or approximately of our total workforce 
severance and other costs associated with the restructuring are estimated to be million to million and will be recorded as a restructuring charge in the first quarter of results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the relative composition of revenues and selected statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues direct costs gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing restructuring expense stock compensation total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of software engineers  an increase in customers and an increase in our billable rates 
as a result of our direct sales model  our number of active customers increased to in from in our headcount of billable software engineers increased to at december  from at december  direct costs 
direct costs increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct costs increased to in from in this increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in our average utilization rate in to from in our lower utilization rate in resulted primarily from a decrease in the demand for our services as a result of a general economic slow down  reducing the urgency for internet based solutions in the latter half of the year 
direct costs also increased due to an increase in our wage rates 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in the gross margin decreased to in from in because our direct costs exceeded the rate of increase in revenue growth 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to the addition and expansion of office space  an increase in legal fees related to our litigation support  an increase in bad debt expense  the inclusion of certain costs incurred as a publicly traded company  an increase in our recruiting and corporate administrative staffs and the addition of general infrastructure to support our increased headcount 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the expansion of our marketing and sales departments as well as an increase in variable compensation linked to the increase in sales and billing rates in additionally  we expanded our marketing programs directed at building brand recognition 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in from in restructuring expense 
we recorded million in restructuring expense in restructuring expense represents the amounts we believe the company will pay out in the future in severance expense and in real estate costs due to the lay off of certain non technical employees and the closing of some of our satellite offices 
as a percentage of revenues  restructuring expense represented in stock compensation 
stock compensation expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the expense in was primarily related to a revaluation of our deemed fair market value in conjunction with our initial public offering in which certain options were fully vested and we recorded the stock compensation expense in full 
in addition  the expense included the amortization of the deferred stock compensation related to the options granted in at prices deemed below fair market value  which vest over a period of time 
the expense in was related to the same amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the grants 
in addition  we granted certain non qualified stock options at a discounted price from the fair market value in resulting in additional deferred stock compensation that will be amortized over a four year period 
the expense in also includes compensation expense related to the granting of restricted common stock to employees in connection with the fourth quarter bonus 
operating loss 
operating loss increased million  or to a loss of million in from a loss of million in the operating loss margin decreased  however  to in from in other income  net 
net other income increased million to million in from  in primarily due to interest income generated from the initial public and secondary offering proceeds 
loss before taxes 
loss before taxes decreased  to a loss of million in from a loss of million in this change was primarily due to the increase in the interest income and decrease in stock compensation expense offset by general and administrative costs and restructuring expense in income tax benefit expense 
we recorded a million net tax expense in as compared to a million net tax benefit in the benefit resulted primarily from the stock compensation expenses recorded in in  we elected to reserve a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset  creating a net income tax expense for the year because of the uncertainty of when the deferred tax benefit will be realized in future periods 
net loss 
net loss increased million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in this change is due primarily to the recording of a tax benefit in versus a tax expense and restructuring expense recorded in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase in revenues primarily reflected the direct sales model established in mid  the benefits of which were not fully realized until early in addition to a much larger customer base in  the average project size increased substantially for several of our major customers 
our headcount of billable software engineers increased from at december  to at december  direct costs 
direct costs increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  direct costs decreased to in from in this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in our average utilization rate in to from in our lower utilization rate in resulted primarily from the completion of two of our largest distributed systems and the extensive training of all of our software engineers during the first half of the benefit of our higher utilization in  however  was partially offset by an increase in our wage rates 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in because our revenue growth exceeded the rate that direct costs increased  the gross margin increased to in from in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to the addition and expansion of office space  an increase in our recruiting and corporate administrative staffs and the addition of infrastructure to support our increased headcount 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decrease was due primarily to our ability to allocate our costs over a greater revenue base  particularly with respect to depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to the significant expansion of our direct sales force in during  we increased the number of our direct sales professionals to from five in additionally  we launched our marketing programs directed at building brand recognition 
stock compensation 
we recorded million in stock compensation in this expense represents the difference between the deemed fair market value of the underlying vested stock options and their exercise price 
this amount was significantly larger than the stock compensation amount in previous years and was primarily related to a revaluation of our deemed fair market value in conjunction with our public offering 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased million to a loss of million in from income of  in due primarily to the stock compensation charge we recorded in other income  net 
net other income increased  to  in from  in primarily due to interest income from the initial public offering proceeds 
income loss before taxes 
income before taxes decreased million to a loss of million in from income of  in this change was primarily due to the stock compensation expense in as a result  the loss before taxes margin was in compared to an income before taxes margin of in income tax benefit 
we recorded a million net tax benefit in this benefit resulted primarily from the stock compensation expenses recorded in we will realize this benefit upon exercise of any non qualified stock options in future periods 
net income loss 
net income decreased million to a loss of million in from net income of  in due to the stock compensation expense recorded in in addition  we had no tax expense in due to our election to be treated as an s corporation for tax purposes 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods indicated 
we derived this data from our unaudited financial statements  and in our opinion  they include all adjustments  which consist only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the financial results for the periods 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  changes in average billing rates  utilization rates and personnel additions or reductions  as well as the timing of expenses 
accordingly  our results for any given quarter or series of quarters are not necessarily indicative of our results for any future period 
however  our quarterly operating results may represent trends that aid in understanding our business

revenues increased from the quarter ended march  through the quarter ended june  because our utilization rates increased from to and our average billing rate increased per hour over the six quarters 
revenues declined from the quarter ended june  through the quarter ended december  revenues decreased primarily as a result of the decreases in utilization in the quarter ended september  and december  to and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin was in the range during the periods shown from march  through june   reflecting the increases in utilization and fees in this period that increased in line with the increase in direct costs in the same periods 
our gross margin decreased to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of these decreases are due primarily to two reasons 
first  in august  after a customer failed to make payment under the contractual terms of a sales agreement  we canceled this customer s sale agreement 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we did not record any revenue in the third quarter related to this sales agreement as there was uncertainty as to when and if we would ever be paid for our services 
however  we still incurred the same amount of direct costs during the period because we had expected the contract to continue through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter 
second  the general slowing of the economy resulted in a decrease in internet related projects  which decreased our revenue in the fourth quarter 
we did not lay off engineers during this quarter 
instead  we trained these engineers in new technologies that we believe will support the next wave of technology spending 
operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was generally in the range during the periods shown from march  through june   reflecting greater operating leverage as these expenditures were spread over a larger revenue base 
in the third and fourth quarters of  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue increased to and  respectively 
these costs were related to our increase in bad debt expense related to the write off of a bad account and other questionable receivables and an increase in recruiting costs and facility costs during these two quarters 
in the fourth quarter  we adopted a restructuring plan that eliminated certain overhead positions as well as closing certain satellite offices in an effort to reduce these costs in future periods 
sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue were generally in the range during the periods shown above 
in the third and fourth quarters of  sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues increased due primarily to marketing expenses related to our brand building campaign when we changed the name of the company to cysive 
the fourth quarter of showed an increase in the sales and marketing costs even though there was a decrease in the overall expense due to the decrease in revenue growth for that period 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a one time restructuring charge in accordance with the restructuring plan 
we recorded expenses related to the severance of employees  the closing of satellite offices and the impairment of certain assets related to the offices 
stock compensation expense for all quarters presented represents the vesting of options granted at a value below fair market value 
the second quarter of is higher due to the fact that options to purchase  of fully vested shares were granted during that quarter at a value below fair market value 
the remaining periods represent the straight line amortization of the deferred portion of the stock compensation expense 
in addition  the fourth quarter also includes compensation expense related to the granting of restricted stock for fourth quarter bonuses 
liquidity and capital resources on october   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
after deducting expenses  we received approximately million in proceeds from this transaction 
on october   we received an additional million in proceeds when the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares of our common stock 
on march   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock 
after deducting expenses  we received approximately million in proceeds from this transaction 
in september  we renewed our line of credit with merrill lynch business financial services inc under which we are entitled to draw up to million in borrowings 
we intend to use any borrowings under the line of credit for working capital purposes 
the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is calculated using the day dealer commercial paper rate as quoted in the wall street journal  plus per annum 
the credit facility expires in september any borrowings under the line of credit will be secured by all of our assets 
the line of credit requires our financial ratios to be in compliance with the debt covenants 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  investments  which reflect the application of our net proceeds from our public offerings  were million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  capital expenditures of million for the year ended december  were used primarily for computer equipment  office equipment and leasehold improvements related to our growth 
through september   we operated as an s corporation 
accordingly  our stockholders included their pro rata share of our income in their personal income tax returns  and we were not subject to federal and most state income taxes during the periods prior to that time 
our stockholders elected to rescind the s corporation election effective on october  we paid million to our stockholders on december  as an s corporation distribution  and this distribution was funded through operating income 
we anticipate that the net proceeds from our public offerings  existing sources of liquidity and funds generated from operations  should be adequate to fund our currently anticipated cash needs through at least the next months 
to the extent we are unable to fund our operations from cash flows  we may need to obtain financing from external sources in the form of either additional equity or indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or that  if available  the financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
in december  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock at the discretion of our executive officers 
as of december   we had not repurchased any shares of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to interest rate risk related to our borrowings under our credit facility with merrill lynch co  inc we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of december
