item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company operates in three reportable business segments fleet management solutions fms  which provides full service leasing  commercial rental and programmed maintenance of trucks  tractors and trailers to customers  principally in the us  canada and the united kingdom  supply chain solutions scs  which provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions that support customers entire supply chains  from inbound raw materials through distribution of finished goods throughout north america  in latin america  europe and asia  and dedicated contract carriage dcc  which provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution  principally in north america 
during  the company sold its public transportation services business rpts 
the following discussion excludes the results of rpts  which has been classified as discontinued operations 
consolidated results years ended december in thousands earnings from continuing operations before unusual items    per diluted common share earnings from continuing operations    per diluted common share weighted average shares outstanding diluted    year expense and restructuring and other charges 
earnings from continuing operations increased percent in and decreased percent in see operating results by business segments for a further discussion of operating results in the past three years 
earnings per share growth rates have exceeded earnings growth rates over the last two years because the average number of shares outstanding has decreased during these periods 
the decrease in average shares outstanding reflects the impact of the company s various stock repurchase programs conducted through the end of years ended december in thousands revenue fleet management solutions    supply chain solutions    dedicated contact carriage    eliminations    total revenue    revenue from continuing operations increased percent in compared with  led by scs  which grew percent 
fms posted revenue gains of percent  due primarily to increased fuel revenue resulting from increases in related fuel prices 
however  the company did not realize additional contribution margin as a result of these increases 
revenue from continuing operations increased percent in compared with  led by scs  which grew percent 
fms posted revenue gains of percent due primarily to full service leasing and programmed maintenance 
the fms segment leases revenue earning equipment  sells fuel and provides maintenance and other ancillary services to the scs and dcc segments 
inter segment sales are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties 
eliminations reflect the elimination of revenue for these services and sales 
years ended december in thousands operating expense    percentage of revenue operating expense increased percent in compared with the increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel costs due to fuel price increases 
operating expense increased percent in compared with  due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense  outside driver costs  vehicle liability and technology costs primarily as a result of higher business volumes and higher fuel costs due to fuel price increases  particularly in the second half of years ended december in thousands freight under management expense    percentage of revenue freight under management fum expense represents subcontracted freight costs on logistics contracts for which the company purchases transportation 
fum expense decreased million  or percent  in the company s vehicle based scs revenue in was flat compared with  which led to a similar trend related to fum expense 
fum expense increased million  or percent  in compared with  reflecting growth in related logistics contracts 
the company focused its efforts to expand its scs business in on service based  rather than vehicle based revenue and expects to continue this strategy in years ended december in thousands depreciation expense    gains on vehicle sales    equipment rental    depreciation expense decreased by million  or percent  compared with the decrease resulted principally from sale leaseback and other leasing transactions which increased the number of leased as opposed to owned vehicles in the company s fleet 
consistent with the charges recorded in the third quarter of described in restructuring and other charges to reflect decreases in the market value of used tractors  the company reduced residual values for certain vehicles  principally tractors  currently in use and expected to be disposed of during the next two years 
in light of this change  the company expects to record additional depreciation and rent expense over the next two years on a declining basis 
depreciation expense decreased percent in compared with  due to the impact of sale leaseback transactions completed since december and  to a lesser extent  depreciation changes made over the past several years with respect to residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment 
gains on vehicle sales decreased to million in from million in during  average sales proceeds per unit decreased for certain classes of tractors and have generally been stable for other tractors and types of trucks compared with however  the average book value per unit of units sold in was generally greater than that of units sold in gains on vehicle sales decreased percent in compared with due to a decrease in the average gain per vehicle sold  which offset a percent increase in the number of vehicles sold 
the reduced average gains reflect the overall increased carrying value of vehicles at the date of disposition and a changing mix of vehicles sold and disposal methods 
average proceeds per vehicle sold in exceeded levels 
the company periodically reviews and adjusts the residual values  reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
the company believes that its carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate 
however  a greater than anticipated decline in the market for used vehicles may require the company to further adjust such values and estimates 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment 
equipment rental costs have increased in and compared with prior years as a result of sale leaseback and securitization transactions completed in the last two years 
years ended december in thousands interest expense    percentage of revenue interest expense decreased percent in  compared with  due primarily to lower commercial paper interest rates  debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the rpts sale and the impact of sale leaseback transactions completed since december interest expense was virtually unchanged in compared with in  the effect of debt reductions associated with the use of proceeds from the rpts sale and the impact of sale leaseback transactions completed since december was offset by the impact of higher average outstanding debt levels  particularly during the second and third quarters of  primarily from increased levels of capital sending 
years ended december in thousands miscellaneous expense income  net    the company recorded net miscellaneous expense in compared with net miscellaneous income in the growth in expense was due to an increase of million in fees due to an increase in dollar volume related to the company s trade receivables sale facility in additionally  in  such fees were offset by a million gain on the sale of non operating property and million of interest income earned on temporarily investing the proceeds from the rpts sale 
miscellaneous income increased in compared to years ended december in thousands unusual items restructuring and other charges  net    year expense   unusual items represent restructuring and other charges  which include asset impairment charges  and year expense

the company s effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the lower effective tax rates in and resulted primarily from lower state income taxes and lower net non deductible items 
restructuring and other charges in  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million 
the components of the charge were as follows in thousands impairment tractors identified for accelerated disposal  impairment other tractors owned  leased  asset impairment charges  other charges recovery of prior year charges  total  the most significant portion of the charge was a result of the industry wide downturn in the market for new and used class vehicles the largest heavy duty tractors and straight trucks which led to a decrease in the market value of used tractors during the second half of the company s unsold class inventory consists of units previously used by customers of the fms segment 
tractors identified for accelerated disposal represent revenue earning equipment held for sale that the company identified in the third quarter of as increasingly undesirable and unmarketable due to lower powered engines or a potential lack of future support for parts and service 
impairment of other tractors reflects owned and leased units for which estimated fair value less costs to sell declined below carrying value or termination value  which represents the final payment due to lessors  in the case of leased units in the third and fourth quarters of the company was involved in litigation with a former customer  officemax  relating to a logistics services agreement that was terminated in in october  the company agreed to an out of court settlement with officemax  ending this litigation 
asset impairment charges relate to the write off  net of recoveries in the fourth quarter  of certain assets related to the officemax contract 
other charges of  represent consulting fees incurred during related to the completion of the company s profitability improvement study 
recovery of prior year charges represents both the reversal of severance and employee related charges and gains on vehicles sold in the united kingdom during the third quarter of  for which an impairment charge had been recorded in the restructuring

operating results by business segment years ended december in thousands revenue fleet management solutions full service lease and programmed maintenance    commercial rental    fuel    other    supply chain solutions    dedicated contract carriage    eliminations    total revenue    years ended december in thousands contribution margin fleet management solutions    supply chain solutions    dedicated contract carriage    eliminations    central support services    restructuring and other charges    year expense   earnings from continuing operations before income taxes    during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented several restructuring initiatives designed to improve profitability and align the organizational structure with the strategic direction of the company see restructuring and other charges 
as part of the restructuring  the company changed how it manages and measures the business during the first quarter of prior to the restructuring  the company s three reportable business segments were transportation services  integrated logistics and international 
the principal changes from prior management and measurement are management of the business along product lines  without regard to geography  discrete management and presentation of the dcc business  and segment profitability measured by contribution margin 
the business segment information presented reflects such changes 
prior year information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation 
management evaluates business segment financial performance based upon several factors  of which the primary measure is contribution margin 
contribution margin represents each business segment s revenue  less direct costs and direct overheads related to the segment s operations 
business segment contribution margin for all segments net of eliminations  less central support services css expenses and unusual items  is equal to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
css are those costs incurred to support all business segments  including sales and marketing  human resources  finance  shared management information systems mis  customer solutions  health and safety  legal and communications 
css also includes expenses of certain new business initiatives  ryder capital services and e commerce  which may be reported as business segments in the future once such operations become material 
contribution margin related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers equipment contribution is included in both fms and the business segment which served the customer  then eliminated 
equipment contribution included in scs contribution margin was million in and million in and equipment contribution included in dcc contribution margin was million in and million in and interest expense is primarily allocated to the fms business segment 
these results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent stand alone entity during the periods presented 
fleet management solutions fms revenue increased percent in compared with and percent in compared with the results for both years were impacted by increases in fuel revenue  which were due to increases in fuel prices 
fms realized minimal changes in margin as a result of fuel price increases 
full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue increased in and compared with the previous years as a result of growth in both fleet size and average revenue per unit 
commercial rental revenue decreased in and increased in compared with the previous years 
in  rental revenue grew due to a backlog in the arrival of new vehicles for full service lease customers 
rental vehicles were provided to these customers until new full service lease vehicles arrived and were prepared for use 
in  such backlog was reduced to levels more comparable with  which reduced the demand for rental vehicles by full service lease customers 
pure rental revenue total rental revenue less rental revenue related to units provided to full service lease customers  increased percent in compared with the prior year 
rental fleet utilization was percent in and and percent in pure rental revenue and rental fleet utilization statistics are monitored for the us only  however  management believes such metrics to be indicative of rental product performance for the company as a whole 
other revenue  which relates to non contractual maintenance  tractor rentals and other ancilliary revenue  increased and percent in and  respectively  compared with prior years 
contribution margin as a percentage of dry revenue revenue excluding fuel was flat in compared with and decreased to percent in from percent in in  improvements in full service lease margins  decreased running costs and the impact of pension income on benefits costs were offset by reduced gains in vehicle sales when compared with decreased running costs in were generally attributable to a decrease in the average age of the fleet 
pension income attributable to fms from the company s principal pension plan in the us increased by million in compared with the decrease in contribution margin in compared with was primarily due to reduced operating efficiencies in commercial rental  higher compensation  environmental and vehicle liability expenses  the impact of lost business and delays of in service and out service processing of vehicles 
the company expects the rate of revenue growth for fms to slow in as the company focuses on contribution margin 
the company anticipates that pension income will decrease to levels in  due principally to market performance of pension investments 
the company also anticipates that gains on sales of used vehicles will be less than those recorded in the company plans to compensate for the impact of the foregoing on contribution margin by attempting to reduce costs  improve pricing discipline and better utilize assets 
there is no assurance that such strategy will be effective in offsetting anticipated reductions in contribution margin in fms in the company s fleet of owned and leased revenue earning equipment is summarized as follows years ended december number of units by type trucks   tractors   trailers   other   years ended december number of units by business full service lease   commercial rental   service vehicles and other   the totals in each of the tables above include the following non revenue earning equipment years ended december number of units not yet earning revenue   no longer earning revenue   supply chain solutions scs revenue increased percent in and percent in compared with the previous years 
revenue growth in each year was due to expansion of business with existing customers and addition of new customers  particularly automotive suppliers  aerospace  electronics and technology companies 
contribution margin as a percentage of operating revenue increased to percent in compared with percent in and decreased in compared with percent in the improved contribution margin percentage in compared with was the result of improved performance in the company s operations outside the us the decrease in contribution margin percentage in compared with was due to numerous factors including lower margins in volume sensitive accounts  increased operating expenses on several start up accounts and increased overhead and technology costs to support product development 
the company expects revenue growth in to come principally from electronics and technology companies as automotive related growth is expected to slow in response to cutbacks in production announced by customers 
dedicated contract carriage dcc revenue increased percent in and percent in compared with the previous years 
dcc revenue growth was due to increased fuel costs billed to customers and net business growth in both years 
dcc contribution margin as a percentage of operating revenue was flat in compared with contribution margin decreased to percent of operating revenue in compared with percent in due to reduced profitability on certain accounts in  some of which were terminated prior to the company expects trends in dcc noted in to continue in central support services css increased percent in and percent in compared with the prior years 
css increased in due to increased spending for mis and new initiatives such as electronic commerce 
additionally  in  css was reduced by a million gain on a real estate sale as well as million of interest income earned on temporarily investing the proceeds from the rpts sale 
css increased in compared with due to increased mis and employee compensation costs and lower gains on land sales compared to discontinued operations years ended december in thousands earnings from discontinued operations  less income taxes   gain on sale of discontinued operations  less income taxes  on september   the company completed the sale of rpts for million in cash and realized a million after tax gain per diluted common share 
the transaction generated gains from the settlement and curtailment of certain employee benefit and postretirement plans  offset by provisions for severance and direct transaction and other costs 
the rpts disposal has been accounted for as discontinued operations and accordingly  its operating results and cash flows are segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
financial resources and liquidity cash flows the following is a summary of the company s cash flows from continuing operating  financing and investing activities years ended december in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    financing activities    investing activities    net cash flows from continuing operations    cash provided by operating activities increased in compared with primarily due to increases in trade receivables sold in and lower capital working needs in cash used in financing activities decreased in compared with during  cash of million was used in financing activities  primarily to repurchase million of common stock and reduce debt by million 
the stock repurchase program was completed in and there was no such program in cash used in investing activities was million compared with cash provided by investing activities of million in in  cash provided by investing activities was the result of proceeds from the rpts sale 
after adjusting for such proceeds  cash used in investing activities decreased in compared with primarily as a result of reduced levels of capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash flow from continuing operating activities in compared with was attributable to higher working capital needs 
the higher working capital needs related primarily to a decrease in the aggregate balance of trade receivables sold and the cash requirements associated with the tax liabilities of the rpts sale 
during  receivables also increased in conjunction with revenue growth  and accounts payable for vehicle purchases decreased due to the timing of vehicle deliveries 
during  cash of million was used in financing activities  primarily to repurchase million of common stock and pay dividends of million 
since  the company has repurchased million shares of common stock 
the company utilized proceeds from the rpts sale  the automotive carrier and the consumer truck rental businesses to fund these programs 
the following is a summary of capital expenditures years ended december in thousands revenue earning equipment    operating property and equipment    the decrease in capital spending in was planned based upon the significant increase in capital spending and fleet replacement in fms that took place during the first half of the overall increase in capital spending for was consistent with management s expectations of anticipated growth and fleet replacement in full service leasing and commercial rental 
however  capital spending was significantly above plan during the first half of the excess spending reflected higher than anticipated requirements for replacement lease equipment and new lease sales 
during the second half of  management reviewed capital spending requirements and undertook several actions to slow the rate of spending 
the company expects to reduce capital expenditures in by approximately percent compared with due to improved controls over early replacement of units and increased pricing discipline over new business 
during the past three years  the company completed a number of acquisitions  each of which has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
total consideration for these acquisitions was million in  million in and million in the company will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in fms and scs in the company s cash requirements are funded principally through operations and the sale of revenue earning equipment 
financing ryder utilizes external capital to support growth in its asset based product lines 
the company has a variety of financing alternatives available to fund its capital needs 
these alternatives include long and medium term public and private debt  including asset backed securities and operating leases  as well as variable rate financing available through bank credit facilities  commercial paper and receivable conduits 
the company also periodically enters into sale and leaseback agreements on revenue earning equipment  which are accounted for as operating leases 
in  the company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the rpts sale and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment to reduce debt 
the company s debt ratings as of december  were as follows commercial unsecured paper notes moody s investors service p baa standard poor s ratings group a bbb fitch f a debt totaled billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of the decrease in debt in was principally due to repayment of million in medium term notes  net of an increase of million in commercial paper borrowing 
the company s reduced debt in is also due to an increase of million of trade receivables sold in compared with debt decreased to billion at the end of from billion at the end of debt decreased in due to repayments of debt using a portion of the proceeds received from the rpts sale  net of increased borrowings to support capital expenditures 
in  the company made unsecured note payments of million  which were partially offset by an increase in commercial paper borrowings of million and issuance of million in medium term notes 
the company s debt to equity ratio at december  decreased to percent from percent at december  the company has a million global revolving credit facility  which expires in june the primary purpose of the credit facility is to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
at the company s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
the credit facility has an annual facility fee of percent based on the company s current credit rating

such securitizations generated cash proceeds of million in the vehicles were sold for approximately their carrying value and the company retained an interest in the form of a subordinated note issued at the date of each sale 
the company has provided credit enhancement in the form of cash reserve funds and a pledge of the subordinated notes as additional security for the trusts to the extent that delinquencies and losses on the truck leases and related vehicle sales are incurred 
the vehicle securitizations provide the company with further liquidity and increased access to the capital markets 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
the company manages such exposures in several ways including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
the company does not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
the company s interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  the company also uses interest rate swap and cap agree ments to manage its fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of its debt instru ments to that of its portfolio of assets 
no interest rate swap or cap agreements were outstanding at december  or the following tables summarize debt obligations outstanding as of december  and expressed in us dollar equivalents 
the tables show the amount of debt  including current portion  and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  and this information should be read in conjunction with the debt note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report

the company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
no foreign currency option contracts or forward agreements were outstanding at december  or the company does not generally hedge the translation exposure related to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies and of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries  the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not material 
the exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a portion of the company s service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
as of december   the company had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
none of the company s current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased and as such the company is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices 
the company believes the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the operations of the company involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require the company to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  the company has upgraded operating facilities and implemented various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million in and million in the company incurred million of environmental expenses in  compared with million in and million in  which included normal recurring expenses  such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
the decrease in expenses in was due to increased claim recoveries and a decrease in the number of projects compared with the increase in expenses for reflected the impact of lower claim recoveries compared with in  the company also increased the previous accrual for a site as a result of the ongoing evaluation of the contamination and alternative cleanup methods 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of the company s environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
see the environmental matters note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
euro conversion on january   the participating countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
introduction of the euro is scheduled to phase in over a period ending january   with the participating countries existing national currencies continuing as legal tender through february   at which time the existing national currencies will be completely removed from circulation 
due to the nature of current international operations  conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
other matters in january  the company revised its vacation policy in the us starting january   employees will earn vacation based on the calendar year rather than their anniversary date
