item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview since our inception in  we have been a leader in applying emerging technologies by building and operating integrated information systems that allow our clients to transform themselves into a digital business model 
our success in assisting clients has been accompanied by significant growth in revenue  personnel  and infrastructure over our twelve year history 
we derive our revenues primarily from the delivery of professional services 
we offer our services to clients under time and materials contracts or under fixed fee contracts 
for time and material projects  we recognize revenues based on the number of hours worked by consultants at a rate per hour agreed upon with our clients 
we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion method based on project hours worked 
the percentage of our revenues from fixed fee contracts was approximately in and in we provide our application outsourcing services at a minimum monthly fee and charge extra fees for services that exceed agreed upon parameters 
revenues from these services are recognized as services are provided 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits and depreciation of hosting facility property and equipment 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  and the costs of marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our executive management and our finance  administration  information technology  and human resources personnel 
general and administrative expenses also include research and development expense  depreciation  bad debt expense and operating expenses such as rent  insurance  telephones  office supplies  travel  outside professional services  training  and facilities costs 
we have historically derived and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients who may change from year to year 
any cancellation  deferral  or significant reduction in work performed for our principal clients could harm our business and cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
as a result of our investments  infrastructure buildup and increase in operating expenses in and  we incurred a net loss in and anticipate incurring a net loss in further  our quarterly revenue  cost of revenues  and operating results have varied in the past due to fluctuations in the utilization of project personnel and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to a significant softening demand across our industry sector  we initiated an organizational restructuring to more effectively address these changing market conditions 
this restructuring included a reduction in workforce of employees  or of the overall employee base  for which we incurred a charge of million 
this reduction included of the sg a headcount  of application management service workforce  and of billable consultants 
the restructuring also included a client focused organizational realignment 
also in the fourth quarter of  we took a charge associated with the write off of million in accounts receivable 
the collectablity of these receivables had become impaired as a result of a general tightening in the credit and capital markets for many of our clients  including certain dot com companies  adversely affecting funding opportunities for these clients

we believe that current cash balances and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we may need additional financing to fund our cash requirements beyond months

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instructions and hedging activities 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instructions and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted these standards on january  and believe that such adoption will not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in march the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb 
this interpretation clarifies the application of apb no 
by clarifying the definition of an employee  the determination of non compensatory plans and the effect of modifications to stock options 
this interpretation was effective july  and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations  and we assume no obligation to update these statements 
because actual results may differ materially from expectations  we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements 
these statements are based on our estimates  projections  beliefs  and assumptions  and are not guarantees of future performance 
a number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results  or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us 
these factors include a reduced demand for internet services  the loss of one or more of our significant clients  an inability to increase our market share  difficulties in maintaining our technology alliances  and a continued downturn in economic conditions 
these factors and the other matters discussed above under the heading factors that may affect future results and our stock price in item of this report may cause future results to differ materially from historical results  or from results or outcomes we currently expect or seek 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial 
all of our revenues are realized currently in us dollars and are from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
