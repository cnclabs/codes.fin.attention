item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations all comparisons under this heading between  and refer to the week periods ended september  and october   and the week period ended october   respectively  unless otherwise indicated 
revenues company operated restaurant sales were  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
in  restaurant sales included approximately million from an additional rd week 
restaurant sales improved from the prior year by million  or  in and million  or  in  reflecting increases in the number of company operated restaurants and in per store average psa sales 
the number of company operated restaurants at the end of the fiscal year grew to  in from  in and  in with new restaurant openings of  and  respectively 
psa weekly sales for comparable company restaurants increased in  in and in compared to the respective prior year  due to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amounts 
we believe restaurant sales improvements have resulted from our two tier marketing strategy featuring both premium sandwiches and value priced alternatives  as well as to a popular brand building advertising campaign that features our fictional founder  jack 
also contributing to sales growth were price increases and our strategic initiatives  including our ongoing focus on food quality and guest service 
distribution and other sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to is primarily due to increases in the number of restaurants serviced by our distribution division and psa sales growth at franchised restaurants 
the million increase in compared to is due principally to an increase in the number of fuel and convenience stores we operate 
franchise rents and royalties were million  million and million in  and  respectively  or  and  respectively of sales at franchise operated restaurants 
franchise restaurant sales were million in  million in and million in the percentage of sales in and grew primarily due to increases in percentage rents at certain franchised restaurants 
other revenues  representing franchise gains and fees and interest income from investments and notes receivable  increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily due to increased franchising activities 
costs and expenses restaurant costs of sales and operating costs increased with sales growth and the addition of company operated restaurants 
restaurant costs of sales  which include food and packaging costs  increased to million in from million in and million in as a percent of restaurant sales  costs of sales were in  in and in the restaurant costs of sales percentage improved in and compared to prior years primarily due to favorable overall ingredient costs and selling price increases 
restaurant operating costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we reduced accrued liabilities and restaurant operating costs by million  primarily due to a change in estimates resulting from improvements to our asset protection and risk management programs  which were more successful than anticipated 
this change in estimates was supported by an independent actuarial study conducted to evaluate the self insured portion of our workers compensation  general liability and other insurance programs 
restaurant operating costs were of restaurant sales in  in and in  excluding the change in estimates 
the restaurant operating costs percentage increased in compared to  reflecting an increase in occupancy costs  principally utilities and to a lesser extent higher labor related expenses 
the percentage in increased compared to  primarily reflecting costs related to initiatives designed to improve the overall guest experience and slightly higher labor related costs 
costs of distribution and other sales were million in  million in and million in  reflecting an increase in the related sales 
as a percent of distribution and other sales  these costs improved to in  from in and in  primarily due to improved margins from our fuel and convenience store operations resulting from our revised fuel pricing strategy and a decrease in start up costs

advertising and promotion costs were million in  million in and million in  just over of restaurant sales in all years 
general  administrative and other costs were approximately of revenues in  in and in the percentage improvement in compared to is primarily due to lower bonus and pension expenses 
the higher percentage in reflects costs associated with the implementation of guest initiatives  accelerated restaurant growth and higher incentive compensation and pension expense 
interest expense declined to million in from million in and million in the reduction in compared to is principally due to lower average interest rates 
the reduction in compared to is principally due to a reduction in total debt outstanding 
the tax provisions reflect effective annual tax rates of  and of pre tax earnings in  and  respectively 
the favorable income tax rates in each year have resulted from our ability to realize previously unrecognized tax benefits such as business tax credit  tax loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
also contributing to the effective rate decline in was our settlement with the us internal revenue service of a tax case related to the disposition in november of our interest in family restaurants  inc we recognized tax benefits of million  primarily as a result of this settlement 
in  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab which requires that franchise percentage rents  which are coningent upon certain annual sales levels  be recognized in the period in which the contingency is met instead of being accrued for ratably 
as a result of adopting sab  we recorded a one time after tax cumulative effect of this accounting change of million related to the deferral of franchise percentage rents not yet earned as of the beginning of fiscal year net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in each year includes unusual items 
in  net earnings included the aforementioned million charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change  or 
per diluted share 
in  we reached a final agreement with the us internal revenue service to settle a tax case as described above 
this settlement increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share 
in  restaurant operating costs were reduced by million due to a change in estimates as described above 
this change in estimates increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share  net of income taxes 
in addition  included a rd week that contributed an extra million in net earnings  or 
per diluted share 
excluding these unusual items  net earnings increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in  which had increased from million  or per diluted share  in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased 
million to approximately million at september  from approximately million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we expect to maintain low levels of cash and cash equivalents  reinvesting available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
our working capital deficit decreased million to million at september  from million at october   principally due to an increase in accounts receivable and assets held for sale and leaseback  offset in part by an increase in total current liabilities 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
our revolving bank credit agreement provides for a credit facility expiring in of up to million  including letters of credit of up to million 
at september   we had borrowings of million and approximately million of availability under the agreement 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of fiscal year we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
in september  the collateral securing the bank credit facility was released 
real and personal property previously held as collateral for the bank credit facility cannot be used to secure other indebtedness of the company 
in addition  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
our primary sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include financing opportunities and the conversion of company operated restaurants to franchised restaurants 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that sufficient cash flows will be generated from operations so that  combined with available financing alternatives  we will be able to meet our debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
although we cannot determine with certainty the amount of liability from claims and actions described in note of the consolidated financial statements  we believe the ultimate liability for such claims and actions should not materially affect our results of operations and liquidity 
on december   our board of directors authorized the purchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market for an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
through september   we had acquired  shares in connection with this authorization for an aggregate cost of million 
seasonality our restaurant sales and profitability are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are traditionally higher during the spring and summer months because of factors such as increased travel and improved weather conditions which affect the public s dining habits 
future accounting changes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersede accounting principles board opinion  intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet one of the two criteria  as defined in the statement 
this statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are to be tested at least annually for impairment 
separable intangible assets with defined lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the provisions of sfas will apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired before and after the statement s effective date 
this new standard is required to be adopted by the first quarter of fiscal year  although we may elect to adopt it in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the effect that such adoption will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this new standard requires entities to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
when the liability is initially incurred  the cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period through charges to operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the life of the asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adoption of sfas in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this new standard supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this statement were to develop one accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues related to sfas statement requires that all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adoption of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
our million credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   our applicable margin was 
in fiscal year  the average interest rate paid on the credit facility was approximately  including the impact of an interest rate swap which expired in june at september   a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of 
million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based on holding our bank debt at its september  level 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
from time to time we enter into commodity futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
open commodity futures and option contracts were not significant as of september  at september   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
