recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
our investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps  forward or futures contracts 
our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on borrowings under our credit facility  which are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate 
we also have an outstanding promissory note issued in favor of xenova discovery limited at the libor rate plus one percent and a change in the applicable interest rate on these loans would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds 
the aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those borrowings held by us at december   which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates is approximately  after tax 
the hypothetical loss was determined by financial instruments held by us at december  fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations
