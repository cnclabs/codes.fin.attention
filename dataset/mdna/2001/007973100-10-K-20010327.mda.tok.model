item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
for example  statements relating to our beliefs  expectations and plans are forward looking statements  as are statements that certain actions  conditions or circumstances will continue 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or prove any forward looking statements  by hindsight  to be overly optimistic or unachievable  include  but are not limited to the following o the significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  o the volatility of the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  o timing and success of integration of recent and potential future acquisitions  and o supply constraints and technological changes 
for a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward looking statements  see part i cautionary statements risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and support products and systems critical to plasma based manufacturing processes 
these systems are important components of industrial manufacturing equipment that modifies surfaces or deposits or etches thin film layers on computer chips  cds  flat panel displays such as computer screens  dvds  windows  eyeglasses and other products 
we market and sell our systems primarily to large global oems of semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing equipment and for manufacturers of other products in advanced product applications markets 
we recognize revenues upon shipment of our systems 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry accounted for approximately of our sales in  in and in we have been successful in achieving a number of design wins each year  which have resulted in our obtaining new customers and solidifying relationships with our existing customers 
we believe our ability to continue to achieve design wins with existing and potential customers will be critical to our future success 
we continue to seek to expand our product offerings and customer base through internal development and acquisitions 
we took a step towards achieving further market penetration in september when we acquired the assets of fourth state technology  inc this acquisition enhanced our capability to design and manufacture rf power related process control systems used to monitor and analyze data in thin film etch processes 
in october we acquired rf power products  inc rfpp  which designs  manufactures and supports rf power conversion and control systems  consisting of generators and matching networks 
we believe our ability to offer an expanded line of rf systems to our existing customer base has strengthened our relationships 
we sell these products principally to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers 
we also sell similar systems to capital equipment manufacturers in the flat panel display and thin film data storage industries 
in april we changed the name of rfpp to advanced energy voorhees  inc and conduct business under that name 
in october we acquired a majority interest in litmas  a company that designs and manufactures plasma gas abatement systems and high density plasma sources 
in november we completed two underwritten public offerings  one for million of convertible subordinated notes  and one for  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share 
these offerings provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in december we completed formation of our wholly owned sales and service subsidiary in taiwan 
in march we formed a strategic partnership with symphony systems  a supplier of network based applications and open architecture software solutions to the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  to deliver an advanced network based infrastructure to our customers 
in april we acquired noah holdings  inc noah  which manufactures solid state temperature control systems to control process temperatures during semiconductor manufacturing 
in june we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with berkeley process control  inc  a manufacturer of integrated motion and machine control technologies 
in july we entered into an agreement to acquire emco  which manufactures electronic and electromechanical precision instruments for measuring and controlling the flow of liquids  steam and gases 
emco became a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced energy in january in august we acquired sekidenko  inc sekidenko  which supplies optical fiber thermometers to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
in october we opened a representative office in shenzhen  china  to be responsible for market development  sales and technical support in china 
in october and november we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes on the open market  leaving us with million of such long term debt outstanding 
these purchases resulted in an after tax net extraordinary gain of million 
in november we entered into a strategic investment agreement with dressler hf technik gmbh  a privately held supplier of rf power solutions for plasma based applications located in germany

we also sell spare parts and repair services worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to our sales increases were due to increased unit sales 
a substantial portion of our sales growth from to was due to higher system sales to our four largest customers  two of whom are primarily semiconductor capital equipment oems  one of whom is a data storage oem  and one of whom is a flat panel display oem 
our sales in reflected the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry from the severe downturn of  and resulted from capacity expansion and increased investment in advanced technology by the semiconductor industry 
this recovery and expansion resulted in record sales for us in it also resulted in record sales for us in to the semiconductor capital equipment industry specifically 
this recovery continued into  and resulted in another record year of sales for us in total and to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
our experience has shown that our sales to semiconductor capital equipment customers is dependent on the volatility of that industry  as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand  and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry in increased over sales to that industry in sales to the data storage industry increased from to sales to the flat panel display industry increased from to sales to advanced product applications industries decreased from to our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry in increased over sales to that industry in sales to the data storage industry increased from to sales to the flat panel display industry increased from to sales to advanced product applications industries increased from to the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by customer type for us for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands semiconductor capital equipment    data storage    flat panel display    advanced product applications    customer service technical support    years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment data storage flat panel display advanced product applications customer service technical support the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by geographic region for us for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands united states and canada    europe    asia pacific    rest of world years ended december  united states and canada europe asia pacific rest of world gross margin our gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross margin from to was primarily a result of our efforts to reduce material costs  improve overhead cost controls and a more favorable absorption of manufacturing costs which resulted from the higher sales base 
the improvement in gross margin from to was primarily a result of a more favorable absorption of manufacturing costs  which resulted from the higher sale base 
we added new facilities in fort collins  colorado in the first quarter of to increase our manufacturing capacity 
due to substantial fixed costs involved in this expansion  there could be an adverse impact on overhead absorption in if the increased capacity is not fully utilized 
in the fourth quarter of the semiconductor capital equipment industry entered a sudden and severe downturn which continued through the end of the downturn in this industry  with the resulting underutilization of capacity  significantly impacted our financial results for the combination of the expansion and lower sales resulted in an over capacity situation for us  leading to unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and a substantially reduced margin 
this underutilization of manufacturing capacity continued to negatively impact gross margins  until sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market recovered in and historically  price competition has not had a material effect on margins 
however  competitive pressures may produce a decline in average selling prices for certain products 
any decline in average selling prices not offset by reduced costs could result in a decline in our gross margins 
we provide warranty coverage for our systems ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our systems under such warranties based on the historical average costs of the repairs 
to date  we have not experienced significant warranty costs in excess of our recorded reserves 
research and development we invest in research and development to identify new technologies  develop new products and improve existing product designs 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in and decreased again to in because of the increasingly higher sales base 
the increase in expenses from to is primarily due to increases in payroll  materials and supplies and depreciation of equipment used for new product development 
we believe continued investment in the research and development of new systems is critical to our ability to serve new and existing markets  and we continue to invest in new product development during industry downturns 
since our inception  the majority of our research and development costs generally have been internally funded and all have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities which include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this represents a increase from to and a increase from to the increase in expenses from to is primarily due to higher payroll  commissions  promotion  distribution and travel costs 
we incurred these expenses to continue to increase our sales management and product management capabilities 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in and decreased again to in because of the increasingly higher sales base  while dollars spent increased 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide financial  administrative  information systems and human resources functions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this represents a increase from to and a increase from to the increases from to are primarily due to higher spending for payroll and purchased services 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in and decreased again to in because of the increasingly higher sales base 
we continue to implement our management system software  including the replacement of existing systems in our domestic and foreign locations 
we expect that charges related to personnel training and implementation of the new software will continue into restructuring and merger costs and one time credit in we recorded a million recovery  which represented a settlement with our insurance carrier related to storm damage to our headquarters and main manufacturing facilities in the fort collins area in we had previously recorded million of storm damages in in august we announced a restructuring plan to respond to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
the plan included a reduction of workforce of people  the closure of one facility in our fort collins  colorado campus  and the abandonment of plans to construct a new manufacturing facility in fort collins 
we achieved other reductions in workforce at the voorhees facility throughout we took a charge of million for the restructuring in the third quarter of on october   advanced energy acquired rf power products  inc  accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction that involved the exchange of four million shares of advanced energy common stock for the publicly held common stock of rfpp 
as part of the business combination  we incurred million of expense recorded in the fourth quarter of for merger costs 
we incurred additional operating expenses during relating to consolidating and integrating operations of this business combination 
on april   advanced energy acquired noah holdings  inc in a pooling of interests transaction that involved the exchange of approximately  shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of noah 
as part of the business combination  we incurred million of expense in the second quarter of for merger costs 
we incurred additional operating expenses during and expect to incur further operating expenses in relating to consolidating and integrating operations of this business combination 
on july   we announced the consolidation of our tower  inc  facility in fridley  minnesota  into our existing facility in voorhees  new jersey 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of related to the consolidation  which was completed during the fourth quarter of on august   advanced energy acquired sekidenko  inc  in a merger that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this merger involved the exchange of million shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of sekidenko 
as part of the business combination  we took a charge of million in the third quarter of for merger costs 
we incurred additional operating expenses during and expect to incur further operating expenses in relating to consolidating and integrating operations of this business combination 
the million of merger costs incurred in and million of merger costs incurred in cannot be capitalized  and in certain cases are nondeductible for income tax purposes 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
in interest income was earned primarily from earnings on investments made from the proceeds of our initial public offering in and our underwritten public offering in in and interest income was earned primarily from the proceeds of our offering of convertible subordinated notes and common stock offering of november interest expense consists principally of accruals of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  on borrowings under our bank credit and capital lease facilities and a state government loan 
interest expense was approximately  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the increase of interest expense from to was primarily due to interest on the convertible subordinated notes 
our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of  and million for and  respectively  and a net foreign currency loss of  in the increase from to was primarily due to strengthening of the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
the loss in was due to a weakening of the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar offset by the effect of our use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
since we have entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various policies to minimize the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
eleven european countries adopted a single european currency the euro as of january  with a transition period continuing through at least january  as of january   these eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
for three years after the introduction of the euro  the participating countries can perform financial transactions in either the euro or their original local currencies 
this will result in a fixed exchange rate among the participating countries  whereas the euro and the participating countries currencies in tandem will continue to float freely against the us dollar and other currencies of non participating countries 
a twelfth european country adopted the euro on january  although we do not expect the introduction of the euro currency to have a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations  we are unable to determine what effects  if any  the currency change in europe will have on competition and competitive pricing in the affected regions 
miscellaneous expense items were  and  in and  respectively 
miscellaneous income of million in was primarily due to a million gain on a sale of an investment 
provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit for was million and represented an effective tax rate of 
the income tax provision of million for represented an effective rate of 
the income tax provision of million in  which included million of provision for an extraordinary item  represented an effective rate of 
changes in our relative earnings and the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries affect our consolidated effective tax rate 
we adjust our income taxes periodically based upon the anticipated tax status of all foreign and domestic entities 
extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter of we repurchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market  for a cost of approximately million 
these purchases resulted in a pretax extraordinary gain of million  or million after tax 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

net income we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the level of our revenues in a particular quarter 
these factors include o general economic conditions  o specific economic conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries and other industries in which our customers operate  o timing and nature of orders from major customers  o changes in customers inventory management practices  o customer cancellations of previously placed orders and shipment delays  o pricing competition from our competitors  o costs incurred by responding to specific feature requests by customers  o component shortages resulting in manufacturing delays  o exchange rate fluctuations  o management decisions to commence or discontinue product lines  o our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis  o the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  o the timing of research and development expenditures  and o expenses related to acquisitions  strategic alliances  and the further development of marketing and service capabilities 
we are dependent on obtaining orders for shipment in a particular quarter to achieve our revenue objectives for that quarter 
accordingly  it is difficult for us to predict accurately the timing and level of sales in a particular quarter 
we anticipate quarterly fluctuations in sales to continue 
our quarterly operating results in and reflect the changing demand for our products during this period  principally from manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment  data storage equipment and flat panel displays  and our ability to adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet this demand 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry increased each quarter throughout and data storage sales were flat from the first quarter of to the second quarter of  then increased in the third and fourth quarters of data storage sales then decreased in the first and second quarters of  increased in the third quarter of and decreased in the fourth quarter of sales to the flat panel display industry increased each quarter of and sales to advanced product applications markets  though fluctuating on a quarterly basis throughout and  were higher in the second half of than in the first half of  were higher again in the first half of and again in the second half of our revenue from all sectors is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in each of the industries we serve 
our gross margin improved on a quarterly basis in and reached a relatively consistent level in each of the quarters in gross margin improved from in the first quarter of to in the second quarter of  then improved to in the third quarter of and to in the fourth quarter of these increases were due to increased utilization of capacity from the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and from our increased efforts to lower material costs 
gross margin improved slightly to in the first quarter of and again to in the second and fourth quarters of  with a slight decrease to in the third quarter of operating expenses were million  million  million and million during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  but declined as a percentage of sales throughout as the sales base increased each quarter 
operating expenses excluding restructuring and merger costs were million  million  million and million during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring and merger costs  declined as a percentage of sales in the first and second quarters of  and increased slightly as a percentage of sales in the third and fourth quarters of as a percentage of sales  operating expenses have generally declined during periods of rapid sales growth  when sales increased at a rate faster than our ability to add personnel and facilities to support the growth 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales have generally increased during periods of flat or decreased sales  when our infrastructure is retained to support anticipated future growth 
other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency gain and loss  and miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income and expense increased significantly in the fourth quarter of  when the interest income and expense from the proceeds of the convertible subordinated notes and the interest from the proceeds of the common stock sale began 
interest income and expense stayed at higher levels throughout during we recorded a net foreign exchange gain of million  which occurred mostly in the second half of the year  and in we recorded a  foreign currency loss 
we continue to utilize forward foreign exchange contracts in japan to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
the third quarter of included a million gain on a sale of an investment 
our effective rate for income tax provision fluctuated throughout and  varying from to 
the fluctuations were due to certain nondeductible expenses including merger costs  and due to initiatives we implemented in to reduce our overall rate 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations  acquired equipment and met our working capital requirements through borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  long term loans secured by property and equipment  cash flow from operations and proceeds from underwritten public offerings of our common stock and convertible subordinated debt 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of net income  depreciation  amortization  increases in accounts payable and increased accruals for payroll  employee benefits and income taxes  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of net income  depreciation  amortization and increases in accounts payable and increased accruals for payroll  employee benefits and income taxes  partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories  gains on retirement of convertible subordinated notes and a sale of an investment  and earnings from marketable securities 
we expect future receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
we are required to maintain higher levels of buffer stock inventory to satisfy our customers delivery requirements 
any increase in our inventory levels will require the use of cash to finance the inventory 
investing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of a net increase in marketable securities of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and an addition to an investment of  investing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted of a net decrease in marketable securities of million  proceeds from a sale of an investment of million and proceeds from a sale of equipment of  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million  a purchase of technology of million and an addition to an investment of  financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted of net proceeds from convertible subordinated debt of million  net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan espp of million  and other proceeds of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of open market repurchases of our convertible notes of million and other uses of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
in the fourth quarter of we repurchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market  for a cost of approximately million 
the note purchases were funded from our available cash 
we may repurchase additional notes in the open market from time to time  if market conditions and our financial position are deemed favorable for such purchases 
we plan to spend approximately million in for the acquisition of equipment  leasehold improvements and furnishings  with depreciation expense for projected to be million 
in january we used cash to purchase the outstanding common stock of emco for approximately million 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  with options to convert up to million to a three year term loan 
advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at either the prime rate at february  minus or the libor day rate at february  plus basis points  at our option 
all advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable april  as of december  there was an advance outstanding of  to our japanese subsidiary  advanced energy japan kk we also had another line of credit of million of which there was no balance outstanding at december  this credit line expired in january we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through at least the end of after that time  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital  capital equipment or expansion needs 
in addition  any significant acquisitions we make may require additional equity or debt financing to fund the purchase price  if paid in cash 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when required or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and mutual funds 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
we have entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations 
at december   we held foreign forward exchange contracts with nominal amounts of million and market settlement amounts of million for an unrealized gain position of  other risk we have invested in a start up company and may in the future make additional investments in start up companies that develop products which we believe may provide future benefits 
the current start up investment and any future start up investments will be subject to all of the risks inherent in investing in companies that are not established
