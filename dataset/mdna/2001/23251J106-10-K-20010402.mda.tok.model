item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we commenced operations in march as a division of beyond 
com 
on december   beyond 
com transferred assets and liabilities related to its commerce transaction processing services division to cybersource 
our statements of operations and stockholders equity for reflect our operations as a division of beyond 
com through december  our statements of operations for include all revenues and costs directly attributable to us  including a corporate allocation of the costs of facilities  salaries and employee benefits 
additionally  incremental corporate administration  finance and management costs were allocated to us 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and through december  had incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
the company derives its revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees  support service fees  professional services and the sale of enterprise software licenses and related maintenance 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur 
professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
enterprise software license and maintenance revenue is recognized when all elements of a contract have been delivered 
the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence for license or maintenance revenue 
for enterprise software arrangements where maintenance is the only undelivered element  the company recognizes the entire contract ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
for the year ended december   one customer accounted for of revenue 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results  including our gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  we do not believe that our historical growth rates are indicative of future results 
even if our revenues and number of transactions did continue to expand at a steady pace in absolute numbers  our growth rate would decrease 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the acquisition of expressgold 
com  inc expressgold which was completed in january and was accounted for as a pooling of interests as well as the acquisition of paylinx corporation paylinx for the period from september   the date of acquisition  which was accounted for under purchase accounting

amounts allocated to in process technology were calculated using established valuation techniques in the high technology industry 
in process technology consisted of enhancements to paylinx s payment and fraud products  which were estimated to be approximately and complete  respectively  as of the date of acquisition 
these enhancements have since been completed 
in process technology was expensed in the quarter ended september   when the acquisition was consummated  because technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been achieved and no alternative future uses had been established 
in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream to be generated by the purchased technology

income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded as we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are not able to use them  the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such an ownership change 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the reliability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and revenues

interest income expense  net

income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded as we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by approximately million from december  to december  this decrease resulted from recording a million net loss and million of purchases of property and equipment  offset by the recording of non cash charges of million of in process research and development acquired from paylinx and million of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  we acquired million of cash upon completion of our acquisition of paylinx 
net cash used in our operating activities was approximately million in and approximately million in net cash used in operations during consists primarily of our net loss of million  increases in current assets and decreases in current liabilities  offset by the recording of a million non cash in process research and development charge in connection with our acquisition of paylinx  depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in deferred revenue primarily related to the sale of enterprise software and related software maintenance

net cash provided by financing activities in of million consists primarily of proceeds from our initial and second public offerings which total approximately million 
we believe that our cash and short term investment balances as of december  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect that we will continue to use our cash to fund expected operating losses 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the level of investment we make in new businesses  new products or new technologies 
we currently have no agreements or understandings with respect to any future investments or acquisitions 
to the extent that our existing cash resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to our stockholders and us

all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and the we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
these cautionary statements should be considered in the context of the risk factors listed below  as well as those disclosed from time to time in our reports on forms q and k 
additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include the following we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early stage companies we commenced operations in march from march until december  we operated as a division of beyond 
com 
in december  we were incorporated as a separate legal entity and our company was spun off from beyond 
com 
accordingly  we have a very limited operating history  and our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties to which early stage companies are particularly exposed 
these risks include 
risks that the intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry could adversely affect market acceptance of all of our services  
risks that we may not be able to expand our systems to handle increased traffic  resulting in slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  
risks that we may not be able to fully utilize relationships with our strategic partners and indirect sales channels  and 
risks that any fluctuations in our quarterly operating results will be significant relative to our revenues  and 
risks that we may not be able to adequately integrate acquired businesses  including paylinx  which was acquired on september  these risks are discussed in more detail below 
we cannot assure you that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and the risks detailed below 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability although our revenues have increased on a quarterly basis since  we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had incurred cumulative losses of million 
you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance 
we do not expect to sustain similar levels of growth in future periods 
we have continued to increase our sales and marketing  network infrastructure  product development and general and administrative expenses in as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 
the expected fluctuations of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline we expect that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future based upon a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
we plan to further increase our operating expenses as we integrate paylinx  expand our sales and marketing activities and broaden our service capabilities 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated market growth and our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues are lower than we expect  our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the following 
changes in the number of transactions affected by our customers  especially as a result of seasonality  success of each customer s business  general economic conditions or regulatory requirements restricting our customers  
our ability to attract new customers and to retain our existing merchants  
customer acceptance of our pricing model  
customer acceptance of our software and our professional services offerings  
the success of our sales and marketing programs  
an interruption with one or more of our gateway processors and channel partners  
seasonality of the retail sector  and 
continued softening of the general us economy and the lack of available capital for our customers and potential future customers 
other factors that may affect our quarterly results are set forth elsewhere in this section 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
revenues from professional services in the year ended december  may not be sustainable in the year ended december   we experienced strong growth in the demand for our professional services and were engaged to complete a large project with related revenue in the amount of approximately million 
in order to satisfy this demand  we committed internal resources  hired a significant number of additional professional services personnel and hired independent contractors 
we may not be engaged for additional projects of similar or larger size and the demand for professional services may decrease 
for instance  professional services revenue decreased from million for the three months ended december  as compared to million during the three months ended september  in addition  if we are engaged for additional projects of similar or larger size  we may not be able to hire the resources necessary to meet future demand 
as a result  our revenues from professional services could decrease significantly 
during the year ended december   one customer for which we performed a non recurring professional services engagement accounted for of our revenues 
we may have an accounts receivable concentration risk at times our professional services business was a larger percentage of our total revenue in compared to some of our professional services engagements are large projects and result in higher concentration of our accounts receivable balance at times 
for example  as of june   approximately of our accounts receivable balance was due from one professional services customer 
no customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance as of december  we expect to continue to experience this concentration risk in connection with our professional services business 
some of our larger customers have businesses that focus on the internet and may not be able to obtain necessary funding a significant number of our customers have internet based business models 
some of these customers are among our largest customers 
many of these customers may require substantial working capital to operate their businesses  may not have adequate funds available and may be dependent upon the capital markets for funding 
our customers may not be able to raise the additional capital required to fund their businesses and  as a result  we may experience a decrease in our customer base  a reduction in recurring revenue and an increase in our bad debt expense 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and our business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses as part of our overall business strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies that would provide additional service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
for instance  in september we completed our acquisition of paylinx  a developer of a payment server platform for real time credit card transactions 
we have no experience in integrating or operating a payment server business and cannot give assurance that we will be successful in integrating and operating this business into cybersource 
if we do not successfully integrate paylinx  or if the benefits of the paylinx transaction do not meet the expectation of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
any future acquisition could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect the business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including 
difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of paylinx or another acquired company  
the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experiences such as the enterprise software market  
the potential loss of key employees of paylinx or another acquired company 
the demand for our services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall sales of goods and services 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and internationally 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a relatively recent development 
in particular  the sale of goods and services over the internet has gained acceptance more slowly outside of the united states 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
the emergence of the internet as a commercial marketplace may occur more slowly than anticipated for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
if the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  continues to grow  it may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect 
these factors could result in slower response times or adversely affect usage of the internet  resulting in lower numbers of commerce transactions and lower demand for our services 
potential system failures and lack of capacity issues could negatively affect demand for our services our ability to deliver services to our merchants depends on the uninterrupted operation of our commerce transaction processing systems 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 
earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  
power loss  telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by employees  physical and electronic break ins and similar events  and 
computer viruses 
despite the fact that we have implemented redundant servers in third party hosting centers located in santa clara  california  we may still experience service interruptions for the reasons listed above and a variety of other reasons 
if our redundant servers are not available  we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for resulting losses 
we have experienced periodic interruptions  affecting all or a portion of our systems  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
for example  on november   our services were unavailable for approximately ten hours due to an internal system problem 
in addition  any interruption in our systems that impairs our ability to provide services could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our success also depends on our ability to grow  or scale  our commerce transaction systems to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic on our systems  especially during peak periods of demand 
we may not be able to anticipate increases in the use of our systems and successfully expand the capacity of our network infrastructure 
our inability to expand our systems to handle increased traffic could result in system disruptions  slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  which could materially harm our business 
a breach of our commerce security measures could reduce demand for our services a requirement of the continued growth of commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and a private key  for encoding and decoding data  and digital certificate technology  or identity verification  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the most secure cryptographic protection available and thereby expose us to an increased risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our operations 
any compromise or elimination of security could reduce demand for our services 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and to address any problems they may cause 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations 
the intense competition in our industry could reduce or eliminate the demand for our services the market for our services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our primary source of competition comes from online merchants that develop custom systems 
these online merchants  who have made large initial investments to develop custom systems  may be less likely to adopt an outsourced transaction processing strategy 
we also face competition from developers of other systems for commerce transaction processing such as clear commerce  cybercash  digital river  e one global an affiliate of first data corporation  hewlett packard verifone  hnc software  open market  shopnow 
com and verisign 
in addition  other companies  including financial services and credit companies such as first data corporation  at t and ge  may enter the market and provide similar services 
in the future  we may also compete with large internet centric companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from commerce and may offer  or provide a means for others to offer  commerce transaction services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
for example  microsoft and cybercash have each introduced electronic wallet solutions that  if widely adopted by consumers  may reduce demand for our fraud screening services 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future channel partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell services through these channels 
we expect that competitive pressures will result in the reduction of our prices or our market share or both  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel  including william s 
mckiernan  our chief executive officer  and other key members of management because of their experience and knowledge regarding the development  special opportunities and challenges of our business 
none of our current key employees is subject to an employment contract 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key employees in the future 
our future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified marketing  sales and technical personnel 
competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting marketing  sales  engineering and support personnel 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly marketing  sales and technical personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 
difficulties managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations we have experienced a period of rapid and substantial growth that has placed a strain on our administrative infrastructure 
we have increased the number of employees from employees at december  to employees at december   employees at december  and at december  this expansion placed a significant strain on our managerial and financial resources 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we reduced the number of employees by approximately as we restructured and realigned our resources to better manage and control our business 
during  we expended significant time and resources in developing our management information and control systems and business plan  which was completed toward the end of during  we implemented an enterprise resource planning system and a customer relationship management system 
in the future  we may not be able to enhance our management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
in addition  we may not be able to hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel or to successfully identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
if we are not able to fully utilize relationships with our sales alliances  we may experience lower revenue growth and higher operating costs our future growth will depend in part on the success of our relationships with existing and future sales alliances that market our services to their merchant accounts 
if these relationships are not successful or do not develop as quickly as we anticipate  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
accordingly  we may have to increase our sales and marketing expenses in an attempt to secure additional merchant accounts 
our management team must work together effectively in order to expand our business  increase our revenues and improve our operating results several of our existing senior management personnel have joined us within the last year 
as a result  there is a risk that management will not be able to work together effectively as a team to address the challenges to our business 
our new employees include a number of key managerial  technical and operations personnel 
in addition  our chief financial officer left the company in march and we are currently searching for a replacement 
we may also need to add additional key personnel in the near future who will also need to be integrated into our management team 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete  we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our services and the underlying network infrastructure 
the internet and the e commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology and systems obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing services and develop new services 
we must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our merchants  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to develop new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to merchant requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  merchant requirements or emerging industry standards  our business would be materially harmed 
our current and prior overlapping board members with beyond 
com corporation may create conflicts of interests and result in actions inconsistent with stockholder interests in connection with our spin off from beyond 
com corporation beyond 
com in december  we entered into agreements with beyond 
com to define the ongoing relationship between the two companies 
at the time these agreements were negotiated  all of our directors were also directors of beyond 
com and other members of our management team were also executive officers of beyond 
com 
as a result  these agreements were not the result of arms length negotiations between us and beyond 
com 
further  although we and beyond 
com are engaged in different businesses  the two companies currently have no policies to govern the pursuit or allocation of corporate opportunities  in the event they arise 
our business could be adversely affected if the overlapping board members of the two companies  of which there are currently two  william s 
mckiernan and richard scudellari  pursue beyond 
com s interests over ours either in the course of transactions between the companies or where the same corporate opportunities are available to both companies 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology and may be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we also cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that the technology employed in providing our current or future services infringe upon their rights 
we have not conducted any search to determine whether any of our services or technologies may be infringing upon patent rights of third parties 
as the number of services in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
in addition  these claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could absorb significant management time and lead to costly litigation 
if required to do so  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us 
see business intellectual property and legal proceedings for more information relating to protecting our intellectual property rights and risks relating to claims of infringement upon the intellectual property of others 
we may not be able to secure funding in the future necessary to operate our business as planned we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect to use the net proceeds of our equity financings to continue investments in service development  to expand sales and marketing activities  to fund product development  to fund continued operations and potentially to make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand our merchant base  the growth of sales and marketing and other factors 
if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that would adversely affect our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to commerce 
however  due to the increasing usage of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet covering issues such as 
taxes  
user privacy  
pricing  
content  
right to access personal data  
copyrights  
distribution  and 
characteristics and quality of services 
for example  we believe that some of our services may require us to comply with the fair credit reporting act 
as a precaution  we are implementing changes to our systems and processes so that we will be in compliance with the act 
complying with this act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us or our merchants 
failure to comply with this act could result in claims being made against us 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes in the united states regarding taxation and encryption and in the european union regarding contract formation and privacy  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace and impose additional costs and other burdens 
these uncertainties  costs and burdens could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
our international business exposes us to additional foreign risks services provided to merchants outside the united states accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc and established cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
we intend to expand our international presence in the future 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to additional risks that may affect our ability to sell our services and result in reduced revenues  including 
changes in regulatory requirements  
reduced protection of intellectual property rights  
evolving privacy laws in europe  
the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and 
political or economic instability or constraints on international trade 
in addition  some software contains encryption technology that renders it subject to export restrictions and we may become liable to the extent we violate these restrictions 
we might not successfully market  sell and distribute our services in local markets and we cannot be certain that one or more of these factors will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business  financial condition and operating results 
also  sales of our services conducted through our subsidiary in the united kingdom are denominated in pounds sterling 
we may experience fluctuations in revenues or operating expenses due to fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into transactions with the specific purpose to hedge against currency exchange fluctuations 
existing stockholders may exert control over us to the detriment of minority stockholders at december   our officers  directors and principal stockholders ie  greater than stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  are able to control our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of cybersource and might affect the market price of our common stock 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially the market price for the common stock will be affected by a number of factors  including the following 
the announcement of new services or service enhancements by us or our competitors  
quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  
changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  
developments in our industry  and 
general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control of cybersource more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in the management and control of cybersource 
under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
one anti takeover provision that we have is the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
our partnership agreement with visa usa expires in august and visa usa may elect to terminate the partnership agreement the agreement we entered into in july with visa usa to jointly develop and promote cybersource internet fraud screen enhanced by visa for use in the united states expires in august the agreement will be automatically extended thereafter until terminated by either party 
visa has agreed to promote and market the new product to its member financial institutions and internet merchants 
during the term of the agreement  we cannot enter into any development or consultation agreements with certain competitors of visa in the area of internet fraud detection 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
all sales are currently made in us dollars or pound sterling 
a strengthening of the us dollar or the pound sterling could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are primarily money market funds and commercial paper  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
