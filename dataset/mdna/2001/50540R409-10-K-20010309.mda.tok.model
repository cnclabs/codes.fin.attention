the company continues to emphasize customer satisfaction and expanding those laboratory services which offer the greatest benefit to patients  clinicians  and the company 
while the company experienced solid growth in all areas  particular growth was noted in the areas of molecular testing for hiv and hepatitis c  genetic testing and oncology testing 
the company implemented important new contracts with cigna healthcare  aetna and unitedhealthcare  the three largest national managed care companies 
these agreements provide the company expanded opportunities to increase business in new products and key markets 
in addition  the company s agreements with healthtrust purchasing group and amerinet expand its reach to many new hospitals  surgery centers  clinics  and physicians  representing a significant revenue opportunity

the company believes that ngi s reputation with leading biotech and pharmaceutical firms will continue to play an important role helping to expand the company s clinical testing opportunities 
in addition to hepatitis c  ngi is developing assays for melanoma and breast cancer  two areas targeted by many companies for new drug development

with this population growth  increased demand for testing is anticipated in these areas and management believes the company is well positioned to benefit from this increased demand 
the aging of america and the increase in life expectancy is expected to lead to more testing  both routine and esoteric 
over the past year and a half  managed care providers have been shifting their approach to delivering health care by more frequently using diagnostic testing to improve outcomes and achieve greater economic benefit 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from managed care
