overview we integrate advanced microelectronics and molecular biology into a core technology platform with potentially broad and diverse commercial applications in the fields of genomics  biomedical research  medical diagnostics  drug discovery  forensics  agriculture  environmental testing and potentially the electronics and telecommunications industries 
the first application we have developed  the nanochip tm system  is an integrated bioassay system consisting of the nanochip tm molecular biology workstation and the nanochip tm cartridge 
the nanochip tm workstation is comprised of two automated instruments and the nanochip tm cartridge  a consumable cartridge  which incorporates a proprietary microchip 
the nanochip tm system provides a flexible tool for the rapid identification and precision analysis of biological test samples containing charged molecules 
since commencing operations in  we have applied substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have incurred losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant losses over at least the next several years as we expand our research and product development efforts and attempt to further commercialize our products 
we introduced our first two products into the marketplace in the second quarter of while we recognized revenue from product sales during the year ended december   our main sources of revenues during fiscal were payments under our sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants 
we believe our future operating results may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements  whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us or our competitors  market acceptance of the nanochip tm system and potential products under development  and the type of acquisition program our potential customers choose 
payments under contracts  grants and sponsored research agreements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount and therefore our results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  include  from the sale of our nanochip tm molecular biology workstations and nanochip tm cartridges 
during the year ended december   all revenue recorded related to sales of our nanochip tm molecular biology workstation resulted from outright sales transactions where title of the instrument passed to the customer 
we offer our products to customers under several different types of acquisition programs  some of which pass title of the instrument to the customer and some of which do not pass title to the customer 
our sales revenue may vary from year to year due to  among other things  the types of acquisition programs our potential customers may choose 
for the year ended december   revenue from sponsored research totaled million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues are primarily recorded under these arrangements as expenses are incurred 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
sponsored research revenue recognized during the year ended december  was earned in connection with our research and development agreements entered into in december and september with aventis  the joint venture agreement with becton dickinson as amended in september  and the development program entered into in july with hitachi  ltd 
sponsored research revenue recognized during the year ended december  was earned in connection with our research and development agreements with aventis  our joint venture collaboration with becton dickinson  and our nonexclusive research and development agreement with elan 
sponsored research revenue recognized during the year ended december  was earned in connection with our research and development agreement with aventis entered into in december  our joint venture collaboration with becton dickinson  and our nonexclusive research and development agreement with elan 
we are negotiating a potential new relationship with aventis relating to the research conducted and technology developed under the december agreement 
in september  we and becton dickinson modified the joint venture to  among other things  permit the partners the opportunity to commercialize certain of the partnership s technology and to allow them to collaborate with third parties in developing and commercializing certain products and technologies 
we do not expect to receive any additional funding from becton dickinson 
we and elan have not agreed upon specific program objectives with respect to the nonexclusive research and development program  and we do not expect to receive any additional funding from elan 
we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal and state agencies 
revenues are recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
continuation of sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants is dependent upon us achieving specific contractual milestones 
the recognition of revenue under sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
cost of sales for the year ended december   cost of sales were  cost of sales during the year ended december  were impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs due to underutilized capacity 
as we are still in the early stages of our first product launch  we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facility in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during these periods  research and development expenses included salaries for scientific  engineering and operations personnel  product design and prototype development costs  lab supplies  consulting  travel  facilities  and other expenditures associated with our research and product development activities 
the changes in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the different development stages of our nanochip tm molecular biology workstation from period to period 
during the years ended december  and  our nanochip tm molecular biology workstation was in an advanced stage of prototype design and development 
during this stage  we incurred significant expenditures both internally and with outside vendors related to engineering prototypes  as well as other costs associated with testing and refining the product 
in comparison  during the year ended december   many costs associated with the manufacturing of the workstation were absorbed by our manufacturing partner  hitachi  ltd 
research and development spending may increase over the next several years as our research and product development efforts continue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the year to year increases from through are primarily due to increased legal fees associated with enhancing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  costs related to patent litigation  increased personnel costs as we expanded our administrative  sales and marketing organizations  and the expansion of activities related to marketing and selling our products 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we continue to expand our sales and marketing organization and continue to enhance and maintain our intellectual property portfolio 
acquired in process technology during the first quarter of  we issued  shares of our series d convertible preferred stock at per share in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of nanotronics  inc this series d preferred stock converted into  shares of common stock at our initial public offering 
the in process technology acquired relates generally to nanotechnology and molecular electronics 
we recorded million in expenses relating to acquired in process technology during the year ended december  equity in loss of joint venture we recognized a loss of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  from the joint venture formed in with becton dickinson  based on the loss allocation described in the partnership agreement stating that losses will be allocated in proportion to and not to exceed required cash contributions 
there was no loss recognized during as no cash contributions were required to be made by us to the joint venture during that period 
in september  we and becton dickinson modified the joint venture to  among other things  permit the partners the opportunity to commercialize certain of the partnership s technology and to allow them to collaborate with third parties in developing and commercializing certain products and technologies 
we do not anticipate any additional funding to the joint venture 
interest income  net we had net interest income of million in compared to net interest income of million and million  in and  respectively 
the significant increase in compared to and can be primarily attributed to higher average cash balances in resulting from net proceeds received in conjunction with our secondary public offering of common stock in march the decrease in net interest income for compared to can be attributed to lower cash balances during compared to  as a result of cash used in operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the completion of our secondary public offering of common stock in march generating net proceeds of million  offset by net cash used in operations and for the acquisition of technology rights during the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used for operations during was primarily related to costs associated with entering the commercialization stage of our initial products including the procurement of inventory pursuant to our manufacturing arrangement with hitachi  ltd 
and expansion of our sales and marketing organization  support of our continuing research and development efforts  costs associated with legal fees relating to establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  and patent litigation 
cash used for operations during and was primarily related to the costs associated with developing prototypes of our initial product  the support of our expanding operations  including higher personnel costs  and legal fees relating to establishing and maintaining our intellectual property rights 
during the year ended december   we paid million to acquire rights to technologies in order to enable us to further develop and commercialize our products 
in addition  million of cash was used to invest in short term securities in an effort to maximize our return while preserving our cash balance 
we fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements through capital leasing facilities 
during  we received proceeds from equipment and leasehold improvement financing of  compared to  and million of proceeds received during and  respectively 
the significantly higher amount of proceeds received during is due to the expansion of our facility during that year 
we anticipate that we will continue to use capital equipment leasing or debt facilities to fund most of our equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we had million of available funding under our equipment lease lines 
we expect that our existing capital resources  combined with anticipated revenues from potential product sales  reagent rentals  leases or other types of acquisition programs for the nanochip tm system  sponsored research agreements  contracts and grants will be sufficient to support our planned operations through at least the next two years 
this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the extent to which our products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our potential products  the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  prosecution and enforcement of patents important to our business and any litigation related thereto  the results of clinical trials  competitive developments  and our ability to maintain existing collaborations and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flow to fund our operations for at least the next two years 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development programs  to scale up manufacturing activities and expand our sales and marketing efforts to support the commercialization of our products under development 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  or r d  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and california nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized  and the california tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and california r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless previously utilized 
we believe that our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may constitute a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
we also experienced a change of ownership in and as such  we may be limited in the amount of nols incurred prior to our initial public offering  which may be utilized to offset future taxable income 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations will have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols
