the majority of this decrease is due to a million decrease in sales of the chassis group 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase in sales by the evteam 
this segment recorded an increase of million over the prior year  due to the fire truck and ambulance markets not being affected by the fluctuations in the economy 
within the chassis group  the motorhome chassis line had sales decline over the fiscal year 
rising interest rates  coupled with higher crude oil prices and a fluctuating stock market  have contributed to the slower demand in the motorhome market 
in response to the softening market  the chassis group has developed a new chassis  the me  which is a mid engine chassis featuring a rear lift deck 
the rear lift deck  or traveling garage  provides extra storage space for bicycles  atvs  canoes and other toys that complement the rv lifestyle

gross margin dropped from in to in this is due to higher evteam sales and lower chassis group sales 
the evteam operates at lower margins than the chassis group since the value added is only in the body rather than the complete vehicle 
thus  the gross margin on the body is diluted by the pass through nature of the chassis cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from of sales for year ended december  to for the year ended december  this is due to a proactive move by the chassis group 
during the third quarter of  the chassis group reduced its salaried workforce by in order to combat operating expenses in light of lower sales levels 
the decrease in the company s income taxes is due to lower earnings before taxes in when compared to the effective tax rate for was  which is consistent with the effective tax rate of

discontinued operations on september   the company s board of directors passed a resolution to cease funding of the company s majority owned subsidiary  carpenter 
carpenter s board of directors then voted on september  to begin the orderly liquidation of carpenter 
since carpenter was a separate segment of the company s business  the disposition of carpenter s net assets is being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
during the fourth quarter of  carpenter completed the remaining items in its backlog and ceased production 
as part of its assignment for the benefit of creditors  carpenter is accepting offers for its land and building and will be disposing of many assets in an auction to be held at the end of march carpenter sales for the years ended december   and  which have been properly removed from the restated consolidated totals  were million  million and million  respectively

before the acquisitions  these chassis sales would have been considered revenues for the company 
within the chassis group  the product line that showed the most growth over the prior year is the motorhome chassis line 
sales of this product increased over the prior year 
the increase in motorhome chassis sales directly relates to the revenue and market share increases by the combined efforts of the company s two largest customers  fleetwood and newmar 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fire truck chassis sales for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  all significant fire truck chassis lines experienced growth over the prior year due to a stronger market 
transit bus chassis sales for decreased over  primarily due to the financial difficulties and subsequent bankruptcy filing of a primary bus customer of the company  metrotrans corp 
this bankruptcy also resulted in the company writing off inventory and accounts receivable totaling million during the fourth quarter of these write offs are the primary reason for the higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the write offs had less of an impact on gross margin as higher sales of the chassis group produced higher operating efficiencies that mitigated the effect 
for the year ended december   sales for school bus chassis and specialty chassis declined approximately and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in school bus chassis can be attributed to lower sales to the chassis group s primary customer  carpenter

see the consolidated statements of shareholders equity contained in this form k for further information regarding the changes in shareholders equity 
the company s primary line of credit is a million revolving note payable to a bank 
the company also has a million term note under the same debt agreement 
under the terms of the line of credit and term note agreement  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions

there were borrowings of  on this line at december  the million line carries an interest rate of above the bank s prime rate and expires only if there is a change in management 
there were no borrowings on this line at december  the company believes it has sufficient resources from cash flows from operating activities and  if necessary  from additional borrowings under its lines of credit to satisfy ongoing cash requirements for the next months 
effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s debt is tied to the prime and libor rates so that increases affecting interest rates may be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity
