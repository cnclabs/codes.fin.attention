item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in developing innovative pharmaceutical product candidates based on small molecule drugs and our proprietary gene regulation technology platforms 
we integrate functional genomics and proteomics  protein engineering  and structure based drug design in our drug discovery process 
our lead product candidates treatments for osteoporosis  cancer  anemia  and graft vs host disease  one of the major limitations of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation all work through small molecule regulation of cellular processes 
our benchmark gene regulation technologies  argent  rpd  and rge  already are being used by approximately academic investigators worldwide for scientific research 
commercial licenses to these technologies also are available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in their drug discovery efforts and for collaborative development of novel products 
aventis relationship from november through december  substantially all of our research revenue and the majority of our research expenses were incurred in collaboration with aventis pharmaceuticals inc  formerly known as hoechst marion roussel  inc  and its affiliates 
in november  we entered into an agreement with hoechst marion roussel  sa to collaborate on the discovery and development of drugs to treat osteoporosis and related bone diseases the osteoporosis agreement  one of our signal transduction inhibitor programs 
in march  we entered into an agreement  which established a joint venture  called the hoechst ariad genomics center  llc  or the genomics center  with aventis to pursue functional genomics with the goal of identifying genes that encode novel therapeutic proteins and small molecule drug targets 
we recognized aggregate revenue under these agreements of million in  million in and million in on december   we completed the sale of our interest in the genomics center to aventis  and as a result  we received million in cash   shares of our series b preferred stock were returned to us  aventis forgave million of long term debt we owed to them  we received drug candidates and related technologies resulting from the osteoporosis agreement  and we received the right to use certain genomics and bioinformatics technologies developed by the genomics center 
we recorded a net gain on the sale of million 
as a result of this sale  we did not receive any revenue from our relationship with aventis after  and we realized a reduction of revenue in fiscal of million from  which was more than offset by a reduction in research and development expenses of approximately million  primarily associated with the genomics center 
general since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we have received no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and substantially all revenue to date has been received in connection with our relationship with aventis 
except for the gain on the sale of the genomics center in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of our research and development programs  product manufacturing and clinical development 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents our business strategy balances potential near term revenues with longer term product development opportunities 
we plan to establish the commercial infrastructure to market certain of our current lead products for selected markets and or indications  pursue collaborative partnerships for other markets and or indications  license our platform technologies to selected biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for use in their genomics  proteomics and drug discovery programs and partner these technologies for joint development of novel products  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our strategies and generating future revenue streams 
as of january   we had no collaborative agreements that would generate revenue in results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized research revenue under our services agreements and collaborative research arrangements of  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million was due to the termination of our services agreements with the genomics center and the termination of the osteoporosis agreement as a result of the sale of our ownership interest in the genomics center 
as of january   we had no collaborative agreements that would generate revenue in interest income increased to million in from  in as a result of a higher level of invested funds 
operating expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the termination of services to the genomics center 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next year as a result of increased product development activities for our lead product candidates 
however  the amount of such increase in research and development spending will be determined  in part  by our ability to attract additional outside financing or to produce revenues through partnerships  licensing  joint ventures  or similar arrangements 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower professional and legal fees than those incurred in  which included fees from a proposed private placement offering during that was abandoned 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily due to a lower level of debt outstanding in as a result of repayments on our borrowings 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  a decrease in loss of million or 
we reported a loss of million in and reported income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million in after such cumulative effect  we reported net income of million for our results for included the gain on the sale of our interest in the genomics center of million 
although we earned taxable income in due to the gain on the sale of the genomics center  we were able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to eliminate substantially all taxes due 
we expect that operating losses will increase and be substantial for several more years as our product development activities expand  and these losses are expected to fluctuate as a result of differences in the timing and composition of revenue earned and expenses incurred 

table of contents on december  and january   we repurchased and retired all of our series c preferred stock and recorded a charge of million in representing the premium paid on the repurchase  which has been deducted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders

years ended december  and revenue we recognized research revenue under our services agreements  collaborative research arrangements and government sponsored grants of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  or in compared to was due to an increase of million in research revenue recognized in connection with our services agreements with the genomics center and the achievement of the second milestone of million under the osteoporosis agreement  partially offset by a reduction of million in the amortization of deferred revenue recognized in the prior year relating to the osteoporosis agreement and a decrease of  in government sponsored research grant revenue recognized in the prior year 
interest income decreased to  in from  in as a result of a lower level of invested funds and a realized loss on the sale of marketable securities of  recorded in operating expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased manufacturing development and other preclinical development costs from the levels that were incurred in  partially offset by increased research services provided to the genomics center under our services agreements in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased professional and legal services incurred in connection with litigation  as well as a proposed private placement that was not undertaken

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments primarily through the private placement and public offering of our securities  including the sale of series c preferred stock to investors and the sale of series b preferred stock to aventis pharmaceuticals inc  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt  operating and capital lease transactions  interest income  government sponsored research grants  research revenue under the osteoporosis agreement  research revenue under the terms of our services agreements with the genomics center  and  in december  the sale to aventis of our interest in the genomics center 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million compared to cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million at december  exclusive of million of cash  which was subsequently expended on january   to repurchase the remaining series c preferred stock 
the primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were million to finance our operations and working capital requirements  million to acquire marketable securities   to purchase laboratory equipment  million to repay long term debt and million to acquire intellectual property 

table of contents the primary sources of funds during the year ended december  were million from the exercise of our publicly traded warrants  million of new borrowings as a result of an extension and modification of our existing bank loan  million from the sale of common stock under the terms of an equity financing facility and a private placement of securities  and million from the sale of common stock from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the terms of the stock option and purchase plans 
prior to  we had issued  publicly traded warrants  each of which entitled its holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
during the year  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of  warrants 
of the remaining  warrants   warrants were redeemed at a cost of  and  expired on april  on june   we entered into an equity financing facility the equity facility with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
acqua wellington 
under the terms of the equity facility  at our option  we may from time to time sell up to an aggregate of million of our common stock to acqua wellington over an month period expiring in december  we agreed to issue and sell the shares to acqua wellington at a per share price equal to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during a specified period during which the shares are to be purchased  less a discount of between and  or under certain circumstances  less a discount mutually agreed to by the parties 
the discount is determined based on the threshold price we establish for the applicable period 
we have substantial fixed commitments under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these fixed commitments currently aggregate in excess of million per year and may increase 
we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether obtained through financial markets or collaborative or other arrangements with collaborative partners  or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
based on the historical spending levels to support our operations  our available funds will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operating requirements for the next two years 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans or other future events affecting our revenues or operating expenses will not result in the earlier depletion of our funds 
at december   we had available for federal tax reporting purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire commencing in we also had federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately million that expire commencing in the utilization of both the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits is subject to certain limitations under federal tax laws 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard  which must be adopted on january   requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of this standard on january  had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
sab was effective in the quarter ended december  and requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with 
table of contents accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
we have adopted this accounting standard as of december   which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
our marketable securities generally consist of corporate debt and us government securities primarily with maturities of one year or less  but generally less than six months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
these investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in the interest rates on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material due to the short term nature of these investments 
at december   we have a bank term note which bears interest at prime plus 
this note is sensitive to interest rate risk 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the prime rate basis points  we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year
