as of december   e loan had a warehouse line of credit for borrowings of up to million for the interim financing of mortgage loans 
the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is variable based on the commercial paper rate of the lender plus various percentage rates 
borrowings are collateralized by the mortgage loans held for sale 
the committed line of credit expires on june  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
this line of credit agreement generally requires e loan to comply with various financial and non financial covenants 
in particular  e loan must maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of million in addition to the requirement that e loan maintain at least one other warehouse facility of no less than million 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding at the time of termination 
e loan was in compliance with these covenants during the year ended and at december  e loan has an agreement to finance up to million of mortgage loan inventory pending sale of these loans to the ultimate mortgage loan investors 
of this amount  million is available in committed funds 
this loan inventory financing is secured by the related mortgage loans 
the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is based on libor plus various percentage points 
the line expires february  this agreement includes various financial and non financial covenants 
in particular  e loan must maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of the higher of million or the highest amount required by any other lender or agreement 
additionally  e loan is required to maintain at least one other warehouse facility of no less than million 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding at the time of termination 
e loan was not in compliance with certain of these covenants during the year ended december  and subsequently obtained a waiver from the lender 
e loan was in compliance with these covenants at december  on april   the company entered into an agreement for a million line of credit for the interim financing of auto loans 
the interest rate charged on this line is based on libor plus 
the committed line expires on april  this line includes various financial and non financial covenants 
these covenants are no more restrictive than those on the company s existing credit facilities 
on march   the company obtained million in interim financing through the issuance of promissory notes to two existing stockholders 
the borrowings have an interest rate of 
these borrowings are due and payable in full by april  in addition  on april   the company entered into a loan agreement with an officer and stockholder of the company that provides the company with the ability to draw funds up to an aggregate of million upon demand 
the borrowings have an interest rate of the lower of or the maximum legal rate allowed 
any amounts outstanding under this agreement are due and payable no earlier than january  e loan believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  of million and subsequent funds raised through april   will be sufficient to fund its operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the next months 
however  if during that period or thereafter e loan is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations  or in raising additional funds when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to e loan  these failures could have a material adverse effect on e loan s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of its then current stockholders would be reduced 
factors affecting future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have a history of losses  we expect losses to continue and we may not achieve or maintain profitability we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
because we expect our operating costs will increase to accommodate expected growth in loan applications  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history and consequently face significant risks and challenges in building our business we were incorporated in august  initiated our online mortgage operations in june and acquired our online auto operations in september we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate successfully if a downturn in the mortgage business occurs 
as a result of our limited operating history  our recent growth and our reporting responsibilities as a public company  we may need to expand operational  financial and administrative systems and control procedures to enable us to further train and manage our employees and coordinate the efforts of our underwriting  accounting  finance  marketing  and operations departments 
out quarterly financial results are vulnerable to significant fluctuations and seasonality  which could adversely affect our stock price our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
certain months or quarters have historically experienced a greater volume of purchase money mortgage and auto loan applications and funded loans 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business in several ways  including customers incentive to refinance existing mortgage loans a significant percentage of our mortgage customers use our services to refinance existing mortgages and they are motivated to do so primarily when interest rates fall below the rates of their existing mortgages 
in the event interest rates significantly increase  consumers incentive to refinance will be greatly reduced and the number of loans that we originate could significantly decline 
our ability to engage in profitable secondary sales of loans may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates the mortgage loan purchase commitments we obtain are contingent upon our delivery of the relevant loans to the purchasers within specified periods 
to the extent that we are unable to deliver the loans within the specified periods and interest rates increase during those periods  we may experience no gain or even a loss on the sale of these loans 
in addition  any increase in interest rates will increase the cost of maintaining our warehouse and repurchase lines of credit on which we depend to fund the loans we originate 
we have recently implemented a hedging program to manage the risk of loss due to fluctuations in interest rates  but our hedging efforts may not be successful  and no hedging strategy can completely eliminate interest rate risk 
a sharp decrease in interest rates over a short period may cause customers who have interest rates on mortgages committed through e loan to either delay closing their loans or refinance with another lender 
if this occurs in significant numbers  it may have an adverse effect on our business or quarterly results of operations 
our hedging strategy may not succeed in reducing our exposure to losses caused by fluctuations in interest rates we attempt to manage our interest rate risk exposure through hedging transactions using a combination of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and forward whole loan sales to fix the sales price of loans we expect to fund 
an effective hedging strategy is complex  and we have limited experience administering a hedging program 
a successful hedging program depends in part on our ability to properly estimate the number of loans that will actually close and is subject to fluctuations in the prices of mortgage backed securities  which do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of loans we originate and close 
to the extent that we implement a hedging strategy but are unable to effectively match our purchases and sales of mortgage backed securities with the sale of the closed loans we have originated  our gains on sales of mortgage loans will be reduced  or we will experience a net loss on those sales 
uncertainty with respect to the time it takes to close mortgage loans can lead to unpredictable revenue and profitability the time between the date an application for a mortgage loan is received from a customer on our website and the date the loan closes can be lengthy and unpredictable 
the loan application and approval process is often delayed due to factors over which we have little or no control  including the timing of the customer s decision to commit to an available interest rate  the close of escrow date for purchase loans  the timeliness of appraisals and the adequacy of the customer s own disclosure documentation 
purchase mortgage loans generally take longer to close than refinance loans as they are tied to the close of the property sale escrow date 
this uncertain timetable can have a direct impact on our revenue and profitability for any given period 
we may expend substantial funds and management resources supporting the loan completion process and never generate revenue from closed loans 
therefore  our results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if the mortgage loans applied for during that period do not close in a timely manner or at all 
we have recently experienced significant growth in our business  and if we are unable to manage this growth  our business will be adversely affected over the past two years we have experienced significant growth  which has placed a strain on our resources and will continue to do so in the future 
our failure to manage this growth effectively could adversely affect our business 
we may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or maintaining adequate management  financial and operating systems and controls 
our headcount has grown substantially 
at december   we had full time employees  at december   we had full time employees  and at december  we had full time employees 
if online lending and our service offerings do not achieve widespread consumer acceptance  our business will be adversely affected our success will depend in large part on widespread consumer acceptance of obtaining mortgage and auto loans online 
the development of an online market for mortgage and auto loans has only recently begun  is rapidly evolving and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
our future growth  if any  will depend on the following critical factors o the growth of the internet as a commerce medium generally  and as a market for consumer financial products and services  specifically  o our ability to successfully and cost effectively market our services to a sufficiently large number of customers  and o our ability to overcome a perception among many real estate market participants that obtaining mortgages online is risky for consumers 
we cannot assure you that the market for our services will develop  that our services will be adopted or that consumers will significantly increase their use of the internet for obtaining mortgage or auto loans 
if the online market for mortgage and auto loans fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  or if our services do not achieve widespread market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the loss of one or more of our significant distribution partners would adversely affect our business we rely on internet distribution partners to direct a significant number of prospective customers to our website 
if we lose any of our significant distribution partners  we will likely fail to meet our growth objectives  both in terms of additional borrowers and increased brand awareness 
in the aggregate  approximately and of our mortgage and auto loan applications  respectively  were derived from the websites of our distribution partners during the year ended december  our agreements with our distribution partners are typically short term  from one to four years in length  and most can be terminated for any reason upon to days prior written notice 
we cannot assure you that any or all of these agreements will not be terminated or will be renewed or extended past their current expiration dates 
if any of these agreements were to be terminated or were to lapse without extension  we could lose a considerable number of loan applications and our business would be adversely affected 
the termination of one or more of our mortgage funding sources would adversely affect our business we depend on ge capital mortgage services  inc ge capital to finance our self funded mortgage loan activities through the warehouse credit facility they provide 
we also depend on greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich capital to finance portions of our mortgage loan inventory pending ultimate sale to mortgage loan purchasers 
if either of these warehouse credit facilities becomes unavailable  our business would be adversely affected 
under our agreements with each of these lenders  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants on either or both lines could result in the termination of our agreements and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past  we have had to obtain waivers from greenwich capital and ge capital as a result of our failure to comply with covenants regarding the issuance of capital stock  excess asset purchases and the breach of financial ratios 
our agreement with greenwich capital expires in february and our agreement with ge capital expires in june upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing lines or obtain sufficient additional lines 
the termination of our auto line of credit would adversely affect our business we have obtained a line of credit from bank one  na  to finance the funding of our auto loans  and it is our sole facility for auto loan fundings 
if this credit facility becomes unavailable  our business would be adversely affected 
under our line of credit agreement  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants could result in the termination of the facility and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past  with respect to our mortgage warehouse lines  we have had to obtain waivers from greenwich capital and ge capital as a result of our failure to comply with covenants regarding the issuance of capital stock  excess asset purchases and the breach of financial ratios 
our line of credit with bank one  na expires april  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing lines or obtain sufficient additional lines 
we are dependent on primarily one lending source for all of our home equity business currently  the majority of our home equity loans are funded through wells fargo bank pursuant to a home equity loan line purchase agreement 
we currently rely on wells fargo bank s underwriting system for the processing of the majority of our home equity loans 
if wells fargo bank is unable to underwrite or fund our home equity loans  we may experience delays in processing loans or an inability to accept or process home equity loan applications until we are able to secure new sources of funding 
sufficient additional sources of funding for our home equity loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we do not increase the number of auto loan lenders who fund through our site our auto loan business will not grow to grow our auto loan business  we must broaden our offering of auto loans to a wide range of credit profiles 
in order to fund auto loans to applicants throughout the credit spectrum  we must increase the number of lenders who make their loan products available through our site 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into arrangements with sufficient other auto loan lenders on favorable terms or at all 
we depend on the timely and competent services of various companies involved in the mortgage process  if these companies fail to timely and competently deliver these services  our business and reputation will be directly and adversely affected we rely on other companies to perform services related to the loan underwriting process  including appraisals  credit reporting and title searches 
any interruptions or delays in the provision of these services may cause delays in the processing and closing of loans for our customers 
if we are unsuccessful in managing the timely delivery of these services we will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction and our business and reputation could be adversely affected 
the loss of our relationship with any of our significant providers of automated underwriting would have an adverse effect on our business we depend on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae and freddie mac agencies  to help ensure that our mortgage services can be offered efficiently and on a timely basis 
we currently have an agreement with the agencies that authorizes our use of their automated underwriting services and enables us to sell qualified first mortgages to these agencies 
we cannot assure you that we will remain in good standing with the agencies or that the agencies will not terminate our relationship 
we expect to continue to process a significant portion of our conforming mortgage loans using the agencies systems until we are able to obtain automated underwriting services from other providers 
our agreement with the agencies can be terminated by either party 
we utilize an automated underwriting system provided by zoot for our home equity loan business 
the termination of our agreements with the agencies or zoot would adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to streamline the mortgage origination process 
we may incur losses on loans if we breach representations or warranties to mortgage loan purchasers in connection with the sale of mortgage and auto loans  we make customary representations and warranties to loan purchasers relating to  among other things  compliance with laws and origination practices 
in the event we breach any of these representations and warranties  we may be required to repurchase or substitute these loans and bear any subsequent losses on the repurchased loans 
we may also be required to indemnify mortgage and auto loan purchasers for these losses and claims with respect to loans for which there was a breach of representations and warranties 
in addition  many of our agreements with mortgage and auto loan purchasers prohibit our solicitation of borrowers with respect to the refinancing of loans we originate and sell 
the loan purchasers under our mortgage loan purchase agreements may construe our continuing mortgage monitoring service as violating these non solicitation provisions  in which case they may elect to terminate their agreements with us or may seek recovery from us for damages sustained by them 
many of our agreements with mortgage and auto loan purchasers prohibit us from refinancing mortgage and auto loans for specified time periods  unless we pay penalties to the loan purchasers or obtain their consent 
many of these agreements also require us to return any premiums paid by a mortgage or auto loan purchaser if the loans purchased are prepaid in full during periods of up to months following the date the loan is purchased 
the consumer lending industry is intensely competitive  and if we fail to successfully compete in this industry  our market share and business will be adversely affected to compete successfully  we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change  evolving standards and our competitors innovations by continuing to enhance and expand our services  as well as our sales and marketing channels 
increased competition  particularly online competition  could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully in our market environment and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to comply with the numerous laws and regulations that govern our industry  our business could be adversely affected our business must comply with all applicable state and federal laws  and with extensive and complex rules and regulations of  and licensing and examination by  various federal  state and local government authorities 
these rules impose obligations and restrictions on our mortgage and auto loan brokering and lending activities 
in particular  these rules limit the broker fees  interest rates  finance charges and other fees we may assess  require extensive disclosure to our customers  prohibit discrimination and impose on us multiple qualification and licensing obligations 
we may not always have been and may not always be in compliance with these requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  revocation of required licenses or registrations  loss of approved status  voiding of loan contracts or security interests  indemnification liability or the obligation to repurchase loans sold to loan purchasers  rescission of mortgage loans  class action lawsuits  administrative enforcement actions and civil and criminal liability 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate and could disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results in september  we acquired electronic vehicle remarketing  inc  and we may acquire or make investments in other complementary businesses  technologies  services or products in the future 
these acquisitions and investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
in the past  we have had discussions with companies regarding our acquiring  or investing in  their businesses  products  services  or technologies  and we expect to have additional discussions in the future 
if we acquire a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology  and software 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we could also have difficulty in integrating the acquired products  services or technologies into our operations  and we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
the loss of any of our executive officers or key personnel would likely have an adverse effect on our business our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly co founders chris larsen  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  as well as joseph kennedy  president and chief operating officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
larsen and mr 
kennedy or other key employees  would also likely have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our executives  except mr 
kennedy  and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed competition for personnel throughout our industry is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
our future success depends on our continuing to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly with respect to our loan processing functions 
we have in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  our business will be adversely affected 
our business will be impaired if consumers do not continue to use the internet our business will be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly by home and auto buyers 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage by consumers  including inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  many websites have experienced service interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet infrastructure 
if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future  internet usage  as well as the usage of our website  could grow more slowly or decline 
our business will suffer if we are unable to expand and promote our brand recognition establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to attracting and expanding our customer base  solidifying our business relationships and successfully implementing our business strategy 
we cannot ensure that our brand will be positively accepted by the market or that our reputation will be strong 
promotion and enhancement of our brand will also depend  in part  on our success in providing a high quality customer experience 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in achieving this goal 
to date  we have received customer complaints regarding the quality of our service 
if these complaints persist  they may significantly damage our reputation and offset the efforts we make in promoting and enhancing our brand and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if visitors to our website do not perceive our existing services to be of high quality or if we alter or modify our brand image  introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received  the value of our brand could be diluted  thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our service to potential customers 
our business will suffer if we are unable to adopt to the rapid technological change that characterizes our industry our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our services 
we rely on third party software products and services  including software related to automated underwriting functions  which will enable us to realize processing efficiencies that are central to our operations 
if we are unable to integrate this software in a fully functional manner  we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
in addition  enhancements of our products and services must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
any outages  delays or other difficulties experienced by the internet service providers  online service providers or other website operators on which our users depend could adversely affect our business our website has in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to our websites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
additionally  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
any of these problems could adversely affect our business 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers financial data internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches that occur 
we also retain on our premises personal financial documents that we receive from prospective borrowers in connection with their loan applications 
these documents are highly sensitive and if a third party were to misappropriate our customers personal information  customers could possibly bring legal claims against us 
we cannot assure you that our privacy policy will be deemed sufficient by our prospective customers or any federal or state laws governing privacy  which may be adopted in the future 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party challenges or if we are involved in litigation trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
although we seek to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights through a variety of means  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken are adequate to protect these rights 
we may also license content from third parties in the future  and it is possible that we could face infringement actions based upon the content licensed from these third parties 
trademark or propriety rights claims against us  regardless of their merit  could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and technical and management personnel 
further  if any of these claims are proved valid  through litigation or otherwise  we may be required to change our trademarks and pay financial damages  which could adversely affect our business 
competition the market for the origination of consumer loans is rapidly evolving  both online and through traditional channels  and competition for borrowers is intense and is expected to increase significantly in the future 
e loan faces competition from offline mortgage brokers and auto dealers  who as a group provide the majority of mortgage loans  helocs  and auto loans  respectively 
in addition  e loan competes directly with companies offering mortgage and auto loans over the internet 
principal among these competitors are intuit quickenloans  lendingtree  and peoplefirst 
traditional lenders  including countrywide  norwest  wells fargo and bank of america  also provide access to their loan offerings over the internet 
increased competition  particularly online competition  could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business 
further  we cannot assure you that e loan s competitors and potential competitors will not develop services and products that are equal or superior to those of e loan or that achieve greater market acceptance than its products and services 
e loan believes that the primary competitive factors in creating a financial services resource on the internet are functionality  brand recognition  customer loyalty  ease of use  quality of service  reliability and critical mass 
competition is likely to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their services 
many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including o longer operating histories  o greater name recognition  o larger  established customer bases  and o substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
intellectual property trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
although we seek to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights through a variety of means  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken are adequate to protect these rights 
we may also license content from third parties in the future and it is possible that we could face infringement actions based upon the content licensed from these third parties 
claims brought against us  regardless of their merit  could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and technical and management personnel 
further  if any of these claims are proved valid  through litigation or otherwise  we may be required to change our trademarks and pay financial damages  which could adversely affect our business 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate movements significantly impact e loan s volume of closed loans and represent the primary component of market risk to e loan 
in a higher interest rate environment  consumer demand for mortgage loans  particularly refinancing of existing mortgages  declines 
interest rate movements affect the interest income earned on loans held for sale  interest expense on the warehouse lines payable  the value of mortgage loans held for sale and ultimately the gain on sale of mortgage loans 
e loan attempts to minimize the interest rate risk associated with the time lag between when loans are rate locked and when they are committed for sale or exchanged in the secondary market  through its hedging activities 
individual mortgage loan risks are aggregated by note rate  mortgage loan type and stage in the pipeline  and are then matched  based on duration  with the appropriate hedging instrument  thus mitigating basis risk until closing and delivery 
e loan currently hedges its mortgage pipeline through mandatory forward sales of fannie mae mortgage backed securities and non mandatory forward sale agreements with the ultimate investor 
e loan determines which alternative provides the best execution in the secondary market 
e loan believes that it has implemented a cost effective hedging program to provide a level of protection against changes in the market value of its fixed rate mortgage loans held for sale 
however  an effective strategy is complex and no hedging strategy can completely insulate the company against such changes
