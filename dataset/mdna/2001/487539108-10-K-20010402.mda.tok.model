item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of tkci and its subsidiaries and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of any number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and under other captions contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we derive most of our revenue from professional service activities 
the majority of these activities are billed under various types of contracts with our clients  including fixed price and time and materials contracts 
most of our time and material contracts have not to exceed provisions 
revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the proportion of actual direct contract costs incurred to total estimated direct contract costs 
we believe that costs incurred are the best available measure of progress towards completion on these contracts 
in the course of providing services  we sometimes subcontract for various services 
these costs are included in billings to clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in our gross revenue 
because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
accordingly  we also report net revenue  which is gross revenue less reimbursable subcontractor costs 
our revenue is generated from a large number of relatively small contracts 
costs of revenue include labor  non reimbursable subcontractor costs  materials and various direct and indirect overhead costs including rent  utilities and depreciation 
direct labor employees work predominantly at our offices and at the clients job sites 
the number of direct labor employees assigned to a contract will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
contract terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when direct labor employees are not fully utilized 
as we continue to grow  we anticipate that we will continue to add professional and administrative staff to support our growth 
these professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
the significant competition for employees with the skills we require creates wage pressures on professional compensation 
we attempt to increase our billing rates to customers to compensate for wage increases  however  there can be a lag before wage increases can be incorporated into our existing contracts 
some expenses  primarily long term leases  are fixed and cannot be adjusted in reaction to an economic downturn 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate costs related to finance and accounting  information technology  business development and marketing  contract proposal  executive salaries  provisions for doubtful accounts  amortization of goodwill and other indirect overhead costs 
on august   we were reorganized so that keith engineering  an entity under common control with tkci  became a wholly owned subsidiary of tkci 
in august  we purchased john m 
tettemer associates  ltd  or jmta  which provides services relating to flood control and drainage engineering  environmental permitting  and biological surveys and studies 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of thompson hysell  inc  or thompson hysell 
further  in july  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  in october  we acquired crosby  mead  benton associates which provides engineering and design services for master planned communities in southern california 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of hook associates engineering  inc  an engineering and consulting services firm with offices located in phoenix  arizona  denver  colorado and cheyenne  wyoming  providing a full range of services to clients in an array of industries including real estate development  public works infrastructure and communications

net revenue growth for compared to resulted primarily from our acquisitions of thompson hysell in july and crosby  mead  benton associates in october  which contributed million to net revenue for  compared to million in  growth in our surveying and mapping services  resulting primarily from the strong demand for housing in california and nevada  and from growth in our industrial energy segment  partially as a result of the need to design and construct backup and new power generation systems needed by individual power users and power providers 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  declined slightly to for compared to for  resulting largely from a reduction in subcontractor services for several large contracts in our real estate development  public works infrastructure and communications segment 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit increased to for compared to for the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage for compared to  resulted primarily from higher net revenue and profit margins generated through our acquisition of thompson hysell  improved profit margins in our industrial energy segment  improved utilization of our professionals and an increased focus on contracts with higher profit margins 
these gross profit increases were partially offset by an increase in the employer matching contribution of our k plan in in addition  gross profit margins in were negatively impacted by operating results on two large projects  resulting in a less favorable comparison with the gross profit margin which was not similarly impacted 
costs of revenue for was million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
costs of revenue increases resulted primarily from increased expenses associated with the growth in our total employee base from in to in  an increase of  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from our acquisitions of thompson hysell in july and crosby  mead  benton associates in october  including the amortization of goodwill  employee recruiting costs  and a full year of other costs associated with operating as a public company 
the percentage decrease was due principally to economies of scale associated with our acquisitions  which has resulted in lower administrative costs in comparison to revenue generated 
interest expense 
interest expense for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  interest expense was for compared to for the percentage decrease resulted largely from the repayment of our previous line of credit and various related party notes payable with a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering in july and the repayment of certain capital leases in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase in income tax expense was due primarily to a higher taxable income base  mitigated by a lower effective income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for compared to for years ended december  and december  revenue 
net revenue for was million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
net revenue increased by million as a result of the acquisitions of jmta in august and thompson hysell in july excluding the revenue from acquisitions  our net revenue grew million  or  compared to  resulting primarily from the continued overall strengthening of the california economy 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  declined to for compared to for  resulting largely from a decrease of million relating to our primary telecommunications contract which came to substantial completion in gross profit 
gross profit for was million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
gross profit growth is attributable to both our internal revenue increases as well as the acquisitions of jmta and thompson hysell 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased slightly to for compared to for the decline in the gross profit percentage is attributable primarily to an increase in the estimated direct contract costs expected to be incurred on two large projects resulting in a reduction to the estimated percentage of completion on these contracts and consequently a  reduction in gross profit 
excluding this impact  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was for the gross profit percentage was further reduced by a decline in the profitability in the industrial  process and manufacturing operations of esi and our increase in the employer matching contribution of our k plan in  resulting from the continued need to attract and retain quality professionals

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of internally generated funds  bank borrowings  leases and the sale of our common stock 
cash and cash equivalents as of december   were million compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december   an increase of  or  resulting primarily from the growth in contracts and trade receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  primarily due to our acquisition of crosby  mead  benton associates and higher revenue levels 
this was offset by an increase in the current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations as a note payable with a principal balance of million as of december  was reclassified from long term to short term based on its maturity date 
in addition  our line of credit was reclassified to current based on its september maturity date 
the debt to equity ratio as of december  was to compared to to as of december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was a result of an increase in contracts and trade receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and the reduction of trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities  primarily due to the paydown of employee accrued vacation and sick time accumulated in prior years 
these decreases were partially offset by higher income before the effects of depreciation and amortization 
the cash generated from operating activities was used primarily to make principal payments on long term and short term debt and capital leases  to pay off certain capital leases  to fund capital expenditures  and to partially fund our acquisition of crosby  mead  benton associates in october capital expenditures for were million compared to million in the capital expenditures consisted primarily of computer equipment and upgrades to our information systems 
we expect to maintain capital expenditures in fiscal at approximately the level  before consideration for future acquisitions  to support technology investments 
in september  we entered into a new line of credit agreement with a bank  which allows us to borrow up to an aggregate of million 
the line of credit consists of a working capital component with a maximum outstanding principal balance of million  maturing on september   and an equipment component with a maximum outstanding principal balance of million  which matured on september  on september  and november   the line of credit was amended to extend the maturity of the equipment component to january  the equipment component ultimately matured on january  and we elected not to amend or extend this component 
we plan on reestablishing the equipment component when we renew the working capital component as a result of negotiations with the bank in the working capital component bears interest at either the prime rate or at approximately above libor and the equipment component bore interest at either the prime rate or at approximately above libor 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under the working capital component of the line of credit was million bearing interest at 
the borrowings on the line of credit agreement were used primarily to fund our acquisition of crosby  mead  benton associates and for other working capital needs 
net proceeds of  from our initial public offering in july were used primarily to repay related party notes payable and accrued interest  to repay notes payable  to repay our previous bank line of credit and to acquire thompson hysell 
in  our primary expected sources of liquidity are existing cash balances  cash generated by operations and availability under our credit facility 
our primary cash requirements are expected to include capital expenditures estimated to be approximately million and scheduled reductions of principal on outstanding indebtedness of approximately million 
assuming our credit facility is renewed at maturity in september  or we are able to arrange for a replacement credit facility with a similar availability  we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our anticipated operations and planned capital expenditures and debt reductions for the next months 
inflation although our operations can be influenced by general economic trends  we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
due to the short term nature of most of our contracts  if costs of revenue increase  we attempt to pass these increases to our clients 
impact of issued but not yet adopted accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  describes the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for the first fiscal quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we do not believe that the implementation of sfas no 
 as amended  will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt  which are used to maintain liquidity and to fund capital expenditures and our expansion 
due to the relatively immaterial levels of our current borrowings  our earnings and cash flows are not materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
promissory notes delivered in connection with our acquisitions have generally been at fixed rates 
our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the table below presents the principal amounts of debt excluding capital lease obligations of  and a note payable of  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other items required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes as of december  dollars are expressed in thousands 
fair total value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt    average interest rate the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt was determined based on current rates offered for debt instruments with similar risks and maturities 
fixed rate debt excludes a note payable with a carrying amount of  due to the nature of this financing 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented in the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on those exposures or positions that arise during the period and interest rates
