forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in general  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that such forward looking statements are intended to provide management s current expectations for the future operating and financial performance of the company based on assumptions believed to be valid at the time 
thus  such expectations are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements 
in addition to general economic conditions and market trends  some of the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include  but are not limited to  the following a major downturn of the us or european automotive markets 
although lydall s automotive sales are not solely contingent on the strength of the automotive market  a significant downturn of the us or european automotive industries could have a substantial impact on lydall s results 
the company can also be affected when automotive manufacturers discontinue production of specific models that contain lydall s products 
on the other hand  lydall benefits from the introduction of new models that contain the company s products 
approximately percent of lydall s total sales in were to the automotive market 
lydall s automotive products are thermal and acoustical barriers and heat shields employed both inside and under the body of vehicles 
most of lydall s products are supplied to meet unique  niche applications 
lydall may have a number of components on a particular vehicle 
also  applications range across all types of vehicles from sport utility models to trucks and vans to cars 
thus  there is no direct correlation between the number of lydall products sold and the number of vehicles being built by automotive manufacturers 
slight fluctuations in automotive production have relatively little effect on lydall s business  however  a major downward shift could prevent lydall from achieving its projected results 
raw material pricing and supply 
raw material pricing and supply issues affect all of lydall s businesses and can influence results in the short term 
the thermal acoustical segment uses aluminum in the manufacturing of most automotive heat shields 
the heat shields are sold under long term agreements with established fixed sales prices 
volatility in aluminum prices over the agreement periods could impact thermal acoustical segment profitability 
new product introductions 
improved performance and growth is partially linked to new product introductions planned for the future 
the timing and degree of success of new product programs could impact lydall s projected results
