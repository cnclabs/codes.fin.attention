business business risks and qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports  including this annual report on form k for they year ended december  we are a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems  which accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics and combinatorial chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
molecular devices instruments systems are based on our advanced core technologies that integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology  and chemistry 
we enable our customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
molecular devices acquired all of the outstanding stock of ljl biosystems in a tax free  stock for stock transaction on august   as a result of which ljl biosystems became a wholly owned subsidiary of molecular devices 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  accordingly  all financial information has been restated to include the operations of ljl biosystems for all periods presented 
our combined operations have typically invested to of our revenues in research and development  which has resulted in a track record of technological innovation 
over of our revenues in were derived from products that we introduced in the last three years 
we have sold over  instruments in our history 
our customers include small and large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and industrial companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in we recognize revenue on the sale of our products at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
total service revenue was less than of total revenues for all periods presented 
in  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of total revenues and total sales denominated in foreign currencies accounted for of total revenues 
we typically experience a decrease in the level of sales in the first calendar quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year because of budgetary and capital equipment purchasing patterns in the life sciences industry 
we expect this trend to continue in future years

years ended december   and revenues for increased by to million from million in revenues for increased by to million from million in this top line growth was driven by strong contributions from both our life sciences research and drug discovery product families in each year 
life sciences research revenues increased in primarily due to the worldwide strength of the spectramax plus and spectramax gemini xs  both introduced in the first quarter of  and increased threshold revenues worldwide 
in  the life sciences research revenues increased primarily due to the worldwide strength of the spectramax gemini 
drug discovery growth was driven primarily by the continued worldwide demand for our flipr as well as increased sales of ljl biosystems analyst ad and analyst ht 
gross margin decreased slightly to in from in gross margin increased to in from in the to increase related to increased sales of higher margin products in both the life sciences research and drug discovery product families  primarily the spectramax gemini and flipr and ljl biosystems analyst ht

research and development expenses for increased to million from million in  an increase of 
the increased spending for both periods is primarily the result of additional personnel as well as increased expenditures on development activities required to support both the introduction and on going development of new life sciences research and drug discovery products  including new reagent kits optimized for use on our detection systems 
we recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of related to the merger with ljl biosystems  including transition costs  investment banking  legal and other advisory services 
we recorded a charge of million during the second quarter of due to the write off of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of skatron

we recorded income tax provisions of million in  million in and million in these provisions reflected a  and effective tax rate in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for is calculated on profit before tax excluding the ljl biosystems merger expenses  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
the lower rates in and are primarily due to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards of ljl biosystems in those years 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared to million at december  prior to the merger with ljl biosystems  we had typically financed our operations primarily from cash flows provided by operating activities 
however  due to the million merger charge in the third quarter of and ljl biosystems operating losses  million  million and million was used in operating activities during  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the substantial increase in was primarily due to million of net short term investment purchases  million invested in other assets  primarily a million investment in argonex  inc and a million strategic equity investment in a privately held company and million of capital expenditures  primarily related to our facilities expansion in sunnyvale  california 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the maturity of short term investments  offset by million of cash used for the acquisition of skatron 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the proceeds were primarily generated by molecular devices public offering in the second quarter of  the ljl biosystems private placement in the first quarter of  as well as cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the year 
the and proceeds relate primarily to the private placement by ljl biosystems in and ljl biosystems initial public offering in  as well as stock option exercises in each of those years 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research programs  market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow to fund our capital requirements primarily through financing activities over the last three years 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards sfas no

sfas no

changes in the fair value of derivatives will be reported currently in earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on their effectiveness pursuant to sfas no 
as of december   we had not engaged in hedging activities 
however  we anticipate engaging in hedging activity in the future  and therefore  expect to be impacted by the pronouncement at such time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial institutions is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities  consisting of million of commercial paper and million of us government agency securities  are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within to days  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  germany and canada  where we sell direct in local currencies 
all other export sales  with the exception of sales into canada  are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in canada have historically been immaterial 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and norway are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
those gains and losses have historically been immaterial
