general through three wholly owned subsidiaries  we currently operate schools in states offering a range of graduate  undergraduate and non degree certificate or diploma programs primarily in the fields of information technology  healthcare and business to more than  students 
we are organized into a university degree division and an associate degree division 
the university degree division offers primarily doctorate  master and bachelor degrees through colorado tech 
the associate degree division offers associate degrees and diplomas or certificates through sanford brown and uds 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees paid by students 
the majority of students rely on funds received from title iv programs to pay for a substantial portion of their tuition 
accordingly  a majority of our revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs 
instructional and educational support expenses consist primarily of costs related to the educational activity of our schools 
instructional and educational support expenses include salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel 
instructional and educational support expenses also include occupancy costs  costs of books sold  and depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements 
selling and promotional expenses consist primarily of advertising costs  production costs of marketing materials  and salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in student recruitment  admissions  and promotional functions

excluding huron university  the university degree division experienced a increase in average student enrollment 
average student enrollment in the associate degree division remained relatively unchanged 
the increase in student enrollment in the university degree division was primarily due to increased enrollment at colorado tech s sioux falls campus and in colorado tech s information technology programs

the decrease in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense 
bad debt expense was negatively impacted by the october required adoption of the department of education s new methodology for calculating the amount of previously disbursed federal student financial aid that we must return to the federal government with respect to students who have since withdrawn from our schools 
this new regulation results in an increase in the student s obligation to the school from which they have withdrawn that will not be paid by federal student financial aid funds 
we reported income from operations of million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended march  excluding huron university  income from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease in profitability was primarily due to a decrease in income from operations of million in the university degree division due to an increase in expenses related to the start up of colorado tech s online program

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations divestiture of huron university 
we reported net losses of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in net loss was primarily due to the loss of million  after taxes realized in fiscal in connection with the sale of our minority ownership of huron university and the implementation of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
effective april   which resulted in a one time charge after taxes of million 
these losses were partially offset by operating losses of million sustained at huron university in fiscal prior to the divestiture of this campus in august year ended march  compared to year ended march  net revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  which was sold in august  net revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average student enrollment

selling and promotional expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses increased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  excluding huron university  selling and promotional expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses increased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  this increase in selling and promotional expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses in the associate degree division resulting from our marketing efforts directed at increasing enrollment 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses remained constant at for the years ended march  and march  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in administrative payroll expenses in the associate degree division to support the growth in student enrollment 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses in the university degree division due to a reduction in administrative payroll expenses due to the consolidation of certain administrative functions with the corporate office 
legal settlement costs of million were incurred in fiscal in connection with the settlement of the lawsuit filed against uds 
we reported a loss from operations of  for the year ended march  as compared to operating income of million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  income from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  we reported a net loss of million and net income of million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in pre tax profits of million in the associate degree division  which was partially offset by an increase in pre tax profits of million in the university degree division 
the decrease in profitability in the associate degree division was primarily due to an increase in instructional and educational support expenses to support the anticipated increase in student enrollment and the offering of a new program  an increase in selling and promotional expenses  and legal settlement costs of million incurred in fiscal due to a shortfall in anticipated new student enrollments for the year ended march   the revenues generated in the associate degree division did not offset the increase in operating expenses 
the increase in profitability in the university degree division was due to an increase of million in operating profits at the three colorado tech campuses  net of related general and administrative expenses  resulting from increased enrollment with the primary increase at the sioux falls campus 
also  operating losses sustained at huron university decreased by million due to the divestiture of this campus in august huron university sustained operating losses of million and million for the years ended march  and march   respectively 
divestiture of huron university in  we sold the huron  south dakota  campus of huron university to a group of investors  including members of the campus management team 
in connection with the transaction  we contributed the operating assets of the school  certain of its liabilities and  in cash to the purchaser and agreed to guarantee a portion of the assumed liabilities 
we also retained a minority interest in the school 
we extended a loan of  to the campus president to assist him in funding the transaction 
the terms of the transaction were established through an arm s length negotiation  and we recorded no gain or loss 
we recorded our minority investment in the school at a cost of approximately million  which then approximated fair value 
we recorded the investment under the cost method due to our inability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the purchaser 
on april   the investor group sold the school to a not for profit college 
this transaction released us from any further obligations associated with the school  including our guarantee 
we did not receive any proceeds from this transaction  and recorded a one time non recurring non cash charge of approximately million or per diluted share  in the fiscal quarter ended march  relating to our minority ownership of the school 
our loan of  to the campus president remained outstanding after the sale 
the loan is due in august with monthly interest payments at the prime rate which commenced in october the loan is secured by  shares of our common stock owned by the campus president 
the not for profit college that purchased the school has also agreed to guarantee this loan 
seasonality we experience seasonality in our quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in our schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our working capital totaled million at march   million at march  and million at march  net cash of million was provided by operating activities in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal and million from fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in net profits of million 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal and  from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to our investment of million in huron university in fiscal which was partially offset by an increase of million in cash used for capital expenditures 
we estimate that the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during fiscal will approximate million 
these anticipated capital expenditures primarily relate to the costs associated with the acquisition and upgrade of equipment for the schools and the relocation and upgrade of campus facilities 
funds required to finance such capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from additional capital lease obligations and from funds generated from operations 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in fiscal  a decrease in cash used of million from fiscal year and million from fiscal the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal was due to a decrease in the repayment of debt 
in march  our million credit facility was restructured into a million line of credit and a million capital expenditure term note 
the million line of credit is scheduled to mature on june  at march   we had million outstanding under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding of million which reduced the amount available for borrowing 
the amounts borrowed under this facility in fiscal were primarily used for operations 
the million term note is payable in monthly installments through april the amounts borrowed under this facility were used for capital expenditures in the current and prior years 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
we anticipate that the repurchase of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  since the inception of the repurchase program  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  our primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending our schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
we believe that given our working capital  our cash flow from operations  our line of credit and our expected increased financings under capital lease obligations to fund capital expenditures  we will have adequate resources to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements effective april   we implemented sab and changed the method by which we recognize revenue for laboratory and registration fees charged to a student 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenue for these fees ratably over the life of an education program 
previously  we recognized laboratory and registration fees as revenue at the beginning of our academic term or year  as applicable 
we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting of approximately  net of taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk related to our variable rate line of credit and capital expenditure term note as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   our variable rate long term debt had a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value because the variable rates approximate market rates 
a increase in the period end interest rate would not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition
