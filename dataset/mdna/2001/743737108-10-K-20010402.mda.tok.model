overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications signals  and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation and amortization  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management were to take specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international  national and regional economic conditions 
third  the volume of capitalized track or recollectable projects performed by the company s maintenance of way and communications signals departments can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses 
the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses  and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year 
one of the company s customers  tilcon connecticut  inc  which ships construction aggregate from three separate quarries on the company s system to asphalt production plants in connecticut and new york  accounted for approximately   and of its operating revenues in   and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to offset the decrease in operating revenues

the increase in conventional freight revenues results from an increase in the average revenue received per conventional carloading of partially offset by a small decrease in traffic volume 
the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased by  or  to  in from  in the decrease in conventional carloadings results primarily from a net decrease in carloadings for existing customers partially offset by traffic from new customers 
the increase in the average revenue received per conventional carloading is principally due to moderate increases in certain freight rates 
the increase in net container freight revenue is the result of an increase in container traffic volume as well as a increase in the average revenue received per container 
total intermodal containers handled increased by  or  to  in from  in the increase in the average revenue per container is attributable to increased rates tied to certain railroad cost indices and to variations in the mix of containers handled 
the increase in container traffic volume is attributable to increased volume from existing customers 
the increase in non freight operating revenues for the year is the result of increased demurrage and other transportation related revenues partially offset by decreases in maintenance departmental billings 
the increase in demurrage revenue is related to the increase in net car hire expense incurred during the year 
non freight operating revenues can vary from year to year depending upon customer needs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  or  to million in from million in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues operating ratio decreased to in from in while operating expenses increased generally  across the board  the more significant increases were in the following areas o diesel fuel increased by  or  to million in from  in as a result of sharply increased prices for petroleum products 
o depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  to million in from million in as a result of significant recent additions to property and equipment 
o net car hire expense increased  or  to  in from  in as previously discussed  this increase has been more than offset by increased demurrage revenue 
other income other income decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in gains from the sale  condemnation and disposal of property  equipment and easements including fiber optics licenses 
in addition included  of income related to the recovery of a portion of an environmental claim paid by the company in prior years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues operating revenues decreased  or  to million in from million in this decrease was comprised of a million decrease in conventional freight revenue  and a  decrease in non freight operating revenues partially offset by a  increase in net container freight revenues 
the decrease in conventional freight revenues is attributable to a decrease in traffic volume and to a decrease in the average revenue received per conventional car loading of 
the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased by  or  to  in from  in ii on june  the rail lines and operations of consolidated rail corporation conrail  with which the company has historically interchanged the majority of its rail freight traffic  were split between csx corporation and norfolk southern railroad 
the company estimates that delays and other service problems attributable to this split up accounted for a traffic reduction of nearly carloadings which were diverted to truck 
the company believes that most of this traffic will be returned to rail once the service problems related to the conrail split up have been overcome 
while the situation has improved  service problems still remained as of the end of during  two of the company s rail freight customers continued to phase out operations which utilized the company s rail freight services 
reduced traffic to these two customers accounted for a reduction of approximately carloadings during the year 
it is anticipated that these two customers will complete the phase out of their rail freight served operations over the next year or two 
the company did experience increased rail freight traffic from several new customers and from certain existing customers which partially offset the traffic declines discussed above 
the reduction in the average revenue received per conventional carloading  between years  is largely attributable to a change in the mix of freight hauled toward lower revenue commodities 
management believes that the average freight received per carloading should increase in the future as freight  temporarily lost to conrail split up related service problems  returns to the railroads 
the increase in container freight revenue was primarily the result of increased container traffic volume 
total intermodal containers handled increased by  or  to  containers in from  containers in the average revenue received per intermodal container increased by approximately 
due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
the increase in container traffic volume results from both new customers and increased volume from existing customers
