item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations flag telecom group of companies flag telecom was incorporated on february  to be the parent company for the flag telecom group of companies 
the principal companies which comprise the flag telecom group of companies are flag limited  flag atlantic limited  flag telecom development limited  flag telecom group services limited  flag asia limited and flag pacific limited 
pursuant to a restructuring on february   flag limited became our owned subsidiary and the other companies then comprising the flag telecom group of companies became our wholly owned subsidiaries  other than flag atlantic limited in which we had a ownership interest 
on january   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in flag limited and flag limited became our wholly owned subsidiary 
on december  we purchased the remaining interest in flag atlantic limited from gts 
the financial information presented in this report comprises the consolidated results of flag limited for the accounting periods to february  and the flag telecom consolidated results for the period from incorporation to december  and for the year ended december  on february   flag telecom completed an initial public offering of common shares 
on march  flag telecom completed a private placement of its senior notes due revenue recognition our primary business to date has been to provide capacity on the fea cable system 
the primary method by which we have provided capacity has been through agreements providing for an outright sale of  or the sale of a right of use of  the capacity for the lifetime of this system 
in addition  the customer becomes responsible for paying the agreed maintenance charges 
we had recognized revenues from capacity transactions on the fea cable system upon the date the risks and rewards of ownership of the relevant capacity were transferred to the customer  which was the date the capacity was made available for activation and the customer became responsible for maintenance charges 
the financial accounting standards board issued a pronouncement fasb interpretation no 
 as a result of which sales of fiber optic cable capacity after june  were to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
the application of this pronouncement has resulted in a deferral of revenue recognition for us gaap purposes for certain capacity contracts that do not satisfy the necessary requirements of fasb interpretation no 
this accounting treatment does not affect our cash flows from customers  who will continue to be liable for payments in accordance with the signed agreements 
fns is a growing part of our portfolio  consisting of managed bandwidth services  lease services and ip transit services 
these are expected to generate recurring revenues for the group 
as a result of extending our range of products and services  we expect the greater part of our future sales to be under agreements which will require us to recognize revenues over the relevant term of these agreements 
to the extent that we enter into contracts in the future that satisfy the requirements for sales type lease accounting  we will recognize revenues without deferral 
we recognize revenues from providing operations and maintenance services in the period in which we provide these services 
we have  in periods prior to june   considered revenues from operating lease transactions to be incidental 
we have therefore recorded these revenues as reductions of the capacity available for sale 
however  as noted above  the magnitude of these transactions has increased such that we now recognize revenues from lease transactions over the term of the leases 
payments due from purchasers of capacity are generally payable within days  however  we have outstanding receivables greater than days 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical industry experience with potential uncollectible receivables and our expectations as to payments 
as of december   we had an allowance of million 
all revenues from capacity sales agreements and billings of operations and maintenance services are payable in us dollars 
all contracts for the provision by third parties of restoration are invoiced to us in us dollars 
some vendor contracts for the provision to the flag europe asia cable system of operations and maintenance services are payable in japanese yen  british pounds  euros  french francs and singapore dollars in addition to us dollars 
whenever deemed appropriate  we have hedged  and may continue to hedge  our exposure to foreign currency movements 
accounting for the capital costs of the flag telecom network we capitalized direct and indirect expenditures incurred in connection with the construction of the flag telecom network 
when a system was ready for commercial service we transferred such expenditures to capacity available for sale and charged a proportion of these expenditures to cost of sales as we recognized revenues from sales of capacity 
in the case of the fea cable system  the amount charged as cost of sales was a function of the allocated costs of construction for each segment and management s estimate of revenues from future capacity sales 
as a result of the application of fasb interpretation no 
 sales on the fea cable system do not satisfy the requirements for sales type lease accounting 
the costs of these segments were reclassified at july  and during the six months ended december  from capacity available for sale to fixed assets and are being depreciated over their remaining useful life 
as a result of extending our range of products and services  we expect the greater part of our future revenue to be under agreements that will be accounted for as operating leases or service contracts and will require us to recognize revenues over the relevant term of the agreements 
we therefore reclassified the remaining cost of the fea cable from capacity available for sale to fixed assets in the first quarter of this cost will be depreciated over the remaining estimated economic life of the system 
the construction costs of the fa  the fp and the fnal cable systems will be amortized over their economic life from the date they are ready for commercial service or will be written off as cost of sales against revenues from any transactions whose terms satisfy the requirements of sales type lease accounting 
capital costs associated with development of the other elements of the flag telecom network will be amortized over their respective economic lives 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  adjusted consolidated results the table below shows the selected statement of operations and cash flow data  in thousands  for the year ended december   being a combination of the results of flag limited for the period from january  to february  and the results of flag telecom for the period from incorporation to december  these results have been adjusted to eliminate minority interests in order to enable a better comparison with the results for the years ended december  and these adjustments will not be reflected in our current and future financial statements 
adjusted year ended in thousands december  revenue capacity sales  operations and maintenance revenues  operating expenses cost of capacity sold  operations and maintenance including non cash compensation expense of   sales and marketing including non cash compensation expense of   general and administrative including non cash compensation expense of   depreciation and amortization  interest expense  interest income  income from affiliates loss before income taxes  provision for taxes  net loss  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  cash revenues  cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from financing activities  cash flows from investing activities  ebitda comprises operating income or loss plus the amounts for the following non cash items depreciation and amortization and cost of capacity sold 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for changes in deferred revenues plus stock compensation 
management believes that these measures give a better view of the cash generation of the business due to the significant non cash items included in the statement of operations 
some of this cash generated is subject to restrictions on use under agreements with lenders who are funding the various elements of the capital costs of the network 
revenues we recognized total revenue during the year ended december  of million compared to million in total revenue for the year ended december  this reduction is due to the application of fasb interpretation no 
 with effect from july  see details below 
we recognized revenue from the sale of capacity of million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  as a result of the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
 with effect from july   certain sales of capacity may no longer be recognized as current revenue because they do not satisfy the requirements for sales type lease accounting 
revenues from these capacity sales are now deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts 
the change to accounting treatment has no impact on cash flows 
as of december   we had entered into sales transactions with in excess of international telecommunication carriers and internet service providers compared to as of december  we recognized revenue from operations and maintenance services of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the increase in cumulative capacity sales and activations on the fea cable system 
we recognized revenue from fns of million for the year ended december  no network services revenue was generated for the year ended december  operating expenses for the year ended december   we recorded million of depreciation compared to million for depreciation and cost of capacity sold recorded in the year ended december  the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
discussed above has meant that the remaining capacity available for sale has been reclassified to property and equipment on january  and is being depreciated over the remaining economic life of the network  rather than being written off as cost of sales 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in network services costs 
no network services costs were incurred for the year ended december  these costs relate primarily to local backhaul  connection and restoration costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in operations and maintenance costs compared to million for the year ended december  operations and maintenance costs relate primarily to the provision of standby maintenance under maintenance zone agreements as well as salaries and overhead expenses directly associated with operations and maintenance activities 
the increase is primarily due to additional costs arising from increased activity plus use of contracted services 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in sales and marketing costs compared to million incurred during the year ended december  sales and marketing costs are comprised of all sales and marketing activities that are directly undertaken by flag telecom 
the increase in sales and marketing costs is due to greater employment and related costs associated with the increased world wide sales and marketing activity 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of general and administrative expenses compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative costs in the year ended december   is largely due to recruitment and salaries of additional staff and increased office related costs 
costs for the year ended december  noted above include charges for non cash compensation expense in respect of stock option awards under our long term incentive plan 
these charges are required under us accounting standards and are purely accounting charges having no effect on cash flows 
interest expense  foreign currency gain  and interest income interest expense on borrowings increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense of million is attributable to additional borrowings obtained 
see also liquidity and capital resources 
the foreign exchange gain of million arises from the translation at the year end of the net euro denominated borrowings from euros to us dollars at the balance sheet exchange rate 
on december   we entered into a cross currency swap to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our euro million senior notes 
during the year ended december  we capitalized million of interest costs as a component of construction in progress 
we earned interest income of million during the year ended december  compared to million earned during the year ended december  interest was earned on cash balances and short term investments held by the collateral trustee for flag limited s credit facility  the restricted cash balances in flag atlantic limited and balance of the proceeds from the ipo and high yield funds held by flag telecom 
provision for taxes the provision for taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes reflected in the accompanying statement of operations consists of taxes incurred on the income earned or activities performed by group companies in certain jurisdictions  where they are deemed to have a taxable presence or are otherwise subject to tax 
at the present time  no income  profit  capital or capital gains taxes are levied in bermuda 
in the event that such taxes are levied  we have received on undertaking from the bermuda government exempting us from all such taxes until march  as bermuda does not impose an income tax  the statutory amount of tax is zero 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   and the period from incorporation to december   results in an effective tax charge that differs from the bermuda tax charge as follows statutory bermuda tax charge current foreign taxes   deferred and other taxes effective tax charge   ebitda we recognized ebitda of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the application of fasb interpretation no 
 which stated that  with effect from july   certain sales of capacity may no longer be recognized as current revenue because they do not satisfy the requirements for sales type lease accounting 
revenues from these capacity sales are now deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts 
based on original expectations under the new measurements  ebitda was positive one year ahead of plans 
adjusted ebitda we recognized adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase includes the effect of the fa presales 
excluding the effect of fa  adjusted ebitda was million for the year  up on cash revenues we recognized cash revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase includes the effect of the fa presales 
excluding the effect of fa  cash revenues were million for the year  up on year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues we recognized total revenue during the year ended december  of million compared to million in total revenue for the year ended december  we recognized revenue from the sale of capacity of million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the reduction in revenue is partly attributable to our deferring the recognition of revenues to subsequent periods as the result of our adoption of fasb interpretation no 
with effect from july  and partly as a result of accounting revenues in including certain non cash items 
as of december   we had entered into sales transactions with over international telecommunication carriers and internet service providers compared to as of december  we recognized revenue from operations and maintenance services of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million for the year ended december  is primarily a result of the increase in cumulative capacity sales on the fea cable system 
operating expenses for the year ended december   we recorded million in respect of the cost of capacity sold compared to million recorded in the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of capacity sold in the year ended december  is primarily a result of lower revenue recognized from capacity sales combined with sales of capacity on segments having a lower cost of sales percentage  computed as described above for that segment  compared to the cost of sales for the segments on which capacity was sold during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred million in operations and maintenance costs compared to million for the year ended december  operations and maintenance costs relate primarily to the provision of standby maintenance under maintenance zone agreements as well as salaries and overhead expenses directly associated with operations and maintenance activities 
the decrease in operations and maintenance costs is largely a result of the termination of the program management services agreement with bell atlantic network systems in may combined with lower costs of some maintenance zone agreements 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in sales and marketing costs compared to million incurred during the year ended december  sales and marketing costs are comprised of all sales and marketing activities that are directly undertaken by us 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of general and administrative expenses compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative costs in the year ended december   is largely due to the non cash compensation expense of million 
costs for the year ended december  noted above include charges for non cash compensation expense in respect of awards under our long term incentive plan 
these charges are required under us accounting standards and are purely accounting charges having no effect on cash flows 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily a result of us adopting fasb interpretation no 
which was effective from july   pursuant to which the cost of part of the fea cable system which does not satisfy the requirements of sales type lease accounting is being depreciated over its remaining economic life 
prior to july   the cost of the fea cable system was wholly accounted for as capacity available for sale for which no depreciation was recorded but which was expensed as cost of capacity sold as revenues were recognized 
interest expense and interest income interest expense on borrowings decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense of million was attributable to a reduction in long term debt facility from million as at december  to million as at december  combined with a million reduction in amortized financing costs 
during the year ended december  we capitalized million of interest costs as a component of construction in progress 
we earned interest income of million during the year ended december  compared to million earned during the year ended december  interest was earned on cash balances and short term investments held by the collateral trustee for flag limited s credit facility or in escrow arising from ongoing business operations 
provision for taxes the provision for taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the tax provisions for these periods consisted of taxes on income derived from capacity sales and standby maintenance revenue from customers in certain jurisdictions along the fea cable system route where we are deemed to have a taxable presence or are otherwise subject to tax 
at the present time  no income  profit  capital or capital gains taxes are levied in bermuda 
in the event that such taxes are levied  we have received an undertaking from the bermuda government exempting us from all such taxes until march  as bermuda does not impose an income tax  the statutory rate of tax is zero 
the effective rate of tax relates to income tax on the activities of subsidiaries of the company in taxable jurisdictions or where the income of subsidiaries is otherwise subject to tax 
extraordinary item in connection with a refinancing that took place on january   we recorded an extraordinary loss of million in the statement of operations for the year ended december  the loss on refinancing represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to flag limited s prior credit facility 
no refinancing occurred in the year ended december  in addition  in connection with the refinancing in january  flag limited redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at a redemption price of of the liquidation preference 
we reflected the million excess of the redemption value over the carrying value of the preferred stock on the date of the redemption as a decrease in additional paid in capital in the year ended december  there were no costs of this nature recorded in the year ended december  ebitda we recognized ebitda of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the application of fasb interpretation no 
 which stated that  with effect from july   certain sales of capacity may no longer be recognized as current revenue because they do not satisfy the requirements for sales type lease accounting 
revenues from these capacity sales are now deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts 
adjusted ebitda we recognized adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in deferred revenues resulting from the application of fasb interpretation no 
cash revenues we recognized cash revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to increased revenues on the fea cable system 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date through a combination of equity contributions  bank debt  the proceeds of debt offerings  and the proceeds of our ipo 
on february  we sold  common shares at per share in our ipo 
we received million in net proceeds from that offering 
on march  we completed our sale of senior notes due in the us and europe  raising net proceeds of million 
on february   flag limited amended its existing credit facilities to consist of a million six year term loan facility million of which remained outstanding at december  and all of which was outstanding at december  and a million revolving credit facility none of which was outstanding at december  and 
dresdner kleinwort benson and barclays capital acted as joint lead arrangers 
these facilities bear interest at a rate of basis points over libor for the first six months and thereafter at a rate of between and basis points over libor  depending on the credit rating of the senior notes of flag limited 
the current interest rate is basis points over libor 
the facilities are secured by a pledge by us of all of the capital stock of flag limited and by assignment of flag limited s contracts and a security interest in its bank accounts and intangible property 
in connection with this amendment  flag limited paid fees and expenses to the joint lead arrangers totaling approximately million 
at the end of march  flag limited entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on flag limited s credit facilities 
under the swap agreements  we paid a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and the swap counterparty paid the floating rate based on libor 
one swap agreement terminated in january and the other swap agreement terminated in july in august we entered into an interest rate collar transaction for an initial notional amount of million  reducing in increments to million in the final quarter 
the transaction terminates on april  the collar is comprised of a libor cap at and a floor of 
we recognize the net cash amount received or paid on interest rate hedging instruments as an adjustment to interest cost on the related debt 
on december   we entered into a cross currency swap to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our e million senior notes 
under the swap agreement we exchanged e million for million 
on june   we will exchange back the million for e million 
at the end of  this transaction was accounted for as a hedge under us gaap  pre adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
see new accounting pronouncements 
flag atlantic limited flag atlantic has a million construction term loan facility of which million was outstanding at december  and a million revolving credit facility none of which was outstanding at december  and 
these facilities have a term of years and bear interest at libor plus basis points for that portion of the loans not to exceed of the outstanding loans which are backed by investment grade receivables and libor plus basis points for the balance of the loans 
flag atlantic has elected  over the course of the construction contract  to cancel million of the un drawn construction term loan facility as a result of capacity pre sales over and above the anticipated pre sale targets 
commitment fees accrue on the undrawn balance of the loans at between basis points and basis points 
in october  flag atlantic entered into an interest rate collar transaction for an initial notional amount of million  increasing in increments to million in the final quarter of the transaction terminates on november  the collar is comprised of a libor cap at and a floor of 
we recognized the net cash amount received or paid on interest rate hedging instruments as an adjustment to interest cost on the related debt 
flag atlantic s bank facility is secured by an assignment of all of flag atlantic s assets and a pledge of all of the stock in flag atlantic 
on december  we completed the purchase from gts of its interest in flag atlantic  the joint venture that is building the fa cable system 
flag atlantic has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of flag telecom from the acquisition date 
under the terms of the agreement  gts receives million in cash from flag telecom  and flag telecom assumes flag atlantic s cash of million at december   which is restricted to use for flag atlantic purposes only  along with all other remaining assets and liabilities of flag atlantic 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the excess of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill 
the initial purchase price allocation is based on current estimates 
the company will make final purchase price allocations based upon the final values for certain assets and liabilities 
as a result  the final purchase price allocation may differ from the presented estimate 
funding arrangements for the project  including all pre sale commitments of million  are unaffected 
the undersea survey for the fp cable system has been completed 
we expect to fund the costs required to complete the project from some of the proceeds from our ipo and the proceeds from our senior notes offering and other debt financings and pre sales 
as of december   the group had net current assets of million compared to net current liabilities of million  at december  the working capital deficit at december  was primarily a result of the accounts payable to contractors which are classified as current liabilities but for which the associated funds held in escrow were classified as a non current asset and were hence excluded from working capital 
total cash provided by operating activities was million and that used in investing activities was million  during the twelve months ended december  at december   cash on deposit  or with the collateral trustee or in escrow had increased to  million from million at december   primarily as a result of the additional funds obtained from the ipo of million and from the senior notes offering of million 
total cash provided by operating activities was million and that used in investing activities was million  during the twelve months ended december  assets one of our primary assets is the remaining capital cost of the flag telecom network and construction in progress recorded in property and equipment totaling  million 
as a result of the application of fasb interpretation no 
 the costs of certain segments of the flag telecom network were reclassified from capacity available for sale to fixed assets and are being depreciated over their remaining useful life 
as a result of extending our range of products and services  we expect the greater part of our future revenue to be under agreements that will be accounted for as operating leases or service contracts and will require us to recognize revenues over the relevant terms of the agreements 
we have therefore reclassified the remaining cost of the flag telecom network from capacity available for sale to fixed assets in the first quarter of this cost will be depreciated over the remaining estimated economic life of the system 
the capitalised costs incurred in the construction of the various flag telecom cable systems under construction have been included in construction in progress 
these are comprised of fa  million  fnal  million and fp  million  as of december  see additional discussion on the progress of the assets under construction contained in item  under the flag telecom network 
our other property and equipment consist primarily of office furniture  leasehold improvements  computer equipment and motor vehicles totaling million as of december  accounts receivable the accounts receivable balance at december  of million includes million relating to sales contracts payable in accordance with agreed payment schedules over periods up to one year and due for payment on normal payment terms on invoicing 
the comparable figure at december  was million 
impact of the introduction and adoption of the euro on january   eleven of the member countries of the european union  including france  germany  ireland  italy and spain  where flag telecom has operations  established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and a new currency called the euro e 
these countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
hereafter and until january   the existing sovereign currencies will remain legal tender in these countries 
on january   the euro is scheduled to replace the sovereign legal currencies of these countries 
flag telecom has operations within the european union including many of the countries that have adopted the euro 
the group continues to evaluate the impact the euro will have on its continuing business operations within the overall scope of managing currency risk 
however  the group does not expect the introduction of the euro to have a material effect on the group s financial position or competitive position 
inflation in management s view  inflation in operating  maintenance and general and administrative costs will not have a material effect on our financial position over the long term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk 
we are exposed to a degree of foreign currency risk in our international operations 
the value of the liability of the e million of senior notes  as expressed in us dollars on our balance sheet  is dependent on the us dollar euro exchange rate at each balance sheet date 
the change in this liability over a period is reflected in our income statement in accordance with us gaap 
we have entered into a cross currency swap agreement to hedge the effect of changes in the exchange rate 
the hedge is for a period of months  after which time we will review the exposure again and may enter into further hedge transactions if considered appropriate 
other than this  we do not believe that we are exposed to significant risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
all capacity and operations and maintenance revenues are payable in us dollars 
all contracts for the provision by third parties of restoration are invoiced to us in us dollars 
we also invoice some fns products in local currencies 
some contracts with suppliers of services to our fns business are payable in currencies other than us dollars 
some vendor contracts for the provision to the fea cable system of operations and maintenance services and local operating expenses of our subsidiary companies are payable in currencies other than us dollars 
management believes that these exposures are not material to our financial position 
whenever deemed appropriate  we may hedge our exposure to foreign currency movements 
the impact of the introduction of the euro is discussed in item in the liquidity and capital resources section 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in our financing instruments 
our long term financing is provided by fixed rate senior notes and floating rate bank debt 
we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with high credit quality 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties

sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows gains and losses on a derivative to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and cannot be applied retroactively 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
s   and may have a material impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the company  but is unable to estimate the effects of adoption at this time 
specifically  the company believes that the following changes in its accounting policies will result from the adoption of sfas no 
the company currently considers certain interest rate collars as hedges under which payments due to or from the counterparties are recorded as an increase or reduction in expense 
the company believes that these interest rate collars will be recorded as effective cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
and  accordingly  changes in the intrinsic value associated with the interest rate collars will be recorded directly to other accumulated comprehensive income and changes in the time value of the interest rate collars will be recorded directly to current period earnings 
the company currently accounts for a cross currency swap arrangement as a hedge of the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency 
the company believes that this cross currency swap will not be recorded under the hedge accounting provisions of sfas no 
and consequently changes in the fair value of the cross currency swap arrangement and fluctuation in the value of the underlying debt which are expected to be equal and opposite  will both be recorded through current period earnings after adoption of sfas no
