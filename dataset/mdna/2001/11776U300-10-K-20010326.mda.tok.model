the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair market values at the date of the acquisition 
of the total purchase price  we allocated million to acquired in process research and development  million to goodwill and other intangible assets and million to working capital and tangible assets 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation and has been recorded as a charge to expense because its technological feasibility had not been established and it had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition

the increase in the effective tax rate in over was due primarily to the effect of the non deductibility of losses from our international operations 
the effective rate in was positively affected by the tax benefit of interest income earned on tax advantaged municipal securities held in our short term investment portfolio  and was negatively affected by the non deductibility of in process research and development and amortization of intangible assets 
pro forma cash basis net income pro forma cash basis net income  which excludes deferred stock option compensation  acquired in process research and development  amortization intangible assets  and acquisition related costs  is as follows year ended december  in thousands net income   acquired in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets  net of tax effect  amortization of deferred stock option compensation  net of tax effect acquisition related expense  net of tax effect cash basis net income    diluted earnings per share weighted average shares outstanding to compute diluted earnings per share    the pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in october  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock and raised million  net of offering costs 
in addition  in september  we sold  shares of our common stock to vulcan ventures for approximately million 
in january  we issued mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock from which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with this transaction  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million 
our working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of  in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income from operations excluding acquired in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in and increases in deferred revenue  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in investing activities for were primarily purchases of capital equipment 
investing activities in included million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of leasehold improvements and capital equipment primarily associated with the move to our corporate headquarters in bellevue  washington 
investing activities in included million in net cash used in connection with the acquisition of mainbrace corporation  million of cash used for the acquisition of smaller scale companies and the purchase of strategic investments and million of capital equipment purchases 
financing activities generated million in  primarily through the issuance of mandatorily convertible preferred stock  partially offset by repayment of shareholder loans and the million repurchase of shares of common stock 
financing activities in generated million due to the net proceeds from the initial public offering and from the sale of common stock to vulcan ventures 
financing activities generated million in due to proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  the exercise of stock options and the exercise of warrants by former bluewater systems  inc shareholders 
we have a working capital revolving line of credit with imperial bank that is secured by our accounts receivable 
this facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable or million and bears interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at january  the facility expires in july the agreement  under which the line of credit was established contains certain covenants  including a provision requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and at that time there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
we lease approximately  square feet in a single facility located in bellevue  washington pursuant to a lease  which expires in in september  we signed a lease for approximately  square feet in sunnyvale  california  which expires in december additionally  we have lease commitments for office space in eden prairie  minnesota  tokyo  japan  and munich  germany 
the annual cost of these leases is an aggregate of approximately million  subject to annual adjustments 
although we have no other material commitments  we anticipate an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in our operations  infrastructure and personnel 
the rate of growth of our revenue over the prior year was from to  from to  and from to the rate of growth of our revenue over prior periods may continue to decline 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant increases in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we enter new markets for our products and services  increase research and development activities and sales and marketing activities  develop new distribution channels and broaden our professional service capabilities 
these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate  and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses 
if we fail to increase our revenue to keep pace with our expenses  we may experience losses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we believe that we will be able to meet our anticipated cash needs after that time from cash generated from operations and do not currently anticipate the need to raise additional capital 
if we do seek to raise additional capital  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may use a portion of our available cash to acquire additional businesses  products and technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future business 
pending such uses  we will invest our surplus cash in government securities and other short term  investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as a part of a hedge transaction and  if it is the type of hedge transaction 
subsequent to the issuance of sfas no 
 the fasb received multiple requests for clarification of certain implementation issues 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 responding to those requests by amending certain provisions of sfas no 
these amendments include allowing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities to qualify for hedge accounting  permitting the offsetting of certain inter entity foreign currency exposures that reduce the need for third party derivatives and redefining the nature of interest rate risk to avoid sources of ineffectiveness 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective january  the company does not expect that the effect of adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the impact of this statement is on future periods in unknown  but could result in increased volatility in our earnings and other comprehensive income

we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  although we may do so in the future 
investment risk 
we have investments in voting capital stock of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership is less than and we do not have significant influence 
to the extent that the capital stock held is in a public company and the securities have a quoted market price  then the investment is marked to market
