item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of radio stations and our acquisition of other media businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
historically  the principal sources of our revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
in  we expanded our sources of revenue and product offerings with the acquisition of other media businesses 
the following table shows gross broadcasting revenue  the percentage of gross broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source and net broadcasting revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national    local    advertising national    local    infomercials    salem radio network    other    gross broadcasting revenue    less agency commissions    net broadcasting revenue    our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge and by the advertising rates our radio stations and network charge 
the rates for block program time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and network s ability to produce results for its advertisers 
historically we have not subscribed to traditional audience measuring services 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audience 
with the launch of the contemporary christian music format in several markets  we have started to subscribe to arbitron which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
see business radio stations 
each of our radio stations and our network have a general pre determined level of time that they make available for block programs and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
in recent years  we have begun to place greater emphasis on the development of local advertising in all of our markets 
we encourage general managers and sales managers to increase advertising revenue 
we can create additional advertising revenue in a variety of ways  such as removing block programming that generates marginal audience response  adjusting the start time of programs to add advertising in more desirable time slots and increasing advertising rates 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block program time does not tend to vary  however  since program rates are generally set annually 
our cash flow is affected by a transition period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial or advisable to change its format 
this transition period is when we develop a radio station s customer and listener base 
during this period  a station will typically generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging  in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include employee salaries and commissions  and facility expenses for example  rent and utilities 
beginning in  in connection with the launch of our contemporary christian music format in several markets  we incurred increased amounts for promotional expenses and music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
oneplace earns its revenue from the sales of banner advertising and sponsorships on the internet  sales of streaming services  and sales of software and software support contracts 
ccm earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as other media on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the performance of a radio broadcasting company  such as salem  is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate broadcast cash flow and ebitda 
we define broadcast cash flow as net operating income  excluding other media revenue and other media operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization and corporate expenses 
we define ebitda as net operating income before depreciation and amortization 
we define after tax cash flow as income loss before extraordinary item minus gain loss on disposal of assets net of income tax plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda and after tax cash flow for the year ended december  excludes a million charge million  net of income tax for a one time stock grant concurrent with our initial public offering on june  although broadcast cash flow  ebitda and after tax cash flow are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles  we believe that broadcast cash flow  ebitda and after tax cash flow are useful because they are generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as measures of performance and are used by analysts who report on the performance of broadcast companies 
these measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in the following discussion of our results of operations  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
for the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december   we included in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and network formats that we owned or operated for all of both periods  we acquired or began to operate at any time after the beginning of the first relevant comparison period if the station or network format i was in a market in which we already owned or operated a radio station or network format and ii was integrated with the existing station or network format for our internal financial reporting purposes  or we sold or ceased to operate at any time after the beginning of the first relevant comparison period if the station or network format i was integrated with another station or network format in a market for our internal financial reporting purposes prior to the sale or cessation of operations and ii we continued to own or operate the other station or network format following the sale or cessation of operations 
we included in our same station comparisons the results of operations of our integrated stations and network formats from the date that we acquired or began to operate them or through the date that we sold or ceased to operate them  as the case may be 
for the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december   we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the current period compared with the results of the same stations for the corresponding period of the prior year 
we do not include a station or a network in this comparison unless it has been owned or operated for at least an entire quarter included in each of the current and corresponding prior year periods
